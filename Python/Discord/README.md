- The first time I uploaded on Github, I forgot my token must be private.
- So, I changed the token in my Desktop by latest for security, but in github; there is older token in code.

- Bot can do these things:
  
**$HELLO** : Says hello to chat.

**$HELP** : Shows all commands in detail.

**$QUOTE** : Displays random quote or plays a game about that.
