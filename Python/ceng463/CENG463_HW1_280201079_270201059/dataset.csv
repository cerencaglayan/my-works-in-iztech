AMPK role in epilepsy: a promising therapeutic target?,"['YingbeiQi', 'Yong-MeiZhang', 'Ya-NanGao', 'Wen-GangChen', 'TingZhou', 'LiuliuChang', 'YiZang', 'JiaLi']","Epilepsy is a complex and multifaceted neurological disorder characterized by spontaneous and recurring seizures. It poses significant therapeutic challenges due to its diverse etiology and often-refractory nature. This comprehensive review highlights the pivotal role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key metabolic regulator involved in cellular energy homeostasis, which may be a promising therapeutic target for epilepsy. Current therapeutic strategies such as antiseizure medication (ASMs) can alleviate seizures (up to 70%). However, 30% of epileptic patients may develop refractory epilepsy. Due to the complicated nature of refractory epilepsy, other treatment options such as ketogenic dieting, adjunctive therapy, and in limited cases, surgical interventions are employed. These therapy options are only suitable for a select group of patients and have limitations of their own. Current treatment options for epilepsy need to be improved. Emerging evidence underscores a potential association between impaired AMPK functionality in the brain and the onset of epilepsy, prompting an in-depth examination of AMPK's influence on neural excitability and ion channel regulation, both critical factors implicated in epileptic seizures. AMPK activation through agents such as metformin has shown promising antiepileptic effects in various preclinical and clinical settings. These effects are primarily mediated through the inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway, activation of the AMPK-PI3K-c-Jun pathway, and stimulation of the PGC-1α pathway. Despite the potential of AMPK-targeted therapies, several aspects warrant further exploration, including the detailed mechanisms of AMPK's role in different brain regions, the impact of AMPK under various conditional circumstances such as neural injury and zinc toxicity, the long-term safety and efficacy of chronic metformin use in epilepsy treatment, and the potential benefits of combination therapy involving AMPK activators. Moreover, the efficacy of AMPK activators in refractory epilepsy remains an open question. This review sets the stage for further research with the aim of enhancing our understanding of the role of AMPK in epilepsy, potentially leading to the development of more effective, AMPK-targeted therapeutic strategies for this challenging and debilitating disorder.",brain injury
Pediatric retroclival hematomas.,"['Yahya HKhormi', 'Mohamed MAly', 'Hossam KHamda', 'Aly AbdelrahmanYousef', 'Adel IbrahimHanbashi', 'Mostafa M EAtteya']","Traumatic retroclival hematomas (RCHs) are infrequent occurrences among the pediatric population. The existing body of research pertaining to these hematomas primarily consists of case reports or small case series, which do not provide adequate guidance for managing this condition.
This study aims to present a report on four cases of RCHs. Additionally, we aim to conduct a systematic review to consolidate the existing literature on pediatric RCHs.
The authors conducted a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA and CARE guidelines. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to evaluate the potential impact of various clinical variables on clinical outcomes. The study also documented four of our cases, one of which was a rare occurrence of spontaneous subdural RCH.
A total of 62 traumatic RCHs have been documented in the literature. We documented three cases of traumatic RCHs and one case of spontaneous RCH. A systematic analysis of 65 traumatic RCHs was performed. Of trauma cases, 64.6% demonstrated craniocervical junction instability with 83.3% ligamentous involvement. Thirty-five patients were males. 50.7% were aged between 5 and 9 years. Cranial nerve palsies occurred in 29 patients (27 had abducent palsy), 26 of which resolved within 6 months of trauma. 23.5% underwent surgery, and 76.5% were conservatively managed. Surgeries targeted hematomas, hydrocephalus, or craniocervical instability. Approaches to hematomas included transclival and far/extreme lateral suboccipital approaches. Clinical outcome was good in 75.4% and intermediate or poor in 24.6%. Logistic regression suggested an association between craniocervical junction injuries and poor or intermediate outcomes (OR 4.88, 95% CI (1.17, 27.19), p = 0.04).
Pediatric RCHs are mostly traumatic and extradural. Children between 5 and 9 years old are most vulnerable. Craniocervical junction injuries, mainly ligamentous, are common in RCHs and are associated with intermediate or poor outcomes. Cervical MRI could be important in cases of trauma to rule out ligamentous injuries of the craniocervical junction. The small size of RCHs should not exempt the careful assessment of craniocervical junction instability. Cranial nerve palsies are common and usually resolve within 6 months. Conservative treatment is typical unless brainstem compression, hydrocephalus, or craniocervical junction instability exists.",brain injury
Gandouling alleviates nerve injury through PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 and Sirt1/FoxO1 signaling pathway to inhibit autophagy in the rats model of Wilson's disease.,"['LiChen', 'WangyangXu', 'YutingZhang', 'HaoChen', 'YanquanHan']","Previous studies have shown that Gandouling (GDL) may alleviate the nerve damage caused by Wilson's disease (WD) by inhibiting the autophagy of nerve cell mitochondria. However, its mechanisms are still unclear. Revealing the therapeutic mechanism of GDL is beneficial for its clinical application and provides theoretical support for the development of new formulations for treating WD.
This time we found that the oxidative stress level in the body of the copper-overloaded WD rates increased, neurons in the hippocampus were damaged, and autophagy occurred. GDL reversed these situations and significantly improved the learning, memory, and spatial cognitive abilities of the high-copper-loaded WD rates. After GDL intervention, the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated serine-threonine protein kinase (AKT), and phosphorylated forkhead box protein O1 (FoxO1) significantly increased, whereas FoxO1 in the nucleus decreased and phosphorylated FoxO1 in the cytoplasm also significantly raised. In addition, the expression of Sirt1 significantly declined, and Ac-FoxO1 in the nucleus also significantly increased.
These data indicated that GDL may promote the phosphorylation of FoxO1 and promote its nucleation by activating the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signaling pathway and inhibit Ac-FoxO1 hydrolysis in the nucleus through the Sirt1/FoxO1 signaling pathway to suppress the transcriptional activity of FoxO1.
Furthermore, it inhibited the expression of autophagy genes Atg12 and Gabarapl1. In summary, our work provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of GDL repairing WD neuronal damage through autophagy pathways.",brain injury
Anti-CD49d Antibody Treatment Improves Survival and Attenuates Neurocognitive Deficits after Traumatic Brain Injury in Aged Mice.,"['ZhangyingChen', 'KacieFord', 'MeccaIslam', 'SupinyaIamsawat', 'BookerDavis', 'CraigWeiss', 'StevenSchwulst']","Patients aged 65 and older account for an increasing proportion of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Aged TBI patients suffer increased morbidity and mortality compared to young TBI patients. We previously demonstrated a marked accumulation of CD8 + T-cells within the brains of aged TBI mice compared to young TBI mice. Therefore, we hypothesized that blocking peripheral T-cell infiltration into the injured brain would improve neurocognitive outcomes in aged mice after TBI. Young and aged male C57BL/6 mice underwent TBI via controlled cortical impact vs. sham injury. Two hours-post injuries, mice received an anti-CD49d antibody (aCD49d Ab) to block peripheral lymphocyte infiltration or its isotype control. Dosing was repeated every two weeks. Mortality was tracked. Neurocognitive testing for anxiety, associative learning, and memory was assessed. Motor function was evaluated. Plasma was collected for cytokine analysis. Flow cytometry was employed to phenotype different immune cells within the brains. Consequently, aCD49d Ab treatment significantly improved post-TBI survival, anxiety level, associative learning, memory, and motor function in aged mice two months post-TBI compared to isotype control treated mice. aCD49d Ab treatment augmented Th2 response in the plasma of aged mice two months post-TBI compared to isotype control-treated mice. Notably, aCD49d Ab treatment significantly reduced activated CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells within aged mouse brains after TBI. Contrastingly, no difference was detected in young mice after aCD49d Ab treatment. Collectively, aCD49 Ab treatment reduced T-cells in the injured brain, improved survival, and attenuated neurocognitive and gait deficits. Hence, aCD49d Ab may be a promising therapeutic intervention in aged TBI subjects-a population often excluded in TBI clinical trials.",brain injury

Prolonged mechanical ventilation allows stabilizing the patient's status, but can result severe complications including tracheoesophageal fistula. Our patient received severe combined injury after road accident, i.e. compression-comminuted fractures of DIV, DV, DVI vertebrae with spinal cord compression, ThIII compression fracture, compression-comminuted fracture of bodies and arches ThIV, V, VI with ThVI dislocation, lower paraplegia and pelvic organ dysfunction, left-sided laryngeal paresis, brain concussion and contusion of both lungs. Mechanical ventilation has been performed for 1.5 months. The patient suffered inflammatory complications: bilateral pneumonia complicated by right-sided pleural empyema, sepsis, tracheostomy suppuration followed by cervical soft tissue abscess. Pleural drainage and debridement, as well as drainage of abscess were performed. At the same time, we diagnosed external esophageal fistula at the CVII level. Tracheoesophageal fistula closure via cervical access was carried out at the first stage. Postoperative period was uneventful. After 20 days, we performed spondylosynthesis Th

Inhibition of Cyclophilin A-Metalloproteinase-9 Pathway Alleviates the Development of Neuropathic Pain by Promoting Repair of the Blood-Spinal Cord Barrier.,"['YuWang', 'ChenchenWang', 'XuliYang', 'KunNi', 'LiJiang', 'LiXu', 'QiLiu', 'XuanXu', 'XiaopingGu', 'YueLiu', 'ZhengliangMa']","Dysfunction of the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) contributes to the occurrence and development of neuropathic pain (NP). Previous studies revealed that the activation of cyclophilin A (CypA)-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) signaling pathway can disrupt the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and aggravate neuroinflammatory responses. However, the roles of CypA-MMP9 signaling pathway on BSCB in NP have not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the effect of CypA on the structure and function of the BSCB and pain behaviors in mice with NP.
We first created the mouse chronic constriction injury (CCI) model, and they were then intraperitoneally injected with the CypA inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) or vehicle. Pain behaviors, the structure and function of the BSCB, the involvement of the CypA-MMP9 signaling pathway, microglia activation, and expression levels of proinflammatory factors in mice were examined.
CCI mice presented mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, impaired permeability of the BSCB, downregulated tight junction proteins, activated CypA-MMP9 signaling pathway, microglia activation, and upregulated proinflammatory factors, which were significantly alleviated by inhibition of CypA.
Collectively, the CypA-MMP9 signaling pathway is responsible for CCI-induced NP in mice by impairing the structure and function of the BSCB, and activating microglia and inflammatory responses.",brain injury
COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy decreases inflammatory cytokines: a randomized controlled trial.,"['FebenHabtehyimer', 'XianmingZhu', 'Andrew DRedd', 'Kelly AGebo', 'Alison GAbraham', 'Eshan UPatel', 'OliverLaeyendecker', 'Thomas JGniadek', 'Reinaldo EFernandez', 'Owen RBaker', 'MalathiRam', 'Edward RCachay', 'Judith SCurrier', 'YurikoFukuta', 'Jonathan MGerber', 'Sonya LHeath', 'BarryMeisenberg', 'Moises AHuaman', 'Adam CLevine', 'AarthiShenoy', 'ShwetaAnjan', 'Janis EBlair', 'DanielCruser', 'Donald NForthal', 'Laura LHammitt', 'SebleKassaye', 'Giselle SMosnaim', 'BelaPatel', 'James HPaxton', 'Jay SRaval', 'Catherine GSutcliffe', 'MatthewAbinante', 'Kevin SOei', 'ValerieCluzet', 'Marie ElenaCordisco', 'BenjaminGreenblatt', 'WilliamRausch', 'DavidShade', 'Amy LGawad', 'Sabra LKlein', 'AndrewPekosz', 'ShmuelShoham', 'ArturoCasadevall', 'Evan MBloch', 'DanielHanley', 'Aaron A RTobian', 'David JSullivan']",This study examined the role that cytokines may have played in the beneficial outcomes found when outpatient individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 were transfused with COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) early in their infection. We found that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 decreased significantly faster in patients treated early with CCP. Participants with COVID-19 treated with CCP later in the infection did not have the same effect. This decrease in IL-6 levels after early CCP treatment suggests a possible role of inflammation in COVID-19 progression. The evidence of IL-6 involvement brings insight into the possible mechanisms involved in CCP treatment mitigating SARS-CoV-2 severity.,brain injury
In Vitro Detection of S100B and Severity Evaluation of Traumatic Brain Injury Based on Biomimetic Peptide-Modified Nanochannels.,"['WenyuanZhang', 'JianruiZhang', 'YijunWang', 'SenyaoWang', 'YitianWu', 'WenchangZhang', 'MinghuiWu', 'LiWang', 'GuohengXu', 'FuanDeng', 'WenchaoLiu', 'ZhengweiLiu', 'LuChen', 'KaiXiao', 'LuZhang']","The diagnosis and evaluation of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are crucial steps toward the treatment and prognosis of patients. A common question remains as to whether it is possible to introduce an ideal device for signal detection and evaluation that can directly connect digital signals with TBI, thereby enabling prompt response of the evaluation signal and sensitive and specific functioning of the detection process. Herein, a method is presented utilizing polymetric porous membranes with TRTK-12 peptide-modified nanochannels for the detection of S100B (a TBI biomarker) and assessment of TBI severity. The method leverages the specific bonding force between TRTK-12 peptide and S100B protein, along with the nanoconfinement effect of nanochannels, to achieve high sensitivity (LOD: 0.002 ng mL",brain injury
"Citrate-coated silver nanoparticles loaded with agomelatine provide neuronal therapy in acute cerebral ischemia/reperfusion of rats by inhibiting the oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and P2X7 receptor-mediated inflammasome.","['VolkanGelen', 'SeçkinÖzkanlar', 'AdemKara', 'AliYeşildağ']","Cerebral ischemia and reperfusion are related to various situations like injuries after various traumas, oxidative stress, increased calcium ion, capillary hypoperfusion, microvascular hyperpermeability, leukocyte infiltration, and blood-brain barrier disruption. An antidepressant Agomelatine which is a melatonin receptor (MT1/MT2) agonist and serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) antagonist has been reported by studies to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. In our study, we aimed to detect the effects of citrate-coated silver nanoparticle-loaded agomelatine application on neurodegeneration, endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagic and apoptotic cell death, inflammation, and P2X7R expression in the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion model to facilitate the passage of blood-brain barrier. Forty two Sprague-Dawley rats in total were divided into six equal groups (n:7) and applications were performed. Acute cerebral injury in the ischemia-reperfusion model was created 2 h after internal carotid artery ligation in rats and then at the 2nd hour of reperfusion citrate-coated silver nanoparticles loaded with Agomelatine were applied. Twenty four hours later, neurologic analysis on animals in experimental groups was performed, animals were decapitated and GSH, GPx, SOD, CAT, MDA, IL-1β, and TNF-α parameters were examined after taking blood and the cerebral tissue samples. As a result, it was determined that ischemia-reperfusion caused endoplasmic reticulum stress in the cerebral tissues and thus caused cellular injury.",brain injury
Phenotyping of Macrophages After Radiolabeling and Safety of Intra-arterial Transplantation Assessed by SPECT/CT and MRI.,"['IdaFriberger', 'VamsiGontu', 'Robert AHarris', 'Thuy ATran', 'JohanLundberg', 'StaffanHolmin']","Cell therapy is an integral modality of regenerative medicine. Macrophages are known for their sensitivity to activation stimuli and capability to recruit other immune cells to the sites of injury and healing. In addition, the route of administration can impact engraftment and efficacy of cell therapy, and modern neuro-interventional techniques provide the possibility for selective intra-arterial (IA) delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) with very low risk. The effects of radiolabelling and catheter transport on differentially activated macrophages were evaluated. Furthermore, the safety of selective IA administration of these macrophages to the rabbit brain was assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) and ultra-high-field (9.4 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Heart rate fragmentation and brain MRI markers of small vessel disease in MESA.,"['Susan RHeckbert', 'Paul NJensen', 'GurayErus', 'Ilya MNasrallah', 'TanweerRashid', 'MohamadHabes', 'Thomas RAustin', 'James SFloyd', 'Christopher LSchaich', 'SusanRedline', 'R NickBryan', 'Madalena DCosta']","Heart rate (HR) fragmentation indices quantify breakdown of HR regulation and are associated with atrial fibrillation and cognitive impairment. Their association with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of small vessel disease is unexplored.
In 606 stroke-free participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (mean age 67), HR fragmentation indices including percentage of inflection points (PIP) were derived from sleep study recordings. We examined PIP in relation to white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, total white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), and microbleeds from 3-Tesla brain MRI completed 7 years later.
In adjusted analyses, higher PIP was associated with greater WMH volume (14% per standard deviation [SD], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2, 27%, P = 0.02) and lower WM FA (-0.09 SD per SD, 95% CI: -0.16, -0.01, P = 0.03).
HR fragmentation was associated with small vessel disease. HR fragmentation can be measured automatically from ambulatory electrocardiogram devices and may be useful as a biomarker of vascular brain injury.",brain injury
Enhanced VEGF secretion and blood-brain barrier disruption: Radiation-mediated inhibition of astrocyte autophagy via PI3K-AKT pathway activation.,"['ShifengZhang', 'MingpingLi', 'YueminQiu', 'JunyuWu', 'XueXu', 'QianMa', 'ZhihuiZheng', 'GengxinLu', 'ZhezhiDeng', 'HaiweiHuang']","Radiation-induced damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the recognized pathological basis of radiation-induced brain injury (RBI), a side effect of head and neck cancer treatments. There is currently a lack of therapeutic approaches for RBI due to the ambiguity of its underlying mechanisms. Therefore, it is essential to identify these mechanisms in order to prevent RBI or provide early interventions. One crucial factor contributing to BBB disruption is the radiation-induced activation of astrocytes and oversecretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Mechanistically, the PI3K-AKT pathway can inhibit cellular autophagy, leading to pathological cell aggregation. Moreover, it acts as an upstream pathway of VEGF. In this study, we observed the upregulation of the PI3K-AKT pathway in irradiated cultured astrocytes through bioinformatics analysis, we then validated these findings in animal brains and in vitro astrocytes following radiation exposure. Additionally, we also found the inhibition of autophagy and the oversecretion of VEGF in irradiated astrocytes. By inhibiting the PI3K-AKT pathway or promoting cellular autophagy, we observed a significant amelioration of the inhibitory effect on autophagy, leading to reductions in VEGF oversecretion and BBB disruption. In conclusion, our study suggests that radiation can inhibit autophagy and promote VEGF oversecretion by upregulating the PI3K-AKT pathway in astrocytes. Blocking the PI3K pathway can alleviate both of these effects, thereby mitigating damage to the BBB in patients undergoing radiation treatment.",brain injury
Clinical and genetic analysis of infants with Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 6 caused by RARS2 variations.,"['ShichaoZhao', 'RuofeiLian', 'LiangJin', 'MengchunLi', 'TianmingJia', 'FalinXu', 'KaixianDu', 'LijunWang', 'QiliangGuo', 'YanDong']","Defects in RARS2 cause cerebellopontine hypoplasia type 6 (Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 6, PCH6, OMIM: #611523), a rare autosomal recessive inherited mitochondrial disease. Here, we report two male patients and their respective family histories.
We describe the clinical presentation and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of these patients. Whole-exome sequencing was used to identify the genetic mutations.
One patient showed hypoglycemia, high lactic acid levels (fluctuating from 6.7 to 14.1 mmol/l), and frequent seizures after birth, with progressive atrophy of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and pons. The other patient presented with early infantile developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (EIDEEs) with an initial developmental delay followed by infantile epileptic spasm syndrome (IESS) at 5 months old, with no imaging changes. Whole-exome sequencing identified compound heterozygous RARS2 variants c.25A>G (p.I9V) with c.1261C>T (p.Q421 *) and c.1A>G (p.M1V) with c.122A>G (p.D41G) in these two patients. Of these loci, c.1261C>T and c.122A>G have not been previously reported.
Our findings have expanded the RARS2 gene variant spectrum, and present EIDEEs and IESS as phenotypes which deepened the association between PCH6 and RARS2.",brain injury

The role of astrocytes in the glymphatic network: a narrative review.,"['NikitaDas', 'RaviDhamija', 'SumitSarkar']","To date, treatment of Central Nervous System (CNS) pathology has largely focused on neuronal structure and function. Yet, revived attention towards fluid circulation within the CNS has exposed the need to further explore the role of glial cells in maintaining homeostasis within neural networks. In the past decade, discovery of the neural glymphatic network has revolutionized traditional understanding of fluid dynamics within the CNS. Advancements in neuroimaging have revealed alternative pathways of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) generation and efflux. Here, we discuss emerging perspectives on the role of astrocytes in CSF hydrodynamics, with particular focus on the contribution of aquaporin-4 channels to the glymphatic network. Astrocytic structural features and expression patterns are detailed in relation to their function in maintaining integrity of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) as part of the neurovascular unit (NVU). This narrative also highlights the potential role of glial dysfunction in pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease, hydrocephalus, intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and traumatic brain injury. The purpose of this literature summary is to provide an update on the changing landscape of scientific theory surrounding production, flow, and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid. The overarching aim of this narrative review is to advance the conception of basic, translational, and clinical research endeavors investigating glia as therapeutic targets for neurological disease.",brain injury
Vagus Nerve Stimulation in Ischemic Stroke.,"['SasanAndalib', 'Afshin ADivani', 'CenkAyata', 'SheharyarBaig', 'Ethem MuratArsava', 'Mehmet AkifTopcuoglu', 'Eder LeonardoCáceres', 'VinayParikh', 'Masoom JDesai', 'ArshadMajid', 'SaraGirolami', 'MarioDi Napoli']","Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for neurological and psychiatric disorders. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in VNS for treating ischemic stroke. This review discusses the evidence supporting VNS as a treatment option for ischemic stroke and elucidates its underlying mechanisms.
Preclinical studies investigating VNS in stroke models have shown reduced infarct volumes and improved neurological deficits. Additionally, VNS has been found to reduce reperfusion injury. VNS may promote neuroprotection by reducing inflammation, enhancing cerebral blood flow, and modulating the release of neurotransmitters. Additionally, VNS may stimulate neuroplasticity, thereby facilitating post-stroke recovery. The Food and Drug Administration has approved invasive VNS (iVNS) combined with rehabilitation for ischemic stroke patients with moderate to severe upper limb deficits. However, iVNS is not feasible in acute stroke due to its time-sensitive nature. Non-invasive VNS (nVNS) may be an alternative approach for treating ischemic stroke. While the evidence from preclinical studies and clinical trials of nVNS is promising, the mechanisms through which VNS exerts its beneficial effects on ischemic stroke are still being elucidated. Therefore, further research is needed to better understand the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of nVNS in ischemic stroke. Moreover, large-scale randomized clinical trials are necessary to determine the optimal nVNS protocols, assess its long-term effects on stroke recovery and outcomes, and identify the potential benefits of combining nVNS with other rehabilitation strategies.",brain injury
Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 inhibitors as therapeutic drugs for traumatic brain injury.,"['AngelSunny', 'Raisa RaniJames', 'Swathi RadhakrishnanMenon', 'SwethaRayaroth', 'AbhijithDaniel', 'Namita AnnThompson', 'BinuTharakan']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among young adults and the elderly. In the United States, TBI is responsible for around 30 percent of all injuries brought on by injuries. Vasogenic cerebral edema due to blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and the associated elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) are some of the major causes of secondary injuries following traumatic brain injury. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is a therapeutic target for being an enzyme that degrades the proteins that make up a part of the microvascular basal lamina as well as inter-endothelial tight junctions of the blood-brain barrier. MMP-9-mediated BBB dysfunctions and the compromise of the BBB is a major pathway that leads the development of vasogenic cerebral edema, elevation of ICP, poor cerebral perfusion and brain herniation following traumatic brain injury. That makes MMP-9 an effective therapeutic target and endogenous or exogenous MMP-9 inhibitors as therapeutic drugs for preventing secondary brain damage after traumatic brain injury. Although our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the primary and secondary stages of damage following a TBI has significantly improved in recent years, such information has not yet resulted in the successful development of novel pharmacological treatment options for traumatic brain injury. Recent pre-clinical and/or clinical studies have demonstrated that there are several compounds with specific or non-specific MMP-9 inhibitory properties either directly binding and inhibiting MMP-9 or by indirectly inhibiting MMP-9, with potential as therapeutic agents for traumatic brain injury. This article reviews the efficacy of several such medications and potential agents that include endogenous and exogeneous compounds that are at various levels of research and development. MMP-9-based therapeutic drug development has enormous potential in the pharmacological treatment of cerebral edema and/or neuronal injury resulting from traumatic brain injury.",brain injury
TrkB/BDNF signaling pathway and its small molecular agonists in CNS injury.,"['YujinWang', 'JingLiang', 'BoyuXu', 'JinYang', 'ZhouruiWu', 'LimingCheng']","As one of the most prevalent neurotrophic factors in the central nervous system (CNS), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a significant role in CNS injury by binding to its specific receptor Tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB). The BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway is crucial for neuronal survival, structural changes, and plasticity. BDNF acts as an axonal growth and extension factor, a pro-survival factor, and a synaptic modulator in the CNS. BDNF also plays an important role in the maintenance and plasticity of neuronal circuits. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of BDNF in the treatment and recovery of neurodegenerative and neurotraumatic disorders. By undertaking in-depth study on the mechanism of BDNF/TrkB function, important novel therapeutic strategies for treating neuropsychiatric disorders have been discovered. In this review, we discuss the expression patterns and mechanisms of the TrkB/BDNF signaling pathway in CNS damage and introduce several intriguing small molecule TrkB receptor agonists produced over the previous several decades.",brain injury

Being male, older, having more comorbidities and living in a major city were associated with higher CQI incidence. Considerable geographical and facility variation was observed for unplanned hospitalizations and delirium CQIs.
The CQI results highlighted considerable morbidity. The CQIs tested should be considered for application in clinical quality registries to monitor dementia care quality.",brain injury

A multicentre observational retrospective study was conducted using the Emergency Department-based Injury In-depth Surveillance (EDIIS) database in South Korea. Children aged 2 to 18 years old with unpowered scooter injuries between 2011 and 2018 were eligible for inclusion in this study, and the primary outcome was TBI defined based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code.
The annual rate of unpowered scooter injuries per 1,000 injured patients increased throughout the study period from 1.4 in 2011 to 16.4 in 2018 (P for trend < 0.001). Of the 3,892 children who had unpowered scooter injuries, 353 (9.2 %) had TBI. Children were at a higher risk of unpowered scooter TBI if they were aged between 2 and 5 years (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.37; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.09-1.73), were male (aOR: 1.45; 95 % CI: 1.14-1.86), were injured either on sidewalks (aOR: 1.80; 95 % CI: 1.20-2.70) or on driveways (aOR: 2.31; 95 % CI: 1.41-3.79), and experienced a fall (aOR: 1.98; 95 % CI: 1.15-3.43). Additionally, children injured after a blunt force were at a lower risk of TBI (aOR: 0.28; 95 % CI: 0.15-0.53).
Unpowered scooter injuries in children are increasing in South Korea. It is essential for younger children riding unpowered scooters to wear helmets and for caregivers to actively supervise their children to prevent TBI.",brain injury
Neonatal di-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate exposure induces permanent alterations in secretory CRH neuron characteristics in the hypothalamus paraventricular region of adult male rats.,"['LiLi', 'YingSu', 'SiyuanWang', 'ChengyuWang', 'NaqiRuan', 'ZhiyanHu', 'XinCheng', 'JiajiaChen', 'KaimingYuan', 'PeijunLi', 'PeiFan']","Corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) play a critical role in the modulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Early-life exposure to di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) has been associated with an increased risk of developing psychiatric disorders in adulthood. The present work was designed to explore the impact of neonatal exposure to DEHP on adult PVN CRH neuronal activity. DEHP or vehicle was given to male rat pups from PND16 to PND22. Then, anxiety-like behaviors, serum corticosterone and testosterone, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, fluorescence in situ hybridization and acute ex vivo slice electrophysiological recordings were used to evaluate the influence of DEHP on adult PVN secretory CRH neurons. Neonatal DEHP-exposed rats exhibited enhanced anxiety-like behaviors in adults, with an increase in CORT.

Validation of a youth suicide risk calculator in an adult sample with bipolar disorder.,"['Jess GFiedorowicz', 'John AMerranko', 'Tina RGoldstein', 'M S WHeather Hower', 'SatishIyengar', 'Danella MHafeman', 'Jeffrey IHunt', 'MichaelStrober', 'Martin BKeller', 'Benjamin IGoldstein', 'Rasim SDiler', 'SaraSiddiqi', 'BorisBirmaher']","Bipolar disorder (BD) conveys the highest risk of suicide of all mental disorders. We sought to externally validate a risk calculator (RC) of suicide attempts developed in youth with BD from the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth (COBY) study in an adult sample.
A prospective cohort of adults with BD from the National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Depression Study (CDS; N = 427; mean (+/- SD) age at intake (36 +/- 13 years)) was secondarily analyzed to validate the COBY RC for one-year risk of suicide attempts/deaths. Nine of the ten predictor variables from the COBY RC were available in the CDS and used: age, age of mood disorder onset, first and second (partial) degree family history of suicide, history of psychotic symptoms, substance use disorder, prior suicide attempt, socioeconomic status, and non-suicidal self-injury (prospectively, incompletely at baseline).
Over a mean (SD) follow-up of 19 (10) years, 29 % of the CDS sample attempted suicide. The RC predicted suicide attempts/deaths over one-year follow-up with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78 (95 % CI 0.75-0.80). The RC performed slightly better in those with a younger age of mood disorder onset.
Clinical samples may limit generalizability; the RC does not assess more acute suicide risk.
One-year risk of suicide attempts/deaths can be predicted with acceptable accuracy in youth and adults with BD, comparable to commonly used RCs to predict cardiovascular risk. This RC may help identify higher-risk individuals with BD for personalized treatment and research. https://cobysuicideattemptsrc.shinyapps.io/Shiny.",brain injury
Role of regulatory non-coding RNAs in traumatic brain injury.,"['ShunLi', 'NaQiu', 'AndrewNi', 'Milton HHamblin', 'Ke-JieYin']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a potentially fatal health event that cannot be predicted in advance. After TBI occurs, it can have enduring consequences within both familial and social spheres. Yet, despite extensive efforts to improve medical interventions and tailor healthcare services, TBI still remains a major contributor to global disability and mortality rates. The prompt and accurate diagnosis of TBI in clinical contexts, coupled with the implementation of effective therapeutic strategies, remains an arduous challenge. However, a deeper understanding of changes in gene expression and the underlying molecular regulatory processes may alleviate this pressing issue. In recent years, the study of regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), a diverse class of RNA molecules with regulatory functions, has been a potential game changer in TBI research. Notably, the identification of microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), and other ncRNAs has revealed their potential as novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for TBI, owing to their ability to regulate the expression of numerous genes. In this review, we seek to provide a comprehensive overview of the functions of regulatory ncRNAs in TBI. We also summarize regulatory ncRNAs used for treatment in animal models, as well as miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs that served as biomarkers for TBI diagnosis and prognosis. Finally, we discuss future challenges and prospects in diagnosing and treating TBI patients in the clinical settings.",brain injury
Cerebral protective effect of in situ and remote ischemic postconditioning on ischemic stroke rat via the TGFβ1-Smad2/3 signaling pathway.,"['WeiMa', 'JinweiYang', 'JinfenZhang', 'RuiHe', 'YiLuo', 'ChunyanLi', 'FengZhao', 'FengpingTao', 'JinjinFan', 'LuweiYin', 'KeweiZhu', 'ShouruiNiu', 'LiyanLi']","Patients with acute ischemic stroke achieve inadequate benefit due to the short therapeutic window for thrombolysis and the risk of ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury. Ischemic postconditioning induces endogenous cerebral protection for acute ischemic stroke, although the protective mechanisms associated with ischemic postconditioning haven't been well clarified. In present study, the rat models of ischemic cerebral stroke with in situ and remote ischemic postconditioning (ISP and RIP) were established successfully. The Zea Longa and the modified neurological severity scoring (mNSS) were carried out to evaluate neurological function in the rats, while the open field test was explored to estimate their autonomic athletic ability. The 2,3,5-riphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining method was used to measure the size of the infarcts. TUNEL and Nissl's staining were used to detect the apoptosis rate of cells in the ischemic penumbra, with the expression of TGFβ1, Smad2, and Smad3 in the ischemic penumbra and serum detected by immunohistochemical staining, qRT-PCR, Western blots, and ELISA analysis. We showed that application of both types of ischemic postconditioning had cerebral protective effects for the ischemic stroke rats, that included effective reduction in the volume of cerebral infarction, alleviation of apoptosis and inflammation in the ischemic penumbra, and promotion of recovery of neurological function. These effects included significantly enriched gene ontology (GO) terms after RIP intervention that were related to TGFβ1, increased protein levels of TGFβ1 and decreased levels of p-Smad2/3 and smad3 following RIP intervention. We showed that the TGFβ1-Smad2/3 signaling pathway was associated with the cerebral protection of ischemic postconditioning.",brain injury
Baicalein promotes the microglia M2 polarization and suppresses apoptosis by targeting HMOX1/PDE4D to alleviate Alzheimer's disease.,"['QingmeiGong', 'YanboWang', 'XiaoweiWang', 'HaiyanPan', 'CiYan']","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that has quickly becoming one of the most expensive, lethal, and burdening diseases of this century. In the past twenty years, hundreds of drugs have been tested while only several have been authorized by FDA for AD treatment, hence, searching for candidate agent with therapeutic potential for AD is imminent. Controlling polarization direction of microglia is crucial in AD therapy. Recent research suggests that baicalein has potential to reduce neuroinflammation and prevent neurodegenerative diseases by affecting microglia, while the specific molecular mechanism of baicalein in regulating microglia in the treatment of AD is still unclear. In this study, we investigated how baicalein affected microglial polarization in AD and potential biological mechanisms. In cell experiments, it was verified that baicalein significantly shifted the BV-2 microglia phenotype from the pro-inflammatory M1 to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, inhibited the microglial apoptosis and pro-inflammatory factors, promoted the microglial Aβ uptake and anti-inflammatory factors after LPS stimulated. In APP/PS1 mice, it was found that baicalein decreased the Aβ plaque deposition in brain, attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and neuronal apoptosis in APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis and experiment validated that HMOX1 is a target of baicalein, and we elucidated that baicalein modulated the microglial polarization to inhibit neuroinflammation and neural injury through targeting on the HMOX1/PDE4D axis in AD. In conclusion, our findings indicate the therapeutic effect of baicalein for AD, and baicalein might serve a potential agent for AD treatment.",brain injury
Adolescent Sport-Related Concussion and the Associated Neurophysiological Changes: A Systematic Review.,"['Joel SBurma', 'Andrew PLapointe', 'MeganWilson', 'Linden CPenner', 'Courtney MKennedy', 'Kailey TNewel', 'Olivia AGalea', 'Lauren NMiutz', 'Jeff FDunn', 'Jonathan DSmirl']","Sport-related concussion (SRC) has been shown to induce cerebral neurophysiological deficits, quantifiable with electroencephalography (EEG). As the adolescent brain is undergoing rapid neurodevelopment, it is fundamental to understand both the short- and long-term ramifications SRC may have on neuronal functioning. The current systematic review sought to amalgamate the literature regarding both acute/subacute (≤28 days) and chronic (>28 days) effects of SRC in adolescents via EEG and the diagnostic accuracy of this tool.
The review was registered within the Prospero database (CRD42021275256). Search strategies were created and input into the PubMed database, where three authors completed all screening. Risk of bias assessments were completed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network and Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies.
A total of 128 articles were identified; however, only seven satisfied all inclusion criteria. The studies ranged from 2012 to 2021 and included sample sizes of 21 to 81 participants, albeit only ∼14% of the included athletes were females. The studies displayed low-to-high levels of bias due to the small sample sizes and preliminary nature of most investigations. Although heterogeneous methods, tasks, and analytical techniques were used, 86% of the studies found differences compared with control athletes, in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic phases of SRC. One study used raw EEG data as a diagnostic indicator demonstrating promise; however, more research and standardization are a necessity.
Collectively, the findings highlight the utility of EEG in assessing adolescent SRC; however, future studies should consider important covariates including biological sex, maturation status, and development.",brain injury
The role of spirituality and identity formation in personal recovery from traumatic brain injury: A qualitative analysis through the personal experiences of survivors.,"['JVersace', 'STazrin', ""EO'Connor"", 'JSekibo', 'EMorey', 'AKasinopoulou', ""DO'Donoghue"", 'S KSimblett']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a type of acquired brain injury (ABI) that happens when a sudden, external, physical assault damages the brain. TBI can cause long-term cognitive impairments and other lifestyle changes that may affect psychological wellbeing. Among the psychological challenges people recovering from TBI often face is the subjective loss of their pre-injury identity. Quantitative and qualitative research suggests that spirituality can play a positive role in recovery from TBI, increasing the quality of life and overall mental health. However, thus far, the research into this topic has not directly addressed the relationship between identity and spirituality after TBI. The present study sought to do this by thematically analyzing 22 public podcasts featuring interviews of people recovering from TBI telling their stories. The authors review the spiritual themes discussed in the podcasts and then propose a hypothesis about how, through a sense of connection to something self-transcendent, spirituality may enable people to test new meanings and identities, relatively free from the consequences of discrepancy in meaning and identity after TBI.",brain injury
Parent ratings of children's daily functioning in a mixed clinical sample.,"['JacobusDonders', 'JonahReibsome', 'KateWilson']","Parent questionnaires pertaining to executive and emotional/behavioral functioning are routinely included in neuropsychological evaluations to complement face-to-face cognitive tests. We evaluated in a clinical sample of 198 6-16 year-old children the degree of overlap and divergence between two common parent rating scales: the Behavior Assessment System for Children-Third Edition (BASC-3) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Second Edition (BRIEF-2). This sample was 66% male, 70% white, and included both neurological diagnoses (e.g., 33% traumatic brain injury, 12% cerebral palsy) and neurodevelopmental ones (e.g., 10% attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Inter-correlations between composite indices from the respective instruments were moderate (.41-.77). They disagreed about the presence or absence of impairment in 26% of the cases. Cluster analysis revealed four subtypes: Cluster 1 had mild externalizing and executive concerns, Cluster 2 had global emotional/behavioral and executive concerns, Cluster 3 had normal functioning, and Cluster 4 had mild internalizing and executive concerns. Clusters 2 and 3 differed in age and parental education, whereas Clusters 1 and 4 differed in Full Scale IQ. We conclude that BASC-3 and BRIEF-2 provide complementary information about a child's functioning that can inform treatment of neurobehavioral dysfunction. Elevations as well as patterns of the respective profiles on these instruments may help direct such treatment (e.g., cognitive rehabilitation, behavioral management and/or psychotherapy).",brain injury

URB937 Prevents the Development of Mechanical Allodynia in Male Rats with Trigeminal Neuralgia.,"['ChiaraDemartini', 'RosariaGreco', 'Anna MariaZanaboni', 'MiriamFrancavilla', 'SaraFacchetti', 'CristinaTassorelli']","Cannabinoids are proposed for alleviating neuropathic pain, but their use is limited by cannabimimetic side effects. The inhibition of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), the degrading enzyme of the endocannabinoid anandamide, has received attention as an alternative to cannabinoids in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Here, we investigated the effect of URB937, a blood-brain barrier impermeant FAAH inhibitor, on experimentally induced mechanical allodynia in an animal model of trigeminal neuralgia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to chronic constriction injury of the infraorbital nerve (IoN-CCI); operated animals were treated sub-chronically with URB937 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle before or after trigeminal mechanical allodynia establishment. We also assayed mRNA expression levels of the pain neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and cytokines in the medulla, cervical spinal cord, and trigeminal ganglion ipsilateral to IoN-CCI using rt-PCR. URB937 treatment prevented the development of mechanical allodynia and IoN-CCI-induced changes in mRNA expression levels of CGRP and cytokines in the evaluated areas. When administered after allodynia development, URB937 prevented IoN-CCI-induced changes in CGRP and cytokine gene expression; this was not associated with a significant abrogation of the mechanical allodynia. These findings suggest that URB937 may counteract, but not reverse, the development of allodynia in trigeminal neuralgia. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.",brain injury
PPAR Gamma Receptor: A Novel Target to Improve Morbidity in Preterm Babies.,"['SureshVictor', 'BenForbes', 'AnneGreenough', 'A DavidEdwards']","Worldwide, three-quarters of a million babies are born extremely preterm (<28 weeks gestation) with devastating outcomes: 20% die in the newborn period, a further 35% develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and 10% suffer from cerebral palsy. Pioglitazone, a Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ) agonist, may reduce the incidence of BPD and improve neurodevelopment in extreme preterm babies. Pioglitazone exerts an anti-inflammatory action mediated through Nuclear Factor-kappa B repression. PPARγ signalling is underactive in preterm babies as adiponectin remains low during the neonatal period. In newborn animal models, pioglitazone has been shown to be protective against BPD, necrotising enterocolitis, and lipopolysaccharide-induced brain injury. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of PPARγ are associated with inhibited preterm brain development and impaired neurodevelopment. Pioglitazone was well tolerated by the foetus in reproductive toxicology experiments. Bladder cancer, bone fractures, and macular oedema, seen rarely in adults, may be avoided with a short treatment course. The other effects of pioglitazone, including improved glycaemic control and lipid metabolism, may provide added benefit in the context of prematurity. Currently, there is no formulation of pioglitazone suitable for administration to preterm babies. A liquid formulation of pioglitazone needs to be developed before clinical trials. The potential benefits are likely to outweigh any anticipated safety concerns.",brain injury

COVID-19 and Kidney: The Importance of Follow-Up and Long-Term Screening.,['VikrantRai'],"Renal involvement and kidney injury are common in COVID-19 patients, and the symptoms are more severe if the patient already has renal impairment. Renal involvement in COVID-19 is multifactorial, and the renal tubule is mainly affected, along with podocyte injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inflammation, complement activation, hypercoagulation, and crosstalk between the kidney and lungs, brain, and heart are contributory factors. Kidney injury during the acute phase, termed acute kidney injury (AKI), may proceed to chronic kidney disease if the patient is discharged with renal impairment. Both AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increase mortality in COVID-19 patients. Further, COVID-19 infection in patients suffering from CKD is more severe and increases the mortality rate. Thus, it is important to address both categories of patients, either developing AKI or CKD after COVID-19 or previously having CKD, with proper management and treatment. This review discusses the pathophysiology involved in AKI and CKD in COVID-19 infection, followed by management and treatment of AKI and CKD. This is followed by a discussion of the importance of screening and treatment of CKD patients infected with COVID-19 and future perspectives to improve treatment in such patients.",brain injury

Secretome as a Tool to Treat Neurological Conditions: Are We Ready?,"['Andreia Valenteda Silva', 'InêsSerrenho', 'BeatrizAraújo', 'Alexandre MartinsCarvalho', 'GraçaBaltazar']","Due to their characteristics, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered a potential therapy for brain tissue injury or degeneration. Nevertheless, despite the promising results observed, there has been a growing interest in the use of cell-free therapies in regenerative medicine, such as the use of stem cell secretome. This review provides an in-depth compilation of data regarding the secretome composition, protocols used for its preparation, as well as existing information on the impact of secretome administration on various brain conditions, pointing out gaps and highlighting relevant findings. Moreover, due to the ability of MSCs to respond differently depending on their microenvironment, preconditioning of MSCs has been used to modulate their composition and, consequently, their therapeutic potential. The different strategies used to modulate the MSC secretome were also reviewed. Although secretome administration was effective in improving functional impairments, regeneration, neuroprotection, and reducing inflammation in brain tissue, a high variability in secretome preparation and administration was identified, compromising the transposition of preclinical data to clinical studies. Indeed, there are no reports of the use of secretome in clinical trials. Despite the existing limitations and lack of clinical data, secretome administration is a potential tool for the treatment of various diseases that impact the CNS.",brain injury
The Role of Insulin-like Growth Factor I in Mechanisms of Resilience and Vulnerability to Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.,"['Jonathan AZegarra-Valdivia', 'JaimePignatelli', 'AngelNuñez', 'IgnacioTorres Aleman']","Despite decades of intense research, disease-modifying therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still very much needed. Apart from the extensively analyzed tau and amyloid pathological cascades, two promising avenues of research that may eventually identify new druggable targets for AD are based on a better understanding of the mechanisms of resilience and vulnerability to this condition. We argue that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) activity in the brain provides a common substrate for the mechanisms of resilience and vulnerability to AD. We postulate that preserved brain IGF-I activity contributes to resilience to AD pathology as this growth factor intervenes in all the major pathological cascades considered to be involved in AD, including metabolic impairment, altered proteostasis, and inflammation, to name the three that are considered to be the most important ones. Conversely, disturbed IGF-I activity is found in many AD risk factors, such as old age, type 2 diabetes, imbalanced diet, sedentary life, sociality, stroke, stress, and low education, whereas the Apolipoprotein (Apo) E4 genotype and traumatic brain injury may also be influenced by brain IGF-I activity. Accordingly, IGF-I activity should be taken into consideration when analyzing these processes, while its preservation will predictably help prevent the progress of AD pathology. Thus, we need to define IGF-I activity in all these conditions and develop a means to preserve it. However, defining brain IGF-I activity cannot be solely based on humoral or tissue levels of this neurotrophic factor, and new functionally based assessments need to be developed.",brain injury
"Identification of CDK1, PBK, and CHEK1 as an Oncogenic Signature in Glioblastoma: A Bioinformatics Approach to Repurpose Dapagliflozin as a Therapeutic Agent.","['Harold AChinyama', 'LiWei', 'NtlotlangMokgautsi', 'BashirLawal', 'Alexander T HWu', 'Hsu-ShanHuang']","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and lethal primary brain tumor whose median survival is less than 15 months. The current treatment regimen comprising surgical resectioning, chemotherapy with Temozolomide (TMZ), and adjuvant radiotherapy does not achieve total patient cure. Stem cells' presence and GBM tumor heterogeneity increase their resistance to TMZ, hence the poor overall survival of patients. A dysregulated cell cycle in glioblastoma enhances the rapid progression of GBM by evading senescence or apoptosis through an over-expression of cyclin-dependent kinases and other protein kinases that are the cell cycle's main regulatory proteins. Herein, we identified and validated the biomarker and predictive properties of a chemoradio-resistant oncogenic signature in GBM comprising CDK1, PBK, and CHEK1 through our comprehensive in silico analysis. We found that CDK1/PBK/CHEK1 overexpression drives the cell cycle, subsequently promoting GBM tumor progression. In addition, our Kaplan-Meier survival estimates validated the poor patient survival associated with an overexpression of these genes in GBM. We used in silico molecular docking to analyze and validate our objective to repurpose Dapagliflozin against CDK1/PBK/CHEK1. Our results showed that Dapagliflozin forms putative conventional hydrogen bonds with CDK1, PBK, and CHEK1 and arrests the cell cycle with the lowest energies as Abemaciclib.",brain injury

Sex-Specific and Traumatic Brain Injury Effects on Dopamine Receptor Expression in the Hippocampus.,"['JaclynIannucci', ""KatherineO'Neill"", 'XuehuaWang', 'SanjibMukherjee', 'JunWang', 'Lee AShapiro']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health concern. Each year, over 50 million individuals worldwide suffer from TBI, and this leads to a number of acute and chronic health issues. These include affective and cognitive impairment, as well as an increased risk of alcohol and drug use. The dopaminergic system, a key component of reward circuitry, has been linked to alcohol and other substance use disorders, and previous research indicates that TBI can induce plasticity within this system. Understanding how TBI modifies the dopaminergic system may offer insights into the heightened substance use and reward-seeking behavior following TBI. The hippocampus, a critical component of the reward circuit, is responsible for encoding and integrating the spatial and salient aspects of rewarding stimuli. This study explored TBI-related changes in neuronal D2 receptor expression within the hippocampus, examining the hypothesis that sex differences exist in both baseline hippocampal D2 receptor expression and its response to TBI. Utilizing D2-expressing tdTomato transgenic male and female mice, we implemented either a sham injury or the lateral fluid percussion injury (FPI) model of TBI and subsequently performed a region-specific quantification of D2 expression in the hippocampus. The results show that male mice exhibit higher baseline hippocampal D2 expression compared to female mice. Additionally, there was a significant interaction effect between sex and injury on the expression of D2 in the hippocampus, particularly in regions of the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, TBI led to significant reductions in hippocampal D2 expression in male mice, while female mice remained mostly unaffected. These results suggest that hippocampal D2 expression varies between male and female mice, with the female dopaminergic system demonstrating less susceptibility to TBI-induced plasticity.",brain injury

Microglia are an important component of this system, which influences early neurodevelopment in addition to modulating inflammation and regenerative responses to injury and infection. Microglia are influenced by gut microbiome-derived metabolites, both as part of their normal function and potentially in pathological patterns that may induce neurodevelopmental disabilities or behavioral changes.

A Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate the Impact of an Exercise Therapy Program Based on Sports in People with Acquired Brain Injury: Discover Study Protocol.,"['AndreaGutiérrez-Suárez', 'MartaPérez-Rodríguez', 'Juan JoséGarcía-Hernández', 'BeatrizRodríguez-Romero']","Acquired brain injury (ABI) constitutes a significant and growing global public health concern. People with ABI often face a range of physical and psychosocial challenges that span the domains of ""body structure and function"", ""activity"", and ""participation"", as defined by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health. Multidisciplinary approaches based on exercise therapy with social leisure activities are essential to improve physical recovery and health-related quality of life after injury.
Adults with ABI, aged > 18 years, in the subacute or chronic stage (within more than one month after the injury) will be recruited through a rehabilitation center. Adults will be randomized to receive either a racket sports-based exercise therapy program combined with usual care (sET) or usual care alone (UC) using a random number sequence with a 1:1 allocation ratio. sET intervention consists of an 8-week exercise therapy program focusing on different racket sports skills, 1 h in duration, 2 days/week. It will be delivered by a physiotherapist in tailored, face-to-face, group-based sessions. Primary outcomes will be the health-related quality of life (SF-36) and upper extremity motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity Scale).
The study proposes an intervention that combines sports-based exercise therapy with usual care. It aims to determine whether this intervention improves the health-related quality of life and upper limb motor function in adults with ABI compared with usual care alone.

Identifying the Phenotypes of Diffuse Axonal Injury Following Traumatic Brain Injury.,"['Justin LKrieg', 'Anna VLeonard', 'Renée JTurner', 'FrancesCorrigan']","Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is a significant feature of traumatic brain injury (TBI) across all injury severities and is driven by the primary mechanical insult and secondary biochemical injury phases. Axons comprise an outer cell membrane, the axolemma which is anchored to the cytoskeletal network with spectrin tetramers and actin rings. Neurofilaments act as space-filling structural polymers that surround the central core of microtubules, which facilitate axonal transport. TBI has differential effects on these cytoskeletal components, with axons in the same white matter tract showing a range of different cytoskeletal and axolemma alterations with different patterns of temporal evolution. These require different antibodies for detection in post-mortem tissue. Here, a comprehensive discussion of the evolution of axonal injury within different cytoskeletal elements is provided, alongside the most appropriate methods of detection and their temporal profiles. Accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) as a result of disruption of axonal transport due to microtubule failure remains the most sensitive marker of axonal injury, both acutely and chronically. However, a subset of injured axons demonstrate different pathology, which cannot be detected via APP immunoreactivity, including degradation of spectrin and alterations in neurofilaments. Furthermore, recent work has highlighted the node of Ranvier and the axon initial segment as particularly vulnerable sites to axonal injury, with loss of sodium channels persisting beyond the acute phase post-injury in axons without APP pathology. Given the heterogenous response of axons to TBI, further characterization is required in the chronic phase to understand how axonal injury evolves temporally, which may help inform pharmacological interventions.",brain injury
Effect of Chronic Ankle Instability on the Biomechanical Organization of Gait Initiation: A Systematic Review.,"['MohammadYousefi', 'ShaghayeghZivari', 'EricYiou', 'TeddyCaderby']","This systematic review was conducted to provide an overview of the effects of chronic ankle instability (CAI) on the biomechanical organization of gait initiation. Gait initiation is a classical model used in the literature to investigate postural control in healthy and pathological individuals. PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched for relevant articles. Eligible studies were screened and data extracted by two independent reviewers. An evaluation of the quality of the studies was performed using the Downs and Black checklist. A total of 878 articles were found in the initial search, but only six studies met the inclusion criteria. The findings from the literature suggest that CAI affects the characteristics of gait initiation. Specifically, individuals with CAI exhibit notable differences in reaction time, the spatiotemporal parameters of anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) and step execution, ankle-foot kinematics, and muscle activation compared to healthy controls. In particular, the observed differences in APA patterns associated with gait initiation suggest the presence of supraspinal motor control alterations in individuals with CAI. These findings may provide valuable information for the rehabilitation of these patients. However, the limited evidence available calls for caution in interpreting the results and underscores the need for further research.",brain injury
Non-Invasive Systems Application in Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitation.,"['Livia LivințPopa', 'DianaChira', 'ȘtefanStrilciuc', 'Dafin FMureșanu']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant public health concern, often leading to long-lasting impairments in cognitive, motor and sensory functions. The rapid development of non-invasive systems has revolutionized the field of TBI rehabilitation by offering modern and effective interventions. This narrative review explores the application of non-invasive technologies, including electroencephalography (EEG), quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG), brain-computer interface (BCI), eye tracking, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in assessing TBI consequences, and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), low-level laser therapy (LLLT), neurofeedback, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), transcranial alternative current stimulation (tACS) and virtual reality (VR) as therapeutic approaches for TBI rehabilitation. In pursuit of advancing TBI rehabilitation, this narrative review highlights the promising potential of non-invasive technologies. We emphasize the need for future research and clinical trials to elucidate their mechanisms of action, refine treatment protocols, and ensure their widespread adoption in TBI rehabilitation settings.",brain injury
The Role of Cisternostomy and Cisternal Drainage in the Treatment of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Comprehensive Review.,"['AlbertoVandenbulcke', 'MahmoudMesserer', 'Roy TDaniel', 'GiuliaCossu']","Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) provokes a cascade reaction that is responsible for early and delayed brain injuries mediated by intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus, cerebral vasospasm (CV), and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), which result in increased morbidity and mortality. During open microsurgical repair, cisternal access is achieved essentially to gain proximal vascular control and aneurysm exposition. Cisternostomy also allows brain relaxation, removal of cisternal clots, and restoration of the CSF dynamics through the communication between the anterior and posterior circulation cisterns and the ventricular system, with the opening of the Membrane of Liliequist and lamina terminalis, respectively. Continuous postoperative CSF drainage through a cisternal drain (CD) is a valuable option for treating acute hydrocephalus and intracranial hypertension. Moreover, it efficiently removes the blood and toxic degradation products, with a potential benefit on CV, DCI, and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus. Finally, the CD is an effective pathway to administer vasoactive, fibrinolytic, and anti-oxidant agents and shows promising results in decreasing CV and DCI rates while minimizing systemic effects. We performed a comprehensive review to establish the adjuvant role of cisternostomy and CD performed in cases of direct surgical repair for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and their role in the prevention and treatment of aSAH complications.",brain injury
Walk Locomotion Kinematic Changes in a Model of Penetrating Hippocampal Injury in Male/Female Mice and Rats.,"['JonatanAlpirez', 'Lilia CarolinaLeon-Moreno', 'Irene GuadalupeAguilar-García', 'RolandoCastañeda-Arellano', 'Judith MarcelaDueñas-Jiménez', 'Cesar RodolfoAsencio-Piña', 'Sergio HoracioDueñas-Jiménez']","Traumatic brain injury has been the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in human beings. One of the most susceptible structures to this damage is the hippocampus due to cellular and synaptic loss and impaired hippocampal connectivity to the brain, brain stem, and spinal cord. Thus, hippocampal damage in rodents using a stereotaxic device could be an adequate method to study a precise lesion from CA1 to the dentate gyrus structures. We studied male and female rats and mice, analyzing hindlimb locomotion kinematics changes to compare the locomotion kinematics using the same methodology in rodents. We measure (1) the vertical hindlimb metatarsus, ankle, and knee joint vertical displacements (VD) and (2) the factor of dissimilarity (DF). The VD in intact rats in metatarsus, ankle, and knee joints differs from that in intact mice in similar joints. In rats, the vertical displacement through the step cycle changed in the left and right metatarsus, ankle, and knee joints compared to the intact group versus the lesioned group. More subtle changes were also observed in mice. DF demonstrates contrasting results when studying locomotion kinematics of mice or rats and sex-dependent differences. Thus, a precise lesion in a rodent's hippocampal structure discloses some hindlimb locomotion changes related to species and sex. Thus, we only have a qualitative comparison between murine species. In order to make a comparison with other species, we should standardize the model.",brain injury

Plant Cellulose as a Substrate for 3D Neural Stem Cell Culture.,"['Lauren JCouvrette', 'Krystal L AWalker', 'Tuan VBui', 'Andrew EPelling']","Neural stem cell (NSC)-based therapies are at the forefront of regenerative medicine strategies for various neural defects and injuries such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury. For several clinical applications, NSC therapies require biocompatible scaffolds to support cell survival and to direct differentiation. Here, we investigate decellularized plant tissue as a novel scaffold for three-dimensional (3D), in vitro culture of NSCs. Plant cellulose scaffolds were shown to support the attachment and proliferation of adult rat hippocampal neural stem cells (NSCs). Further, NSCs differentiated on the cellulose scaffold had significant increases in their expression of neuron-specific beta-III tubulin and glial fibrillary acidic protein compared to 2D culture on a polystyrene plate, indicating that the scaffold may enhance the differentiation of NSCs towards astrocytic and neuronal lineages. Our findings suggest that plant-derived cellulose scaffolds have the potential to be used in neural tissue engineering and can be harnessed to direct the differentiation of NSCs.",brain injury
LncRNAs and CircRNAs as Strategies against Pathological Conditions Caused by a Hypoxic/Anoxic State.,"['IvanAnchesi', 'GiovanniSchepici', 'EmanuelaMazzon']","Brain damage can be induced by oxygen deprivation. It is known that hypoxic or anoxic conditions can lead to changes in the expression levels of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which, in turn, can be related to Central Nervous System (CNS) injuries. Therefore, it could be useful to investigate the involvement of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), as well as the underlying mechanisms which are able to modulate them in brain damage induced by hypoxic or anoxic conditions. In this review, we focused on recent research that associates these conditions with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs). The results of this review demonstrate that the expression of both lncRNAs and circRNAs can be influenced by oxygen deprivation conditions and so they can contribute to inducing damage or providing neuroprotection by affecting specific molecular pathways. Furthermore, several experimental studies have shown that ncRNA activity can be regulated by compounds, thus also modifying their transcriptomic profile and their effects on CNS damages induced by hypoxic/anoxic events.",brain injury
Nanoparticle Formulations of Antioxidants for the Management of Oxidative Stress in Stroke: A Review.,"['SaraSalatin', 'MehdiFarhoudi', 'AfsanehFarjami', 'SolmazMaleki Dizaj', 'SiminSharifi', 'ShahriarShahi']","Stroke is currently one of the primary causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of effective stroke treatment. Therefore, novel treatment strategies are needed to decrease stroke-induced morbidity and promote the patient's quality of life. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been recognized as one of the major causes of brain injury after ischemic stroke. Antioxidant therapy seems to be an effective treatment in the management of oxidative stress relevant to inflammatory disorders like stroke. However, the in vivo efficacy of traditional anti-oxidative substances is greatly limited due to their non-specific distribution and poor localization in the disease region. In recent years, antioxidant nanoparticles (NPs) have demonstrated a clinical breakthrough for stroke treatment. Some NPs have intrinsic antioxidant properties and act as antioxidants to scavenge ROS. Moreover, NPs provide protection to the antioxidant agents/enzymes while effectively delivering them into unreachable areas like the brain. Because of their nanoscale dimensions, NPs are able to efficiently pass through the BBB, and easily reach the damaged site. Here, we discuss the challenges, recent advances, and perspectives of antioxidant NPs in stroke treatment.",brain injury
Predictive Modeling and Integrated Risk Assessment of Postoperative Mortality and Pneumonia in Traumatic Brain Injury Patients through Clustering and Machine Learning: Retrospective Study.,"['Jong-HoKim', 'Kyung-MinChung', 'Jae-JunLee', 'Hyuk-JaiChoi', 'Young-SukKwon']","This study harnessed machine learning to forecast postoperative mortality (POM) and postoperative pneumonia (PPN) among surgical traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Our analysis centered on the following key variables: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), midline brain shift (MSB), and time from injury to emergency room arrival (TIE). Additionally, we introduced innovative clustered variables to enhance predictive accuracy and risk assessment. Exploring data from 617 patients spanning 2012 to 2022, we observed that 22.9% encountered postoperative mortality, while 30.0% faced postoperative pneumonia (PPN). Sensitivity for POM and PPN prediction, before incorporating clustering, was in the ranges of 0.43-0.82 (POM) and 0.54-0.76 (PPN). Following clustering, sensitivity values were 0.47-0.76 (POM) and 0.61-0.77 (PPN). Accuracy was in the ranges of 0.67-0.76 (POM) and 0.70-0.81 (PPN) prior to clustering and 0.42-0.73 (POM) and 0.55-0.73 (PPN) after clustering. Clusters characterized by low GCS, small MSB, and short TIE exhibited a 3.2-fold higher POM risk compared to clusters with high GCS, small MSB, and short TIE. In summary, leveraging clustered variables offers a novel avenue for predicting POM and PPN in TBI patients. Assessing the amalgamated impact of GCS, MSB, and TIE characteristics provides valuable insights for clinical decision making.",brain injury

However, synaptic damage happens early in AD at the very early stages of tau accumulation. It remains unclear whether microglia activation independently causes synaptic cleavage before tau aggregation appears.
We investigated 104 participants across the AD continuum by measuring 14-3-3 zeta/delta ([Formula: see text]) as a cerebrospinal fluid biomarker for synaptic degradation, and fluid and imaging biomarkers of tau, amyloidosis, astrogliosis, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. We performed correlation analyses in cognitively unimpaired and impaired participants and used structural equation models to estimate the impact of microglia activation on synaptic injury in different disease stages.
14-3-3 [Formula: see text] was increased in participants with amyloid pathology at the early stages of tau aggregation before hippocampal volume loss was detectable. 14-3-3 [Formula: see text] correlated with amyloidosis and tau load in all participants but only with biomarkers of neurodegeneration and memory deficits in cognitively unimpaired participants. This early synaptic damage was independently mediated by sTREM2. At later disease stages, tau and astrogliosis additionally mediated synaptic loss.
Our results advertise that sTREM2 is mediating synaptic injury at the early stages of tau accumulation, underlining the importance of microglia activation for AD disease propagation.",brain injury
Resveratrol Reduces Neuroinflammation and Hippocampal Microglia Activation and Protects Against Impairment of Memory and Anxiety-Like Behavior in Experimental Cerebral Palsy.,"['Caio Matheus Santos da SilvaCalado', 'RaulManhães-de-Castro', 'Sabrinada Conceição Pereira', 'Vanessada Silva Souza', 'Leticia Nicoly FerreiraBarbosa', 'Osmar HenriqueDos Santos Junior', 'Claudia JacquesLagranha', 'Pedro Alberto RomeroJuárez', 'LuzTorner', 'OmarGuzmán-Quevedo', 'Ana ElisaToscano']","Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by motor and postural impairments. However, early brain injury can promote deleterious effects on the hippocampus, impairing memory. This study aims to investigate the effects of resveratrol treatment on memory, anxiety-like behavior, and neuroinflammation markers in rats with CP. Male Wistar rats were subjected to perinatal anoxia (P0-P1) and sensory-motor restriction (P2-P28). They were treated with resveratrol (10 mg/kg, 0.1 ml/100 g) or saline from P3-P21, being divided into four experimental groups: CS (n = 15), CR (n = 15), CPS (n = 15), and CPR (n = 15). They were evaluated in the tests of novel object recognition (NORT), T-Maze, Light-Dark Box (LDB), and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM). Compared to the CS group, the CPS group has demonstrated a reduced discrimination index on the NORT (p < 0.0001) and alternation on the T-Maze (p < 0.01). In addition, the CPS group showed an increase in permanence time on the dark side in LDB (p < 0.0001) and on the close arms of the EPM (p < 0.001). The CPR group demonstrated an increase in the object discrimination index (p < 0.001), on the alternation (p < 0.001), on the permanence time on the light side (p < 0.0001), and on the open arms (p < 0.001). The CPR group showed a reduction in gene expression of IL-6 (p = 0.0175) and TNF-α (p = 0.0007) and an increase in Creb-1 levels (p = 0.0020). The CPS group showed an increase in the activated microglia and a reduction in cell proliferation in the hippocampus, while CPR animals showed a reduction of activated microglia and an increase in cell proliferation. These results demonstrate promising effects of resveratrol in cerebral palsy behavior impairment through reduced neuroinflammation in the hippocampus.",brain injury
Pharmacokinetics of 4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde in Normal and Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Rats Based on Microdialysis Technique.,"['ChunpingXu', 'JinFeng', 'HangSun', 'MingliYan', 'QianYang', 'XiaonanZhou', 'JianguangYang', 'FangyanHe', 'QingLin']","4-Hydroxybenzaldehyde (4-HBd) is used for the treatment of headaches, dizziness, and convulsions. The objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of 4-HBd in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) rats by microdialysis technology with high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS).
Microdialysis was used to collect blood, feces, and urine of normal and CIRI model rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using HPLC-DAD and 4-HBd metabolites were determined using UPLC-MS.
After gavage of 4-HBd in normal and middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rats, it was widely distributed to all tissues (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and brain) in both the equilibrium and elimination phases, and the distribution pattern was basically the same; the highest concentration was found in the brain. The absolute bioavailability of 4-HBd was 5.33%; however, after intragastric administration in normal and MCAO/R rats, fecal and urinary excretion of 4-HBd accounted for 0.02% and 0.01% and for 0.01% and 0.03% of the dosage, respectively. Furthermore, 4-HBd was rapidly metabolized into 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA) after administration in both the control and MCAO/R groups. Compared with the control, the peak time of 4-HBd plasma concentration in the MCAO/R rats decreased from 10.67 min to 8.83 min, the area under the concentration-time curve decreased significantly, and the half-life increased from 31.81 min to 78.85 min.
The rapid absorption and low absolute bioavailability of 4-HBd by gavage in rats are followed by rapid and wide distribution to various tissues and organs, including the brain. The prototype drug is excreted in the feces and urine in low amounts, and it is metabolized to 4-HBA in large amounts in vivo; the pathological state of the MCAO/R model mainly affects its absorption degree and metabolism rate.",brain injury
"Traumatic brain injury, abnormal growth hormone secretion, and gut dysbiosis.","['Peyton AArmstrong', 'NavneetVenugopal', 'Traver JWright', 'Kathleen MRandolph', 'Richard DBatson', 'Kevin C JYuen', 'Brent EMasel', 'MelindaSheffield-Moore', 'Randall JUrban', 'Richard BPyles']","The gut microbiome has been implicated in a variety of neuropathologies with recent data suggesting direct effects of the microbiome on host metabolism, hormonal regulation, and pathophysiology. Studies have shown that gut bacteria impact host growth, partially mediated through the growth hormone (GH)/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis. However, no study to date has examined the specific role of GH on the fecal microbiome (FMB) or the changes in this relationship following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Current literature has demonstrated that TBI can lead to either temporary or sustained abnormal GH secretion (aGHS). More recent literature has suggested that gut dysbiosis may contribute to aGHS leading to long-term sequelae now known as brain injury associated fatigue and cognition (BIAFAC). The aGHS observed in some TBI patients presents with a symptom complex including profound fatigue and cognitive dysfunction that improves significantly with exogenous recombinant human GH treatment. Notably, GH treatment is not curative as fatigue and cognitive decline typically recur upon treatment cessation, indicating the need for additional studies to address the underlying mechanistic cause.",brain injury
Dorsal striatal functional connectivity and repetitive behaviour dimensions in children and youth with neurodevelopmental disorders.,"['Eun JungChoi', 'Marlee MVandewouw', 'Margot JTaylor', 'Ryan AStevenson', 'Paul DArnold', 'JessicaBrian', 'JenniferCrosbie', 'ElizabethKelley', 'XudongLiu', 'JessicaJones', 'Meng-ChuanLai', 'Russell JSchachar', 'Jason PLerch', 'EvdokiaAnagnostou']","Impairing repetitive behaviours are one of the core diagnostic symptoms in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but also manifest in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Although the dorsal striatal circuit has been implicated in repetitive behaviours, extensive heterogeneity and cross-diagnostic manifestations in these behaviours have suggested phenotypic and likely neurobiological heterogeneity across neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).
Intrinsic dorsal striatal functional connectivity in three NDDs (ASD, OCD, and ADHD) and typically developing controls (TD) were examined in a large single-cohort sample (N=412). To learn how diagnostic labels and overlapping behaviours manifest in dorsal striatal functional connectivity measured with fMRI, the main and interaction effects of diagnosis and behaviour were examined in 8 models (2 seed functional connectivity [caudate and putamen] x 4 sub-behavioural domains [sameness/ritualistic, self-injury, stereotypy, compulsions]).
The OCD group demonstrated distinctive patterns in visual and visuo-motor coordination regions compared to other diagnostic groups. Lower-order repetitive behaviours (self-injury and stereotypy) manifesting across all participants were implicated in regions involved in motor and cognitive control, although the findings did not survive multiple comparisons, suggesting heterogeneity in these behavioural domains. An interaction between self-injurious behaviour and ADHD diagnosis were observed on the caudate-cerebellum functional connectivity.
These findings confirmed high heterogeneity and overlapping behavioural manifestations in NDDs and their complex underlying neural mechanisms. A call for diagnosis-free symptom measures that can capture not only observable symptoms and severity across NDDs but also the underlying functions and motivations of such behaviours across diagnoses is needed.",brain injury
Pyroptosis in septic lung injury: Interactions with other types of cell death.,"['YiJiang', 'ShenjiaGao', 'ZhaoyuanChen', 'XiaoqiangZhao', 'JiahuiGu', 'HanWu', 'YunLiao', 'JunWang', 'WankunChen']","Sepsis is a life-threatening systemic inflammatory response syndrome caused by the host imbalanced response to infection. Lung injury is the most common complication of sepsis and one of the leading causes of patient death. Pyroptosis is a specific programmed cell death characterized by the release of inflammatory cytokines. Appropriate pyroptosis can reduce tissue damage and exert a protective effect against infection during sepsis. However, overactivated pyroptosis results in massive cell death, leading to septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and even an increased risk of secondary infection. Recent studies suggest that pyroptosis can interact with and cross-regulate other types of cell death programs to establish a complex network of cell death, which participates in the occurrence and development of septic lung injury. This review will focus on the interactions between pyroptosis and other types of cell death, including apoptosis, necroptosis, PANoptosis, NETosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis, to summarize the role of pyroptosis in sepsis-induced lung injury, and will discuss the potential therapeutic strategies of targeting pyroptosis during sepsis treatment.",brain injury

Two recent studies shed light on the temporal extent of post-stroke BBB dysfunction as well as its consequences for drug delivery. Zhang et al. found increases in BBB permeability that persist up to one-year post-ischemia. Despite increased paracellular leakage, Stanton et al. showed that transcellular transporter systems are required to deliver therapeutics into brain parenchyma. Both studies remind us of the complexity of BBB responses after stroke and provide novel entry points for future research into the underlying mechanisms.",brain injury

Questions regarding health system structures and care processes were completed by the registrar nurse reviewing the hospital records. Questions regarding patient outcomes were gathered through patient interviews.
We registered 2812 patients with TSCCI over six years from eight referral hospitals in NSCIR-IR. The median length of stay in the general hospital and intensive care unit was four and five days, respectively. During hospitalization 4.2% of patients developed pressure ulcers, 83.5% of patients reported satisfactory pain control and none had symptomatic urinary tract infections. 100%, 80%, and 90% of SCI registration centers had 24/7 access to CT scans, MRI scans, and operating rooms, respectively. Only 18.8% of patients who needed surgery underwent a surgical operation in the first 24 h after admission. In-hospital mortality rate for patients with SCI was 19.3%.

Tranexamic Acid for Traumatic Injury in the Emergency Setting: A Systematic Review and Bias-Adjusted Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"['Pieter FrancsoisFouche', 'ChristopherStein', 'MartinNichols', 'BenjaminMeadley', 'Jason CBendall', 'KarenSmith', 'DavidAnderson', 'Suhail ADoi']","Traumatic injury causes a significant number of deaths due to bleeding. Tranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, can reduce bleeding in traumatic injuries and potentially enhance outcomes. Previous reviews suggested potential TXA benefits but did not consider the latest trials.
A systematic review and bias-adjusted meta-analysis were performed to assess TXA's effectiveness in emergency traumatic injury settings by pooling estimates from randomized controlled trials. Researchers searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials comparing TXA's effects to a placebo in emergency trauma cases. The primary endpoint was 1-month mortality. The methodological quality of the trials underwent assessment using the MASTER scale, and the meta-analysis applied the quality-effects method to adjust for methodological quality.
Seven randomized controlled trials met the set criteria. This meta-analysis indicated an 11% decrease in the death risk at 1 month after TXA use (odds ratio [OR] 0.89, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84 to 0.95) with a number needed to treat of 61 to avoid 1 additional death. The meta-analysis also revealed reduced 24-hour mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.88) for TXA. No compelling evidence of increased vascular occlusive events emerged (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.27). Subgroup analyses highlighted TXA's effectiveness in general trauma versus traumatic brain injury and survival advantages when administered out-of-hospital versus inhospital.
This synthesis demonstrates that TXA use for trauma in emergencies leads to a reduction in 1-month mortality, with no significant evidence of problematic vascular occlusive events. Administering TXA in the out-of-hospital setting is associated with reduced mortality compared to inhospital administration, and less mortality with TXA in systemic trauma is noted compared with traumatic brain injury specifically.",brain injury

Notably, suppressing inflammatory pathways may reduce damage. To determine the role of neuroinflammation in the progression of neonatal brain injury, we investigated the effect of treating neonatal rat pups with the immunosuppressant tacrolimus at two time points: before and after hypoxic-ischaemic (HI)-induced injury. (2) Methods: To induce HI injury, postnatal day (PND) 10 rat pups underwent single carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia (8% oxygen, 90 min).

Raman Spectroscopy Spectral Fingerprints of Biomarkers of Traumatic Brain Injury.,"['GeorgiaHarris', 'Clarissa AStickland', 'MatthiasLim', 'PolaGoldberg Oppenheimer']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of people of all ages around the globe. TBI is notoriously hard to diagnose at the point of care, resulting in incorrect patient management, avoidable death and disability, long-term neurodegenerative complications, and increased costs. It is vital to develop timely, alternative diagnostics for TBI to assist triage and clinical decision-making, complementary to current techniques such as neuroimaging and cognitive assessment. These could deliver rapid, quantitative TBI detection, by obtaining information on biochemical changes from patient's biofluids. If available, this would reduce mis-triage, save healthcare providers costs (both over- and under-triage are expensive) and improve outcomes by guiding early management. Herein, we utilize Raman spectroscopy-based detection to profile a panel of 18 raw (human, animal, and synthetically derived) TBI-indicative biomarkers (N-acetyl-aspartic acid (NAA), Ganglioside, Glutathione (GSH), Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE), Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), Cholesterol, D-Serine, Sphingomyelin, Sulfatides, Cardiolipin, Interleukin-6 (IL-6), S100B, Galactocerebroside, Beta-D-(+)-Glucose, Myo-Inositol, Interleukin-18 (IL-18), Neurofilament Light Chain (NFL)) and their aqueous solution. The subsequently derived unique spectral reference library, exploiting four excitation lasers of 514, 633, 785, and 830 nm, will aid the development of rapid, non-destructive, and label-free spectroscopy-based neuro-diagnostic technologies. These biomolecules, released during cellular damage, provide additional means of diagnosing TBI and assessing the severity of injury. The spectroscopic temporal profiles of the studied biofluid neuro-markers are classed according to their acute, sub-acute, and chronic temporal injury phases and we have further generated detailed peak assignment tables for each brain-specific biomolecule within each injury phase. The intensity ratios of significant peaks, yielding the combined unique spectroscopic barcode for each brain-injury marker, are compared to assess variance between lasers, with the smallest variance found for UCHL1 (",brain injury
"Cumulative Incidence of All-Cause Knee Injury, Concussion, and Stress Fracture among Transgender Patients on Gender-Affirming Hormone Therapy: An Exploratory Retrospective Cohort Study.","['Emily WMiro', 'ElizaTaylor', 'AndrewCurtin', 'Michael GNewman', 'DominikOse', 'JordanKnox']","Previous research has shown a discrepancy in incidences of knee injuries, stress fractures, and concussions between cisgender men and women.

Serum biomarkers and disease progression in CT-negative mild traumatic brain injury.,"['XiaoyanJia', 'XuanLi', 'QiuyuJi', 'BoYin', 'YizhenPan', 'WenpuZhao', 'GuanghuiBai', 'JieZhang', 'LijunBai']","Blood proteins are emerging as potential biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Molecular pathology of mTBI underscores the critical roles of neuronal injury, neuroinflammation, and vascular health in disease progression. However, the temporal profile of blood biomarkers associated with the aforementioned molecular pathology after CT-negative mTBI, their diagnostic and prognostic potential, and their utility in monitoring white matter integrity and progressive brain atrophy remain unclear. Thus, we investigated serum biomarkers and neuroimaging in a longitudinal cohort, including 103 CT-negative mTBI patients and 66 matched healthy controls (HCs). Angiogenic biomarker vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) exhibited the highest area under the curve of 0.88 in identifying patients from HCs. Inflammatory biomarker interleukin-1β and neuronal cell body injury biomarker ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 were elevated in acute-stage patients and associated with deterioration of cognitive function from acute-stage to 6-12 mo post-injury period. Notably, axonal injury biomarker neurofilament light (NfL) was elevated in acute-stage patients, with higher levels associated with impaired white matter integrity in acute-stage and progressive gray and white matter atrophy from 3- to 6-12 mo post-injury period. Collectively, our findings emphasized the potential clinical value of serum biomarkers, particularly NfL and VEGF, in diagnosing mTBI and monitoring disease progression.",brain injury
Tracing the temporal trends of modifiable risk factors in dementia: insights from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (2004-2019).,"['ShanquanChen', 'HannahKuper']","Dementia's growing impact, especially in ageing societies such as the UK, emphasises the importance of modifiable risk factors as primary prevention targets. Despite this, the temporal progression and the population attributable fraction (PAF) of dementia attributable to these factors remain unclear. This investigation aims to examine the temporal trajectories of the modifiable risk factors for dementia in England from 2004 to 2019.
We used data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing collected between June, 2004, and July, 2019, covering 76 904 participants. We calculated the PAFs for 12 modifiable risk factors, as recommended by the Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention, and care, and the individual weighted PAFs (IW-PAFs) for each risk factor. We analysed temporal trends to understand the changes in the overall PAF and IW-PAF over the study period.
The overall PAF for dementia showed a decrease from 46·31% in 2004-05 to 43·95% in 2018-19, but this trend was not significant (p=0·226). Hypertension, with an average IW-PAF of 8·67%, has been the primary modifiable determinant of dementia, trailed by obesity (6·42%), social isolation (5·84%), hearing loss (5·02%), depression (4·89%), low education (4·80%), physical inactivity (3·40%), diabetes (2·61%), smoking (2·08%), excessive alcohol consumption (1·22%), air pollution (0·44%), and traumatic brain injury (0·28%). During 2004-19, only IW-PAFs of low education (p=0·001), social isolation (p=0·034), and smoking (p=0·007) showed significant decreasing trends, whereas IW-PAFs of other factors had either stagnated with insignificant changes or, worryingly, climbed upwards.
This investigation provides valuable insights into the temporal trends of modifiable risk factors for dementia in England. The observed trends underscore the continuing relevance of these risk factors and the need for targeted public health strategies to address them. Notable, PAF was based on a theoretical scenario in which dementia risk can be wholly eliminated by removing risk factors, which should be explained with caution in practice.

Rationale and design of a randomized clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of mechanical neuroprotection in reducing the risk of silent brain infarcts associated with percutaneous left atrial appendage closure: study protocol for a LAAC-SBI trial.,"['WitoldStreb', 'AnettaLasek-Bal', 'KatarzynaMitręga', 'JacekKowalczyk', 'TomaszPodolecki', 'WiktoriaKowalska', 'AnnaOlma', 'AgataSobczyk', 'ZbigniewKalarus']","Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) procedures prevent cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation who have contraindications to oral anticoagulant medications. However, these procedures carry certain risks of peri-procedural complications. One such complication is silent brain infarcts (SBI), which can lead to cognitive impairment and mood disturbances. The implementation of mechanical neuroprotection systems during LAAC procedures may reduce the risk of SBI and associated cognitive and mood disorders.
The LAAC-SBI trial is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, and double-blind interventional study. The study aims to enroll a total of 240 patients, with 120 patients allocated to each group. The study group will evaluate the use of the Sentinel CPS during LAAC, while the control group will undergo LAAC procedures without the Sentinel CPS. The primary endpoint of the study is the number of new SBIs or stroke foci detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW MRI). Secondary endpoints include deterioration of cognitive function, development of dementia syndrome, and occurrence of depressive disorders. These endpoints will be assessed using questionnaire tools such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Trail Making Test (TMT), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The observational period for patients in the study is 2 years.
If the study demonstrates a favorable outcome with reduced incidence of SBI and improved cognitive and mood outcomes in patients receiving cerebral protection devices during LAAC, it will have significant implications for clinical management standards. This would support the use of neuroprotection devices not only for LAAC but also in procedures such as atrial fibrillation ablation or transcatheter mitral valve interventions, where the risk of embolic events and subsequent brain injury may also be present.

Metabolic dynamics and prediction of sFGR and adverse fetal outcomes: a prospective longitudinal cohort study.,"['NanaHuang', 'WeiChen', 'HaiJiang', 'JingYang', 'YouzhenZhang', 'HuifengShi', 'YingWang', 'PengboYuan', 'JieQiao', 'YuanWei', 'YangyuZhao']","Selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) is an extreme complication that significantly increases the risk of perinatal mortality and long-term adverse neurological outcomes in offspring, affecting approximately 15% of monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies. The lack of longitudinal cohort studies hinders the early prediction and intervention of sFGR.
We constructed a prospective longitudinal cohort study of sFGR, and quantified 25 key metabolites in 337 samples from maternal plasma in the first, second, and third trimester and from cord plasma. In particular, our study examined fetal growth and brain injury data from ultrasonography and used the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-third edition subscale (ASQ-3) to evaluate the long-term neurocognitive behavioral development of infants aged 2-3 years. Furthermore, we correlated metabolite levels with ultrasound data, including physical development and brain injury indicators, and ASQ-3 data using Spearman's-based correlation tests. In addition, special combinations of differential metabolites were used to construct predictive models for the occurrence of sFGR and fetal brain injury.
Our findings revealed various dynamic patterns for these metabolites during pregnancy and a maximum of differential metabolites between sFGR and MCDA in the second trimester (n = 8). The combination of L-phenylalanine, L-leucine, and L-isoleucine in the second trimester, which were closely related to fetal growth indicators, was highly predictive of sFGR occurrence (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.878). The combination of L-serine, L-histidine, and L-arginine in the first trimester and creatinine in the second trimester was correlated with long-term neurocognitive behavioral development and showed the capacity to identify fetal brain injury with high accuracy (AUC: 0.94).
The performance of maternal plasma metabolites from the first and second trimester is superior to those from the third trimester and cord plasma in discerning sFGR and fetal brain injury. These metabolites may serve as useful biomarkers for early prediction and promising targets for early intervention in clinical settings.",brain injury
"Immersive virtual reality gameplay detects visuospatial atypicality, including unilateral spatial neglect, following brain injury: a pilot study.","['David RPainter', 'Michael FNorwood', 'Chelsea HMarsh', 'TrevorHine', 'DanielHarvie', 'MariliaLibera', 'JulieBernhardt', 'LeslieGan', 'HeidiZeeman']","In neurorehabilitation, problems with visuospatial attention, including unilateral spatial neglect, are prevalent and routinely assessed by pen-and-paper tests, which are limited in accuracy and sensitivity. Immersive virtual reality (VR), which motivates a much wider (more intuitive) spatial behaviour, promises new futures for identifying visuospatial atypicality in multiple measures, which reflects cognitive and motor diversity across individuals with brain injuries.
In this pilot study, we had 9 clinician controls (mean age 43 years; 4 males) and 13 neurorehabilitation inpatients (mean age 59 years; 9 males) recruited a mean of 41 days post-injury play a VR visual search game. Primary injuries included 7 stroke, 4 traumatic brain injury, 2 other acquired brain injury. Three patients were identified as having left sided neglect prior to taking part in the VR. Response accuracy, reaction time, and headset and controller raycast orientation quantified gameplay. Normative modelling identified the typical gameplay bounds, and visuospatial atypicality was defined as gameplay beyond these bounds.
The study found VR to be feasible, with only minor instances of motion sickness, positive user experiences, and satisfactory system usability. Crucially, the analytical method, which emphasized identifying 'visuospatial atypicality,' proved effective. Visuospatial atypicality was more commonly observed in patients compared to controls and was prevalent in both groups of patients-those with and without neglect.
Our research indicates that normative modelling of VR gameplay is a promising tool for identifying visuospatial atypicality after acute brain injury. This approach holds potential for a detailed examination of neglect.",brain injury

Nrf2 attenuates oxidative stress to mediate the protective effect of ciprofol against cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"['XiaLiu', 'MiaoRen', 'AnqiZhang', 'ChangshunHuang', 'JunluWang']","Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress damage are involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). Ferroptosis emerged as a new player in the regulation of lipid peroxidation processes. This study aimed at exploring the potential involvement of ciprofol on ferroptosis-associated CIRI and subsequent neurological deficits in the mouse model of transient cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Cerebral ischemia was built in male C57BL/6 J wild-type (WT) and Nrf2-knockout (Nrf2 KO) mice in the manner of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion. Ciprofol improved autonomic behavior, alleviated reactive oxygen species output and ferroptosis-induced neuronal death by nucleus transportation of NFE2 like BZIP transcription factor 2 (Nrf2) and the promotion of heme oxygenase 1 (Ho-1), solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11/xCT), and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Additionally, ciprofol improved neurological scores and reduced infarct volume, brain water content, and necrotic neurons. Cerebral blood flow in MCAO-treated mice was also improved. Furthermore, absence of Nrf2 abrogated the neuroprotective actions of ciprofol on antioxidant capacity and sensitized neurons to oxidative stress damage. In vitro, the primary-cultured cortical neurons from mice were pre-treated with oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R), followed by ciprofol administration. Ciprofol effectively reversed OGD/R-induced ferroptosis and accelerated transcription of GPX4 and xCT. In conclusion, we investigated the ciprofol-induced inhibition effect of ferroptosis-sheltered neurons from lipid preoxidation in the pathogenesis of CIRI via Nrf2-xCT-GPX4 signaling pathway.",brain injury

Celastrol Alleviates Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress and Brain Injury after Intracerebral Hemorrhage by Promoting OPA1-Dependent Mitochondrial Fusion.,"['ChunyanDiao', 'ZhengxuanYang', 'QingHu', 'PengfeiYao', 'XiaodongQu', 'ChangdongLi', 'ShenghaoZhang', 'JieZhou']","Mitochondrial oxidative stress is one of the characteristics of secondary brain injury (SBI) after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), contributing largely to the apoptosis of neurons. Celastrol, a quinone methide triterpene that possesses antioxidant and mitochondrial protective properties, has emerged as a neuroprotective agent. However, the activity of celastrol has not been tested in ICH-induced SBI. In this study, we found that celastrol could effectively alleviate neurological function deficits and reduce brain oedema and neuronal apoptosis caused by ICH. Through electron microscopy, we found that celastrol could significantly attenuate mitochondrial morphology impairment. Therefore, we tested the regulatory proteins of mitochondrial dynamics and found that celastrol could reverse the downwards trend of OPA1 expression after ICH. In view of this, by culturing OPA1-deficient primary neurons and constructing neuron-specific OPA1 conditional knockout mice, we found that the protective effects of celastrol on mitochondrial morphology and function after ICH were counteracted in the absence of OPA1. Further experiments also showed that OPA1 is indispensable for the protective effects of celastrol on ICH-induced secondary brain injury. In summary, we have demonstrated that celastrol is a potential drug for the treatment of ICH and have revealed a novel mechanism by which celastrol exerts its antioxidant effects by promoting OPA1-mediated mitochondrial fusion.",brain injury
Model matters: Differential outcomes in traumatic optic neuropathy pathophysiology between blunt and blast-wave mediated head injuries.,"['S MHetzer', ""CO'Connell"", 'VLallo', 'MRobson', 'N KEvanson']","Over 3 million people in the United States live with long-term disability because of a traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of this study was to characterize and compare two different animal models of TBI (blunt head trauma and blast TBI) to determine common and divergent characteristics of these models. With recent literature reviews noting the prevalence of visual system injury in animal models of TBI, coupled with clinical estimates of 50-75% of all TBI cases, we decided to assess commonalities, if they existed, through visual system injury. A unilateral (left directed) blast and repeat blast model injury with coup-contra-coup injury patterns were compared to a midline blunt injury. Injuries were induced in adult male mice to observe and quantify visual deficits. Retinal ganglion cell loss and axonal degeneration in the optic tract, superior colliculus, and lateral geniculate nuclei were examined to trace injury outcomes throughout major vision-associated areas. Optokinetic response, immunohistochemistry, and western blots were analyzed. Where a single blunt injury produces significant visual deficits a single blast injury appears to have less severe visual consequences. Visual deficits after repeat blasts are similar to a single blast. Single blast injury induces contralateral damage to the right optic chiasm and tract whereas bilateral injury follows a single blunt TBI. Repeat blast injuries are required to see degeneration patterns in downstream regions similar to the damage seen in a single blunt injury. This finding is further supported by amyloid precursor protein (APP) staining in injured cohorts. Blunt injured groups present with staining 1.2 mm ahead of the optic nerve, indicating axonal breakage closer to the optic chiasm. In blast groups, APP was identifiable in a bilateral pattern only in the geniculate nucleus. Evidence for unilateral neuronal degeneration in brain tissue with bilateral axonal ruptures are pivotal discoveries in this model differentiation. Analysis of the two injury models suggests that there is a significant difference in the histological outcomes dependent on injury type, though visual system injury is likely present in more cases than are currently diagnosed clinically.",brain injury

170 children with CHD and born at term who required cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in the first 6 weeks after birth were recruited from 3 European centers and underwent preoperative and postoperative brain MRIs. Uniform description of imaging findings was performed and an overall brain injury score was created, based on the sum of the worst preoperative or postoperative brain injury subscores. Motor and cognitive outcomes were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development Third Edition at 12 to 30 months of age. The relationship between brain injury score and clinical outcome was assessed using multiple linear regression analysis, adjusting for CHD severity, length of hospital stay (LOS), socioeconomic status (SES), and age at follow-up.
Neither the overall brain injury score nor any of the brain injury subscores correlated with motor or cognitive outcome. The number of preoperative white matter lesions was significantly associated with gross motor outcome after correction for multiple testing (p=0.013, β=-0.50). SES was independently associated with cognitive outcome (p<0.001, β=0.26), and LOS with motor outcome (p<0.001, β=-0.35).
Preoperative white matter lesions appear to be the most predictive MRI marker for adverse early childhood gross motor outcome in this large European cohort of infants with severe CHD. LOS as a marker of disease severity, and SES influence outcome and future intervention trials need to address these risk factors.",brain injury
"Post-traumatic hydrocephalus: An overview of classification, diagnosis, treatment, and post-treatment imaging evaluation.","['ZhaoLi', 'HanZhang', 'GuojieHu', 'GuohaiZhang']","The syndrome of post-traumatic hydrocephalus (PTH) has been recognized since Dandy's report in 1914. The pathogenesis of PTH has not been fully clarified. At present, it is believed that the obstacles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion, absorption and circulation pathways are the reasons for the development of PTH. However, recent studies have also suggested that the osmotic pressure load of CSF and the pathological changes of CSF dynamics are caused by the development of hydrocephalus. Therefore, a better understanding of the definition, classification, diagnostic criteria, treatment, and evaluation of post-treatment effects of PTH is critical for the effective prevention and treatment of PTH. In this paper, we reviewed the classification and diagnosis of PTH and focused on the treatment and the imaging evaluation of post-treatment effects of PTH.

A Narrative Review of Existing and Developing Biomarkers in Acute Traumatic Brain Injury for Potential Military Deployed Use.,"['Veronica IKocik', 'Bradley ADengler', 'Julie ARizzo', 'MargaretMa Moran', 'Adam MWillis', 'Michael DApril', 'Steven GSchauer']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in both adult civilian and military populations. Currently, diagnostic and prognostic methods are limited to imaging and clinical findings. Biomarker measurements offer a potential method to assess head injuries and help predict outcomes, which has a potential benefit to the military, particularly in the deployed setting where imaging modalities are limited. We determine how biomarkers such as ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100B, neurofilament light chain (NFL), and tau proteins can offer important information to guide the diagnosis, acute management, and prognosis of TBI, specifically in military personnel.
We performed a narrative review of peer-reviewed literature using online databases of Google Scholar and PubMed. We included articles published between 1988 and 2022.
We screened a total of 73 sources finding a total of 39 original research studies that met inclusion for this review. We found five studies that focused on GFAP, four studies that focused on UCH-L1, eight studies that focused on tau proteins, six studies that focused on NFL, and eight studies that focused on S100B.

Porous Three-Dimensional Polyurethane Scaffolds Promote Scar-Free Endogenous Regeneration After Acute Brain Hemorrhage.,"['QiaoZhang', 'JinlinChen', 'JingjingLin', 'RuichaoLiang', 'MinHe', 'YanchaoWang', 'HongTan']","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most lethal subtype of stroke and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in the clinical treatment of ICH, limited progress has been made regarding endogenous brain regeneration after ICH. Failure of brain regeneration is mainly attributed to the inhibitive regenerative microenvironment caused by secondary injury after ICH. In this study, we investigated a three-dimensional biodegradable waterborne polyurethane (BWPU) scaffold as a tool to promote brain regeneration after ICH. After implantation into the cavity following hematoma evacuation, these implanted scaffolds could act as a reservoir; store a series of necrotic debris, cytokines, and chemokines; and attract microglia/macrophages to their pores. Subsequently, these microglia/macrophages were polarized into the M1-like subtype to eliminate these substances. This process disperses M1-like immune cells and prevents the formation of dense glial scar-free structures after ICH. Inflammatory cells in scaffolds include scar-free secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and further induce a M2-like immune cells enriched regeneration-predominant microenvironment to promote endogenous brain regeneration with functional recovery. In summary, in this work, we have revealed the potential and mechanism of the BWPU scaffold as a tool to promote endogenous brain tissue regeneration after ICH.",brain injury
TRP Channels in Stroke.,"['PengyuZong', 'Cindy XLi', 'JianlinFeng', 'MaraCicchetti', 'LixiaYue']","Ischemic stroke is a devastating disease that affects millions of patients worldwide. Unfortunately, there are no effective medications for mitigating brain injury after ischemic stroke. TRP channels are evolutionally ancient biosensors that detect external stimuli as well as tissue or cellular injury. To date, many members of the TRP superfamily have been reported to contribute to ischemic brain injury, including the TRPC subfamily (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), TRPV subfamily (1, 2, 3, 4) and TRPM subfamily (2, 4, 7). These TRP channels share structural similarities but have distinct channel functions and properties. Their activation during ischemic stroke can be beneficial, detrimental, or even both.

Circ-AGTPBP1 promotes white matter injury through miR-140-3p/Pcdh17 axis role of Circ-AGTPBP1 in white matter injury.,"['ZhaokuiZhu', 'SisiMo', 'XinyuWang', 'MengMeng', 'LixingQiao']","White matter injury (WMI) resulting from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is closely associated with adverse prognoses in ICH patients. Although Circ-AGTPBP1 has been reported to exhibit high expression in the serum of premature infants with WMI, its effects and mechanisms in ICH-induced WMI remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the role of circ-AGTPBP1 in white matter injury after intracerebral hemorrhage. An intracerebral hemorrhage rat model was established by injecting autologous blood into rat left ventricles and circ-AGTPBP1 was knocked down at the ICH site using recombinant adeno-associated virus, AAV2/9. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and gait analysis were conducted to assess long-term neurobehavioral effects. Primary oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) were isolated from rats and overexpressed with circ-AGTPBP1. Downstream targets of circ-AGTPBP1 in OPCs were investigated using CircInteractome, qPCR, FISH analysis, and miRDB network. Luciferase gene assay was utilized to explore the relationship between miR-140-3p and Pcdh17 in OPCs and HEK-293T cells. Finally, CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, and flow cytometry were employed to evaluate the effects of mi-RNA-140-3p inhibitor or silencing of sh-pcd17 on the viability, proliferation, and apoptosis of OPCs. Low expression of circ-AGTPBP1 alleviates white matter injury and improves neurological functions in rats after intracerebral hemorrhage. Conversely, overexpression of circ-AGTPBP1 reduces the proliferative and migrative potential of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and promotes apoptosis. CircInteractome web tool and qPCR confirmed that circ-AGTPBP1 binds with miR-140-3p in OPCs. Additionally, miRDB network predicted Pcdh17 as a downstream target of miR-140-3p. Moreover, pcdh17 expression was increased in the brain tissue of rats with intracerebral-induced white matter injury. Furthermore, inhibiting miR-140-3p suppressed the proliferation and migration of OPCs and facilitated apoptosis through Pcdh17. Circ-AGTPBP1 promotes white matter injury through modulating the miR-140-3p/Pcdh17 axis. The study provides a new direction for developing therapeutic strategies for white matter injury.",brain injury
The Brain-Heart Axis: Neuroinflammatory Interactions in Cardiovascular Disease.,"['Jiun-RueyHu', 'AhmedAbdullah', 'Michael GNanna', 'RobertSoufer']","The role of neuroimmune modulation and inflammation in cardiovascular disease has been historically underappreciated. Physiological connections between the heart and brain, termed the heart-brain axis (HBA), are bidirectional, occur through a complex network of autonomic nerves/hormones and cytokines, and play important roles in common disorders.
At the molecular level, advances in the past two decades reveal complex crosstalk mediated by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, the renin-angiotensin aldosterone and hypothalamus-pituitary axes, microRNA, and cytokines. Afferent pathways amplify proinflammatory signals via the hypothalamus and brainstem to the periphery, promoting neurogenic inflammation. At the organ level, while stress-mediated cardiomyopathy is the prototypical disorder of the HBA, cardiac dysfunction can result from a myriad of neurologic insults including stroke and spinal injury. Atrial fibrillation is not necessarily a causative factor for cardioembolic stroke, but a manifestation of an abnormal atrial substrate, which can lead to the development of stroke independent of AF. Central and peripheral neurogenic proinflammatory factors have major roles in the HBA, manifesting as complex bi-directional relationships in common conditions such as stroke, arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy.",brain injury
"Voluntary running wheel exercise induces cognitive improvement post traumatic brain injury in mouse model through redressing aberrant excitation regulated by voltage-gated sodium channels 1.1, 1.3, and 1.6.","['DanWang', 'Hui-XiangZhang', 'Guo-JiYan', 'Hao-RanZhao', 'Xiao-HanDong', 'Ya-XinTan', 'ShanLi', 'Min-NanLu', 'RongMei', 'Li-NaLiu', 'Xu-YangWang', 'Yan-BinXiyang']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to disturbed brain discharge rhythm, elevated excitability, anxiety-like behaviors, and decreased learning and memory capabilities. Cognitive dysfunctions severely affect the quality of life and prognosis of TBI patients, requiring effective rehabilitation treatment. Evidence indicates that moderate exercise after brain injury decreases TBI-induced cognitive decline. However, the underlying mechanism remains unelucidated. Our results demonstrate that TBI causes cognitive impairment behavior abnormalities and overexpression of Nav1.1, Nav1.3 and Nav1.6 proteins inside the hippocampus of mice models. Three weeks of voluntary running wheel (RW) exercise treatments before or/and post-injury effectively redressed the aberrant changes caused by TBI. Additionally, a 10% exercise-conditioned medium helped recover cell viability, neuronal sodium current and expressions of Nav1.1, Nav1.3 and Nav1.6 proteins across cultured neurons after injury. Therefore, the results validate the neuroprotection induced by voluntary RW exercise treatment before or/and post-TBI. The RW exercise-induced improvement in cognitive behaviors and neuronal excitability could be associated with correcting the Nav1.1, Nav1.3, and Nav1.6 expression levels. The current study proves that voluntary exercise is an effective treatment strategy against TBI. The study also highlights novel potential targets for rehabilitating TBI, including the Navs proteins.",brain injury
Cross-language generalization of language treatment in multilingual people with post-stroke aphasia: A meta-analysis.,"['MiraGoral', 'Monica INorvik', 'JanAntfolk', 'IouliaAgrotou', 'MinnaLehtonen']","Studies on the efficacy of language treatment for multilingual people with post-stroke aphasia and its generalization to untreated languages have produced mixed results. We conducted a systematic review and a meta-analysis to examine within- and cross-language treatment effects and the variables that affect them. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Google Scholar (February 2020; January 2023), identifying 40 studies reporting on 1573 effect sizes from 85 individuals. We synthesized effect sizes for treatment outcomes using a multi-level model to correct for multiple observations from the same individuals. The results showed significant treatment effects, with robust within-language treatment effects and weaker cross-language treatment effects. Age of language acquisition of the treatment language predicted within-language and cross-language effects. Our results suggest that treating multilingual people with aphasia in one language may generalize to their other languages, especially following treatment in an early-acquired language and a later-learned language that became the language of immersion.",brain injury
The phosphokinase activity of IRE1ɑ prevents the oxidative stress injury through miR-25/Nox4 pathway after ICH.,"['YuhuiLiao', 'JuanHuang', 'ZhenhuaWang', 'ZhengyuYang', 'YueShu', 'ShengweiGan', 'ZhixuWang', 'WeitianLu']","Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidative stress are the major pathologies encountered after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Inositol-requiring enzyme-1 alpha (IRE1α) is the most evolutionarily conserved ER stress sensor, which plays a role in monitoring and responding to the accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins in the ER lumen. Recent studies have shown that ER stress is profoundly related to oxidative stress in physiological or pathological conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of IRE1α in oxidative stress and the potential mechanism.
A mouse model of ICH was established by autologous blood injection. The IRE1α phosphokinase inhibitor KIRA6 was administrated intranasally at 1 h after ICH, antagomiR-25 and agomiR-25 were injected intraventricularly at 24 h before ICH. Western blot analysis, RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining, hematoma volume, neurobehavioral tests, dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, H
Endogenous phosphorylated IRE1α (p-IRE1α), miR-25-3p, and Nox4 were increased in the ICH model. Administration of KIRA6 downregulated miR-25-3p expression, upregulated Nox4 expression, promoted the level of oxidative stress, increased hematoma volume, exacerbated brain edema and neurological deficits, reduced body weight, aggravated spatial learning and memory deficits, and increased anxiety levels. Then antagomiR-25 further upregulated the expression of Nox4, promoted the level of oxidative stress, increased hematoma volume, exacerbated brain edema and neurological deficits, whereas agomiR-25 reversed the effects promoted by KIRA6.

Effects of novel mRNA-VEGF@USPIO nanoparticles on human brain microvascular endothelial cell injury.,"['JiangZhao', 'ZhiyuanQian']","We investigated the effect of mRNA-VEGF@ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) nanoparticles on the repair of human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMECs) injury and its related mechanisms. mRNA-VEGF@USPIO nanoparticles were designed, prepared, and characterized using NTA and UV spectrophotometry. Cell viability was determined using the CCK-8. Cells in the control, TNF-α, and mRNA-VEGF@USPIO groups were sequenced and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Finally, a functional analysis of the DEGs was performed. Both NTA and spectrophotometry results indicated that mRNA-VEGF@USPIO was successfully constructed. TNF-α significantly reduced cell viability and promoted apoptosis compared with the control group (p < 0.05), whereas mRNA-VEGF@USPIO nanoparticles reversed the changes caused by TNF-α. Via sequencing, 9063 DEGs were identified between the control and TNF-α groups, 9125 DEGs were identified between the control and mRNA-VEGF@USPIO groups, and 211 DEGs were identified between the TNF-α and mRNA-VEGF@USPIO groups. Additionally, 71 overlapping DEGs were identified in the three groups using Venn diagrams. These overlapping DEGs were mainly enriched in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions and the TNF signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. This study shows that mRNA-VEGF@USPIO nanoparticles can repair HBMECs injury.",brain injury
How to engage patients in computerized cognitive training: a cognitive rehabilitation expert's perspective.,"['ChristelleNahas', 'MarcGandit', 'LisaQuillion-Dupré', 'EmmanuelMonfort']","The relationship between a patient and their therapist plays a crucial role in patient engagement. While Computerized Cognitive Training (CCT) may assist in preserving cognitive skills in cases of aging, dementia or acquired brain injuries, its effectiveness has not been definitively proven. Improving user engagement, acceptance, and software usability could aid in addressing this issue. The present study aims to identify potential obstacles and facilitators by examining the perspectives of rehabilitation professionals on the current usage of CCT software.
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 rehabilitation professionals, familiar with a CCT software. The data were transcribed and followed by an independent iterative thematic analysis.
Two major themes were identified: (1) facilitating factors and (2) difficulties related to use. The main obstacles were difficulties related to the computerized nature of the exercises, technology use, understanding the software and general learning difficulties. The main facilitators were the ecological and novel nature of the exercises, and the adaptability of the difficulty levels.
The complexity of the CCT presents challenges for its usage by rehabilitation professionals, which in turn can impede patient utilization as well. To address this issue and promote sustainable use of the software, providing instruction delivery to facilitate learning and understanding of the CCT is essential. Additionally, creating a standardized foundation that therapists can refer to for guidance may also aid in optimizing the software's usage. It is recommended to utilize a model for CCT acceptability and acceptance in developing these solutions to enhance patient engagement.

Proteomic analysis of Biliverdin protected cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats.,"['WenyaBai', 'SiyingHuo', 'JunjieLi', 'YuanYang', 'GuilinZhou', 'JianlinShao']","Biliverdin, a heme metabolite, has been previously reported to alleviate cerebral ischemic reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, the alterations of brain proteome profiles underlying this treatment remain elusive. The objective of this study is to analyze the differential protein expression profile in cerebral cortex of rats involved in anti-CIRI effects of Biliverdin, providing experimental foundation for searching specific marker proteins. Rat model of MCAO/R was established, HE staining, TTC staining, TUNEL staining, and neurological behavioral examination, corner turning test, adhesive removal test, were performed to validate the effects of Biliverdin, and the results indicated that Biliverdin plays a significant role in alleviating CIRI. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of brain tissues of rats subjected to CIRI following Biliverdin treatment was performed using an integrated TMT-based quantitative proteomic approach coupled with LC-MS/MS technology to clarify the comprehensive mechanisms of Biliverdin in CIRI. First, we conducted strict quality control data for TMT experiments. Finally, a total of 7366 proteins were identified, of which 95 proteins were differentially expressed (DEPs) between the CIRI group and the Sham group and 52 between the CIRI and BV groups. In addition, two overlapping proteins among the 147 DEPs, Atg4c and Camlg, were validated by RT-qPCR and western blotting, and their levels were consistent with the results of TMT analysis. Taken together, the current findings firstly mapped comprehensive proteomic changes after CIRI treated with Biliverdin, providing a foundation for developing potentially therapeutic targets of anti-CIRI of Biliverdin and clinically prognostic biomarkers of stroke.",brain injury

Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature and AgeLine were systematically searched through March 2023 to identify all randomised controlled trials of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) in patients with cognitive impairment. Corresponding authors were contacted for additional data necessary for meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria consisted of adults ≥19 years, with a diagnosis of dementia, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment or traumatic brain injury. Data were extracted in duplicate for the aforementioned primary outcomes and all outcomes were analysed using random-effects meta-analysis.
Fifty three studies (30 donepezil, 14 galantamine, 9 rivastigmine) were included providing data on 25, 399 patients. Cholinesterase inhibitors, compared to placebo, were associated with reduced risk of falls (risk ratio [RR] 0.84 [95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.73-0.96, P = 0.009]) and increased risk of syncope (RR 1.50 [95% CI = 1.02-2.21, P = 0.04]).

Commonly used methods include Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) score and the Louisville swim scale (LSS), relying on subjective observations. The CatWalk automated gait analysis system is also widely used in SCI studies, providing extensive gait parameters from footprints. However, these parameters are often used independently or combined simply without utilizing the vast amount of data provided by CatWalk. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel approach encompassing multiple CatWalk parameters for a comprehensive and objective assessment of locomotor function. In this work, we screened 208 CatWalk XT gait parameters and identified 38 suitable for assessing hindlimb motor function recovery in a rat thoracic contusion SCI model. Exploratory factor analysis was used to reveal structural relationships among these parameters. Weighted scores for Coordination effectively differentiated hindlimb motor function levels, termed as the Coordinated Function Index (CFI). CFI showed high reliability, exhibiting high correlations with BBB scores, LSS, and T2WI lesion area. Finally, we simplified CFI based on factor loadings and correlation analysis, obtaining a streamlined version with reliable assessment efficacy. In conclusion, we developed a systematic assessment indicator utilizing multiple CatWalk parameters to objectively evaluate hindlimb motor function recovery in rats after thoracic contusion SCI.",brain injury

Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scores and inclined plate tests were conducted to analyze hindlimb locomotor function. Results showed that syringaresinol could inhibit the apoptosis of glutamate-treated SHSY5Y cells by upregulating the expression of ubiquitination factor E4B (UBE4B) and activating the AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT) signaling pathway. This effect can be rescued by UBE4B knockdown or AKT pathway inhibition. Syringaresinol remarkably improved locomotor function and increased neuronal survival in SCI rats.

However, the primary cellular sources of PDGFB in the central nervous system (CNS) are unclear. Microglia is not considered a component of BBB and its role in maintaining BBB integrity in steady state is controversial. In this study, by analyzing transcriptomic data and performing in situ hybridization, we revealed a transition of the primary central PDGFB producers from endothelial cells in newborns to microglia in adults. Acute loss of microglial PDGFB profoundly impaired BBB integrity in adult but not newborn mice, and thus, adult mice deficient of microglial PDGFB could not survive from a sublethal endotoxin challenge due to rampant microhemorrhages in the CNS. In contrast, acute abrogation of endothelial PDGFB had minimal effects on the BBB of adult mice but led to a severe impairment of CNS vasculature in the neonates. Moreover, we found that microglia would respond to a variety of BBB insults by upregulating PDGFB expression. These findings underscore the physiological importance of the microglia-derived PDGFB to the BBB integrity of adult mice both in steady state and under injury.",brain injury

NEUROPLASTICITY AND BRAIN STIMULATION: DEVELOPING INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE RECOVERY FROM STROKE AND TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY.,"['HMalathi', 'LDhananjoy', 'ATarekar', 'KSharma', 'DMewara', 'DPatel J']","This article's purpose is to explore how ""non-invasive brain stimulation"" (NBS) can be used to treat ""traumatic brain injury"" (TBI) and promote neuroplasticity. Along with the pathophysiological processes that occur after a TBI, ""transcranial direct current stimulation"" (tDCS) and ""transcranial magnetic stimulation"" (TMS) are described. These processes are based on a study of the relevant literature. Individualized treatment plans are required because the pathophysiological processes that result from TBI change over time. Given their neurophysiological effects, TMS and tDCS may be used to (a) significant suppression of post-traumatic cerebral hyper excitability; (b) control synaptic plasticity over the long run to prevent unfavorable outcomes; and (c) in addition to other forms of treatment such as physical and behavioral, assist some neural networks to reorganize and consolidate their learning. These treatments have the potential to reduce the disabling symptoms of brain injury.Animal and human research show that NBS may help reduce the severity of injuries and increase plastic changes in lesioned brain tissue, both of which are necessary for the successful acquisition of new knowledge and the restoration of lost functions. However, at present, this evidence is mostly speculative. The relevance of NBS in TBI, further elucidating its therapeutic benefits, and defining appropriate stimulation levels all need investigations in TBI patients due to safety concerns.",brain injury

All correlations between subjective cognitive complaints and objective cognitive measures were not statistically significant. Hierarchical linear regression indicated that cognitive performance was not significantly related to cognitive complaints, but both PTSD diagnosis and history of deployment mild TBI explained a significant amount of unique variance in self-reported cognitive symptoms. Interactions between the studied variables were not significant.
PTSD and history of deployment mild TBI were uniquely related to cognitive complaints, but cognitive test performance was not. No confounding effects of PTSD or deployment mild TBI were observed in the relationship between cognitive performance and cognitive complaints. This provides support that symptom distress may be a better explanatory factor for perception of lower cognitive functioning than actual cognitive performance.",brain injury

The incidence of concussions following hits to the head from body checks using the shoulder, arm, and glove was similar before and following the implementation of Rule 48. However, the proportion was reduced 14.7 percentage points from 113 of 231 concussions (48.9%) before to 149 of 457 concussions (32.6%) after implementation of Rule 48 (90% CrI of the difference, 8.9-20.7 percentage points).
The findings of this cohort study of NHL players suggest that after the introduction of Rule 48, the incidence rate and proportion of concussions from contact to the lateral aspect of the head decreased, as did the proportion of concussions following direct hits to the head.",brain injury
"Moslosooflavone protects against brain injury induced by hypobaric hypoxic via suppressing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, energy metabolism disorder, and apoptosis.","['JieZhang', 'TongZhao', 'PengpengZhang', 'ZhiqunShi', 'QingyueDa', 'HuipingMa', 'LinlinJing']","To investigate the protect effect of moslosooflavone against brain injury induced by hypobaric hypoxia (HH) in mice.
Protective effects of moslosooflavone in oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, energy metabolism disorder, and apoptosis were studied in HH-induced brain damage mice. The pathological morphology in the cortex of mice was determined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The related protein expressions were detected by western blot.
Moslosooflavone improved HH-induced brain histopathological changes, reduced the contents of ROS and MDA, and elevated the levels of antioxidant enzymes and GSH in HH-exposed brains of mice. Moslosooflavone also markedly enhanced the ATPase activities and PK, ATP contents, while reducing LDH activity and the LD, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 contents HH-exposed brains of mice. In addition, moslosooflavone notably decreased the expression of HIF-1α, VEGF, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3 dramatically increasing the expression of Bcl-2, Nrf2, and HO‑1 in HH-exposed brains of mice.
Our current studies indicate that moslosooflavone protects HH-induced brain injury possibly through alleviating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, maintaining the balance of energy metabolism, and inhibiting cell apoptosis.",brain injury
NLRP3/miR-223-3p axis attenuates neuroinflammation induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia.,"['ChengWu', 'WenXing', 'YuanxiangZhang', 'JueWang', 'NaZuo', 'FuqinSun', 'QiLiu', 'ShaofengLiu']","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is mainly characterized by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) with multiple brain injuries. Nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is considered the most important factor inducing and maintaining inflammation. However, the role of NLRP3 and its underlying mechanism in CIH-elicited neuroinflammation remains unclear. We constructed an OSA-related CIH in vivo model and assessed the rats' cognitive behavior in the Morris water maze. The combination of miR-223-3p and NLRP3 was confirmed by the TargetScan database, double luciferase reporter gene experiment, and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiment. Western blot and ELISA assay were used to analyze the effects of miR-223-3p targeting NLRP3 on the expression of pyroptotic or inflammatory factors in vivo in CIH rats. Severe cognitive impairment was observed in rats at week 6 post-treatment, with increased inflammatory factors in the blood and hippocampus, heightened NLRP3 expression, and low miR-223-3p levels. And the good binding activity of the two was confirmed by dual luciferase reporter and RIP experiments. Next, we found that silencing NLRP3 or overexpression of miR-223-3p in the CIH model could improve cognitive deficits and reduce the level of proinflammatory factors and pyroptosis factors in rats. Finally, based on silencing NLRP3 or overexpression miR-223-3p, we confirmed that there was a regulatory relationship between miR-223-3p and NLRP3. Our results suggested that the NLRP3/ miR-223-3p axis played a role in attenuating CIH-induced neuroinflammation.",brain injury
Moderate-Severe TBI as a Progressive Disorder: Patterns and Predictors of Cognitive Declines in the Chronic Stages of Injury.,"['Robin E AGreen', 'Marika KDabek', 'AlanaChangoor', 'JuliaRybkina', 'Georges AMonette', 'BrendaColella']","Moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with progressive cognitive decline in the chronic injury stages in a small number of studies.
This study aimed to (i) replicate our previous findings of decline from 1 to 3+ years post-injury in a larger, non-overlapping sample and (ii) extend these findings by examining the proportion of decliners in 2 earlier time windows, and by investigating novel predictors of decline.
N = 48 patients with moderate-severe TBI underwent neuropsychological assessment at 2, 5, 12 months, and 30+ months post-injury. We employed the Reliable Change Index (RCI) to evaluate decline, stability and improvement across time and logistic regression to identify predictors of decline (demographic/cognitive reserve; injury-related).
The proportions of patients showing decline were: 12.5% (2-5 months post-injury), 17% (5-12 months post-injury), and 27% (12-30+ months post-injury). Measures of verbal retrieval were most sensitive to decline. Of the predictors, only left progressive hippocampal volume loss from 5 to 12 months post-injury significantly predicted cognitive decline from 12 to 30+ months post-injury.
Identical to our previous study, 27% of patients declined from 12 to 30+ months post-injury. Additionally, we found that the further from injury, the greater the proportion of patients declining. Importantly, earlier progressive hippocampal volume loss predicted later cognitive decline. Taken together, the findings highlight the need for ongoing research and treatment that target these deleterious mechanisms affecting patients in the chronic stages of moderate-severe TBI.",brain injury
"Knockout rates across the states as a way of predicting injury and knockout based on fighter sex, weight, or experience.","['EricTwohey', 'GeorgeVelasco', 'JohnNeidecker', 'RichardGiovane']","Combat sports, such as boxing and mixed martial arts [MMA], have the unique objective to finish a bout by way of knockout [KO] or technical knockout [TKO]. There are potentially both short- and long-term neurological injuries that can happen as a result of the repeated head trauma sustained in bouts, and thus it is imperative to identify the athletes that are at increased risk. Using an online database of professional boxing bouts [boxrec.com] over a 6-month period, KO/TKO rates were calculated across different states, weight classes, sex, and Fight Exposure Score [FES] categories. There was found to be a significant association between KO/TKO rates and weight class, sex, and FES category with heavyweights, males and FES 0 boxers having higher KO/TKO rates. KO/TKO rates were increased in winless boxers. KO/TKO rates across the states are documented in the study.",brain injury
Relations between concussion symptoms and depression among patients with mild traumatic brain injury: A moderated mediation model.,"['Ching-YuanMa', 'Ya-WenHsiao', 'Hsin-YaTzeng', 'Dueng-YuanHueng', 'Hui-HsunChiang']","Concussion symptoms following a traumatic accident are both common and known to adversely affect mental health and recovery in patients with traumatic brain injury. Depression, highly prevalent among patients with traumatic brain injury, is also associated with the important factors of sleep quality and resilience. However, the mediator and moderator roles of depression following concussion in patients with traumatic brain injury have been underexplored. The aims of this study were to investigate the mediating role of sleep quality in the relation between concussion symptoms and depression and to examine the moderating effect of resilience on this mediated model.
Cross-sectional pretest data analysis of a randomized controlled trial.
A total of 249 adult patients with mild traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale 13-15) at admission following brain injury were surveyed at a medical center in Taipei, Taiwan. The outcome variables were concussion symptoms (Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), resilience (Resilience Scale for Adults), and depression (Beck Depression Inventory II). These data were analyzed using moderated mediation regressions with the SPSS PROCESS macro.
In patients with mild traumatic brain injury, there was a significant positive relation between concussion symptoms and depression, of which sleep quality was a significant mediator. Additionally, resilience had a negative moderating effect on the relations between sleep quality and depression. Patients with less resilience showed a stronger negative effect of sleep quality on depression.
Our findings suggest that ameliorating both concussion symptoms and sleep disturbance is important for reducing the risk of depression in patients with mild traumatic brain injury, especially in those patients with less resilience.
It is essential for clinical nurses to develop interventions for patients with mild traumatic brain injury that will improve their sleep quality, while strengthening their resilience, to alleviate depression.",brain injury
"Overview of the impact of sleep monitoring on optimal performance, immune system function and injury risk reduction in athletes: A narrative review.","['HadiNobari', 'MojganBanihashemi', 'SaberSaedmocheshi', 'PabloPrieto-González', 'RafaelOliveira']","Sleep is essential for a range of physiological and mental functions in professional athletes. There is proof that athletes may experience lower quality and quantity of sleep. While adequate sleep has been shown to have restorative effects on the immune system and endocrine system, facilitate nervous system recovery and the metabolic cost of wakefulness, and play a significant role in learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity, which can affect sports recovery, injury risk reduction, and performance. Sports performance may suffer significantly from a lack of sleep, especially under maximal and long-term exercise. Due to the potential harm, these factors may do to an athlete's endocrine, metabolic, and nutritional health, sports performance is impacted by reduced sleep quality or quantity. There are several neurotransmitters associated with the sleep-wake cycle that have been discovered. They comprise cholinergic hormone, orexin, melanin, galanin, serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, histamine, and serotonin. Therefore, dietary modifications that affect the neurotransmitters in the brain also may affect sleep; particularly for athletes who require more physical and psychological recovery owing to the tremendous physiological and psychological demands placed on them during training and performance. This review explores the variables that influence the quantity and quality of sleep-in populations of athletes and assesses their possible effects. In addition, several recommendations for improving sleep are presented. Even though there has been much research on variables that impact sleep, future studies may highlight the significance of these aspects for athletes.",brain injury
DiSCIoser: unlocking recovery potential of arm sensorimotor functions after spinal cord injury by promoting activity-dependent brain plasticity by means of brain-computer interface technology: a randomized controlled trial to test efficacy.,"['EmmaColamarino', 'MatteoLorusso', 'FlorianaPichiorri', 'JleniaToppi', 'FedericaTamburella', 'GiadaSerratore', 'AngelaRiccio', 'FrancescoTomaiuolo', 'AlessandraBigioni', 'FedericoGiove', 'GiorgioScivoletto', 'FeboCincotti', 'DonatellaMattia']","Traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) results in reduced sensorimotor abilities that strongly impact on the achievement of daily living activities involving hand/arm function. Among several technology-based rehabilitative approaches, Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) which enable the modulation of electroencephalographic sensorimotor rhythms, are promising tools to promote the recovery of hand function after SCI. The ""DiSCIoser"" study proposes a BCI-supported motor imagery (MI) training to engage the sensorimotor system and thus facilitate the neuroplasticity to eventually optimize upper limb sensorimotor functional recovery in patients with SCI during the subacute phase, at the peak of brain and spinal plasticity. To this purpose, we have designed a BCI system fully compatible with a clinical setting whose efficacy in improving hand sensorimotor function outcomes in patients with traumatic cervical SCI will be assessed and compared to the hand MI training not supported by BCI.
This randomized controlled trial will include 30 participants with traumatic cervical SCI in the subacute phase randomly assigned to 2 intervention groups: the BCI-assisted hand MI training and the hand MI training not supported by BCI. Both interventions are delivered (3 weekly sessions; 12 weeks) as add-on to standard rehabilitation care. A multidimensional assessment will be performed at: randomization/pre-intervention and post-intervention. Primary outcome measure is the Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP) somatosensory sub-score. Secondary outcome measures include the motor and functional scores of the GRASSP and other clinical, neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging measures.
We expect the BCI-based intervention to promote meaningful cortical sensorimotor plasticity and eventually maximize recovery of arm functions in traumatic cervical subacute SCI. This study will generate a body of knowledge that is fundamental to drive optimization of BCI application in SCI as a top-down therapeutic intervention, thus beyond the canonical use of BCI as assistive tool.

GSK-126 Attenuates Cell Apoptosis in Ischemic Brain Injury by Modulating the EZH2-H3K27me3-Bcl2l1 Axis.,"['TaiZhou', 'LeiZhang', 'LiHe', 'YanLan', 'LeiDing', 'LiLi', 'ZhongchengWang']","Whether epigenetic modifications participate in the cell apoptosis after ischemic stroke remains unclear. Histone 3 tri-methylation at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is a histone modification that leads to gene silencing and is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Since the expression of many antiapoptotic genes is inhibited in the ischemic brains, here we aimed to offer an epigenetic solution to cell apoptosis after stroke by reversing H3K27me3 levels after ischemia. GSK-126, a specific inhibitor of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), significantly decreased H3K27me3 levels and inhibited middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) induced and oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, GSK-126 attenuated the apoptosis caused by oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and excessive inflammatory responses in vitro. The role of H3K27me3 in regulating of the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule B cell lymphoma-2 like 1 (Bcl2l1) explained the antiapoptotic effect of GSK-126. In conclusion, we found that GSK-126 could effectively protect brain cells from apoptosis after cerebral ischemia, and this role of GSK-126 is closely related to an axis that regulates Bcl2l1 expression, beginning with the regulation of EZH2-dependent H3K27me3 modification.",brain injury

Paracrine factors secreted by stem cells in vitro and delivered intranasally might allow bypassing the disadvantages associated with a surgical cell delivery procedure with likely immune rejection of a transplant. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of the extracellular vesicles secreted by glial progenitor cells (GPC-EV) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell in a traumatic brain injury model. Intranasal administration of GPC-EV to Wistar rats for 6 days improved sensorimotor functions assessed over a 14-day observation period. Beside, deep sequencing of microRNA transcriptome of GPC-EV was estimate, and was revealed 203 microRNA species that might be implicated in prevention of various brain pathologies. Modulation of microRNA pools might contribute to the observed decrease in the number of astrocytes that inhibit neurorecovery processes while enhancing neuroplasticity by decreasing phosphorylated Tau forms, preventing inflammation and apoptosis associated with secondary damage to brain tissue. The course of GPC-EV administration was promoted the increasing protein levels of NF-κB in studied areas of the rat brain, indicating NF-κB dependent mechanisms as a plausible route of neuroprotection within the damaged area. This investigation showed that GPC-EV may be representing a therapeutic approach in traumatic brain injury, though its translation into the clinic would require an additional research and development.",brain injury
"Neuropsychiatric symptoms after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury in Vietnam: Assessment, prevalence, and impact on caregivers.","['My-NganNguyen', 'RosePham', 'Tuong-VuNguyen', 'Nha-TrucLam-Nguyen', 'SkyeMcDonald', 'HalleQuang']","Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs) after moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been well documented in WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) populations. In non-WEIRD populations, such as Vietnam, however, patients with TBI clinically remain uninvestigated with potential neuropsychiatric disorders, limiting on-time critical interventions. This study aims to (1) adapt the Vietnamese Neuropsychiatric Inventory (V-NPI), (2) examine NPSs after moderate-to-severe TBI and (3) evaluate their impact on caregiver burden and well-being in Vietnam.
Caregivers of seventy-five patients with TBI completed the V-NPI, and other behavior, mood, and caregiver burden scales.
Our findings demonstrated good internal consistency, convergent validity, and structural validity of the V-NPI. Caregivers reported that 78.7% of patients with TBI had at least three symptoms and 16.0% had more than seven. Behavioral and mood symptoms were more prevalent (ranging from 44.00% to 82.67% and from 46.67% to 66.67%, respectively) and severe in the TBI group. Importantly, NPSs in patients with TBI uniquely predicted 55.95% and 33.98% of caregiver burden and psychological well-being, respectively.
This study reveals the first evidence for the presence and severity of NPSs after TBI in Vietnam, highlighting an urgent need for greater awareness and clinical assessment of these symptoms in clinical practice. The adapted V-NPI can serve as a useful tool to facilitate such assessments and interventions. In addition, given the significant impact of NPS on caregiver burden and well-being, psychosocial support for caregivers should be established.",brain injury
Adipo-glial signaling mediates metabolic adaptation in peripheral nerve regeneration.,"['Venkat KrishnanSundaram', 'VladSchütza', 'Nele HSchröter', 'AlineBackhaus', 'AnnikaBilsing', 'LisaJoneck', 'AnnaSeelbach', 'ClaraMutschler', 'Jose AGomez-Sanchez', 'ErikSchäffner', 'Eva ErnstSánchez', 'DagmarAkkermann', 'ChristinaPaul', 'NancySchwagarus', 'SilvanaMüller', 'AngelaOdle', 'GwenChilds', 'DavidEwers', 'TheresaKungl', 'MarenSitte', 'GabrielaSalinas', 'Michael WSereda', 'Klaus-ArminNave', 'Markus HSchwab', 'MarioOst', 'PeterArthur-Farraj', 'Ruth MStassart', 'RobertFledrich']","The peripheral nervous system harbors a remarkable potential to regenerate after acute nerve trauma. Full functional recovery, however, is rare and critically depends on peripheral nerve Schwann cells that orchestrate breakdown and resynthesis of myelin and, at the same time, support axonal regrowth. How Schwann cells meet the high metabolic demand required for nerve repair remains poorly understood. We here report that nerve injury induces adipocyte to glial signaling and identify the adipokine leptin as an upstream regulator of glial metabolic adaptation in regeneration. Signal integration by leptin receptors in Schwann cells ensures efficient peripheral nerve repair by adjusting injury-specific catabolic processes in regenerating nerves, including myelin autophagy and mitochondrial respiration. Our findings propose a model according to which acute nerve injury triggers a therapeutically targetable intercellular crosstalk that modulates glial metabolism to provide sufficient energy for successful nerve repair.",brain injury

Although abnormal alternative splicing (AS) has been found to be a new driving force in tumour pathogenesis and progression, the regulatory mechanisms of AS underlying the adaptation of cancer cells to harsh microenvironments remain unclear. Here, we found that hypoxia- and nutrient deprivation-induced asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) specifically cleaves DDX3X in a HIF1A-dependent manner. This cleavage yields truncated carboxyl-terminal DDX3X (tDDX3X-C), which translocates and aggregates in the nucleus. Unlike intact DDX3X, nuclear tDDX3X-C complexes with an array of splicing factors and induces AS events of many pre-mRNAs; for example, enhanced exon skipping (ES) in exon 2 of the classic tumour suppressor PRDM2 leads to a frameshift mutation of PRDM2. Intriguingly, the novel isoform ARRB1△exon13 binds to glycolytic enzymes and regulates glycolysis. By utilizing in vitro assays, glioblastoma organoids and animal models, we revealed that AEP/tDDX3X-C promotes tumour malignancy via these isoforms. More importantly, high AEP/tDDX3X-C/ARRB1△exon13 in cancerous tissues was tightly associated with poor patient prognosis. Overall, our discovery of the effect of AEP-cleaved DDX3X switching on alternative RNA splicing events identifies a new mechanism in which cancer cells adapt to oxygen/nutrient shortages and provides novel diagnostic/therapeutic targets.",brain injury

Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) for the diagnosis of delirium in adults in critical care settings.,"['FabianMiranda', 'FranciscoGonzalez', 'Maria NievesPlana', 'JavierZamora', 'Terry JQuinn', 'PamelaSeron']","Delirium is an underdiagnosed clinical syndrome typified by an acute alteration of mental state. It is an important problem in critical care and intensive care units (ICU) due to its high prevalence and its association with adverse outcomes. Delirium is a very distressing condition for patients, with a huge impact on their well-being. Diagnosis of delirium in the critical care setting is challenging. This is especially true for patients who are mechanically ventilated and are therefore unable to engage in a verbal interview. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) is a tool specifically designed to assess for delirium in the context of ICU patients, including those on mechanical ventilation. CAM-ICU can be administered by non-specialists to give a dichotomous delirium present/absent result.
To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the CAM-ICU for the diagnosis of delirium in adult patients in critical care units.
We searched MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1946 to 8 July 2022), Embase (Ovid SP, 1982 to 8 July 2022), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Knowledge, 1945 to 8 July 2022), PsycINFO (Ovid SP, 1806 to 8 July 2022), and LILACS (BIREME, 1982 to 8 July 2022). We checked the reference lists of included studies and other resources for additional potentially relevant studies. We also searched the Health Technology Assessment database, the Cochrane Library, Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility database, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, and websites of scientific associations to access any annual meetings and abstracts of conference proceedings in the field.
We included diagnostic studies enrolling adult ICU patients assessed using the CAM-ICU tool, regardless of language or publication status and reporting sufficient data on delirium diagnosis for the construction of 2 x 2 tables. Eligible studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of the CAM-ICU versus a clinical reference standard based on any iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria applied by a clinical expert.
Two review authors independently selected and collated study data. We assessed the methodological quality of studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We used two univariate fixed-effect or random-effects models to determine summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. We performed sensitivity analyses that excluded studies considered to be at high risk of bias and high concerns in applicability, due mainly to the target population included (e.g. patients with traumatic brain injury). We also investigated potential sources of heterogeneity, assessing the effect of reference standard diagnosis and proportion of patients ventilated.
We included 25 studies (2817 participants). The mean age of participants ranged from 48 to 69 years; 15 of the studies included critical care units admitting mixed populations (e.g. medical, trauma, surgery patients). The percentage of patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged from 11.8% to 100%. The prevalence of delirium in the studies included ranged from 12.5% to 83.9%. Presence of delirium was determined by the application of DSM-IV criteria in 13 out of 25 included studies. We assessed 13 studies as at low risk of bias and low applicability concerns for all QUADAS-2 domains. The most common issue of concern was flow and timing of the tests, followed by patient selection. Overall, we estimated a pooled sensitivity of 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.83) and a pooled specificity of 0.95 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.97). Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies at low risk of bias and without any applicability concerns (n = 13 studies) gave similar summary accuracy indices (sensitivity 0.80 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.86), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.97)). Subgroup analyses based on diagnostic assessment found summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for studies using DSM-IV of 0.79 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.85) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.96). For studies that used DSM-5 criteria, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.82) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99). DSM criteria had no significant effect on sensitivity (P = 0.421), but the specificity for detection of delirium was higher when DSM-5 criteria were used (P = 0.024). The relative specificity comparing DSM-5 versus DSM-IV criteria was 1.05 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.08). Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for studies recruiting < 100% of patients with mechanical ventilation were 0.81 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.85) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98). For studies that exclusively recruited patients with mechanical ventilation, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.91 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.97) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.99). Although there was a suggestion of differential performance of CAM-ICU in ventilated patients, the differences were not significant in sensitivity (P = 0.316) or in specificity (P = 0.493).
The CAM-ICU tool may have a role in the early identification of delirium, in adult patients hospitalized in intensive care units, including those on mechanical ventilation, when non-specialized, properly trained clinical personnel apply the CAM-ICU. The test is most useful for exclusion of delirium. The test may miss a proportion of patients with incident delirium, therefore in situations where detection of all delirium cases is desirable, it may be best to repeat the test or combine CAM-ICU with another assessment. Future studies should compare different screening tests proposed for bedside assessment of delirium, as this approach will reveal which tool yields superior accuracy. In addition, future studies should consider and report the flow and timing of the tests and clearly report key characteristics related to patient selection. Finally, future research should focus on the impact of CAM-ICU screening on patient outcomes.",brain injury
Fecal Incontinence after Severe Brain Injury: A Barrier to Discharge after Inpatient Rehabilitation?,"['LauraPelizzari', 'ElenaAntoniono', 'DonatellaGiraudo', 'GianlucaCiardi', 'GianfrancoLamberti']","In this study, we aimed to investigate the incidence of fecal incontinence (FI) after severe acquired brain injuries (sABIs) and to determine whether this symptom can lead to an inability to return home after rehabilitation.
This was a retrospective observational cohort study. In total, 521 acute sABI inpatients were enrolled from the Department of Neurorehabilitation at an academic tertiary care hospital. Patients were divided into two groups, with and without FI, at the end of the rehabilitation phase. The primary and secondary endpoints were the incidence of persistent FI and any difference in the discharge destination.
Upon admission, new-onset FI was found in 443 (85%) patients, of which 38% had traumatic sABI. Moreover, 62.7% of all patients had FI upon admission. At discharge, 53.3% (264/495) of patients still had FI. Of these, 75.4% (199/264) had a Rancho Level of Cognitive Functioning Scale (LCFS) ≥3. A statistically significant correlation between FI at discharge and the presence of frontal lesions, autonomic crises, and increased LCFS scores was noted. Among the patients discharged to their homes, the proportion with persistent FI was lower (34% vs. 53.3).
FI was significantly persistent after sABI, even after recovery from unconsciousness, and must be considered as a consequence of, rather than an independent risk factor for, unfavorable outcomes.",brain injury
Reporting Diagnostic Reference Levels for Paediatric Patients Undergoing Brain Computed Tomography.,"['AliAlhailiy', 'EssamAlkhybari', 'SultanAlghamdi', 'NadaFisal', 'SultanAldosari', 'SalmanAlbeshan']","Brain computed tomography (CT) is a diagnostic imaging tool routinely used to assess all paediatric neurologic disorders and other head injuries. Despite the continuous development of paediatric CT imaging, radiation exposure remains a concern. Using diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) helps to manage the radiation dose delivered to patients, allowing one to identify an unusually high dose. In this paper, we propose DRLs for paediatric brain CT examinations in Saudi clinical practices and compare the findings with those of other reported DRL studies. Data including patient and scanning protocols were collected retrospectively from three medical cities for a total of 225 paediatric patients. DRLs were derived for four different age groupings. The resulting DRL values for the dose-length product (DLP) for the age groups of newborns (0-1 year), 1-y-old (1-5 years), 5-y-old (5-10 years) and 10-y-old (10-15 years) were 404 mGy cm, 560 mGy cm, 548 mGy cm, and 742 mGy cm, respectively. The DRLs for paediatric brain CT imaging are comparable to or slightly lower than other DRLs due to the current use of dose optimisation strategies. This study emphasises the need for an international standardisation for the use of weight group categories in DRL establishment for paediatric care in order to provide a more comparable measurement of dose quantities across different hospitals globally.",brain injury
Salvianolic acid A improves nerve regeneration and repairs nerve defects in rats with brain injury by downregulating miR-212-3p-mediated SOX7.,"['ShuaiHuang', 'Hong-LiangWang']","This study was to probe the protective effects and mechanisms of salvianolic acid A (SAA) on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). The middle cerebral artery occlusion model (MCAO) was established in rats. Rats' behavior, neurological deficits, brain injury, inflammation, and apoptosis in the brain tissue were evaluated. The inflammatory response and apoptosis of PC12 cells induced by oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) were detected. SAA-mediated changes in miR-212-3p, SOX7, and Wnt/β-catenin pathway were determined, and the targeting relationship between miR-212-3p and SOX7 was clarified. SAA alleviated the neurological deficits and brain injury of MCAO rats and inhibited the inflammatory response and apoptosis of OGD/R-conditioned PC-12 cells. SAA upregulated miR-212-3p, Wnt3a, and β-catenin, whereas inhibited SOX7 levels. Silencing miR-212-3p counteracted the protective effect of SAA in the context of CIRI. SOX7 was a target protein of miR-212-3p. Silencing SOX7 based on SAA and miR-212-3p knockdown suppressed OGD/R-induced inflammation and apoptosis and increased Wnt3a and β-catenin levels in PC12 cells. SAA can improve the brain and nervous system injury caused by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion by upregulating miR-212-3p, thereby inhibiting SOX7 and activating the Wnt/βcatenin signaling pathway.",brain injury
A review of the pharmacology and clinical applications of levetiracetam in dogs and cats.,"['AliciaMastrocco', 'JenniferPrittie', 'ChadWest', 'MelissaClark']","To review and summarize the pharmacology of the antiepileptic drug (AED), levetiracetam (LEV), and to discuss its clinical utility in dogs and cats.
Veterinary and human peer-reviewed medical literature and the authors' clinical experience.
LEV is an AED with mechanisms of action distinct from those of other AEDs. In people and small animals, LEV exhibits linear kinetics, excellent oral bioavailability, and minimal drug-drug interactions. Serious side effects are rarely reported in any species. LEV use is gaining favor for treating epilepsy in small animals and may have wider clinical applications in patients with portosystemic shunts, neuroglycopenia, and traumatic brain injury. In people, LEV may improve cognitive function in patients with dementia.
LEV is a well-tolerated AED with well-documented efficacy in human patients. Although its use is becoming more common in veterinary medicine, its role as a first-line monotherapy in small animal epileptics remains to be determined. This review of the human and animal literature regarding LEV describes its role in epileptic people and animals as well as in other disease states and provides recommendations for clinical usage.",brain injury
[Clinical and imaging analysis of neurological complications in critically ill children infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron].,"['XiaoyuWang', 'XinxinQi', 'YilinZhao', 'FengWei', 'WeiguoYang', 'HongwuZeng']","To summarize clinical predictors and imaging characteristics of critically ill children infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron with neurological complications in Shenzhen during the peak of the first round of infections.
The clinical data of 11 critically ill children with neurological complications infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron in Shenzhen Children's Hospital from December 12 to 31, 2022, were retrospectively collected and analyzed. Laboratory test results related to liver parenchymal injury, histiocytic injury, inflammation, and coagulation function were collected, and imaging characteristics including CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were analyzed. The differences in CT/MRI score, acute necrotizing encephalopathy severity scale (ANE-SS) score and total score (CT/MRI score + ANE-SS score) were compared between the two groups with different prognosis during hospitation.
Among 11 children, 7 were male and 4 were female. The age ranged from 10 months to 16 years. There were 5 cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) and 6 cases of acute fulminant cerebral edema (AFCE). During hospitalization, 3 patients survived and 8 patients died of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), including 2 cases of ANE and 6 cases of AFCE. All cases had fever (> 38.5 centigrade), and 3 cases had ultra-high fever (> 41 centigrade). Within 48 hours of onset, all cases had disorders of consciousness and 9 cases had seizures. The 8 dead children had complications with multisystem involvement, including shock, respiratory failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver failure, renal failure or myocardial damage, and the laboratory predictors related to hepatocellular injury [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST)], histocyte injury [creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)], inflammation [procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum ferritin (SF)], coagulation function (D-dimer) and blood glucose (Glu) increased in different quantities, of which PCT was specifically increased in 6 cases with AFCE, PLT was specifically decreased in 3 cases with AFCE, and ALT and LDH were significantly increased in 2 cases with ANE. Imaging analysis showed subarachnoid hemorrhage, basal ganglia and thalamus lesions in all 6 cases with AFCE, while thalamus lesions in all 5 cases with ANE. The ANE-SS score of 8 deceased children ranged from 2 to 7 (of which 6 cases were ≥ 5), and the ANE-SS score of 3 surviving children ranged from 0 to 2. Eight dead children had a CT/MRI score of 1-4 (of which 6 cases were 4), and 3 surviving children had a CT/MRI score of 1-2 (of which 2 cases were 1). The total score of 8 deceased children was 6-10 (of which 6 cases ≥ 8), and 3 surviving children was 1-4.
The neurological complications of critically ill children infected with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron in Shenzhen progressed rapidly to ANE and AFCE, with high mortality. High fever (> 40 centigrade), convulsion/disturbance of consciousness, and multiple organ failure were the most common symptoms in ANE and AFCE cases. PCT increased and PLT decreased specifically in AFCE cases. Poor prognosis (death) was more common in age < 4 years old, predictors of ALT, AST, CK, LDH, PCT, D-dimer, Glu, IL-6 increased significantly, PLT decreased significantly. The common imaging feature of ANE and AFCE is the involvement of dorsal thalamus, a new imaging sign of AFCE (subarachnoid hemorrhage) was found. The higher the ANE-SS score, CT/MRI score and total score, the greater the risk of death.",brain injury
Long-term recruitment of peripheral immune cells to brain scars after a neonatal insult.,"['LukasBolini', 'Raquel Maria PereiraCampos', 'Daiane AparecidaSpiess', 'Frederico LuisLima-Rosa', 'Danillo PereiraDantas', 'LucianaConde', 'RosaliaMendez-Otero', 'Andre MVale', 'Pedro MorenoPimentel-Coelho']","Although brain scars in adults have been extensively studied, there is less data available regarding scar formation during the neonatal period, and the involvement of peripheral immune cells in this process remains unexplored in neonates. Using a murine model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and confocal microscopy, we characterized the scarring process and examined the recruitment of peripheral immune cells to cortical and hippocampal scars for up to 1 year post-insult. Regional differences in scar formation were observed, including the presence of reticular fibrotic networks in the cortex and perivascular fibrosis in the hippocampus. We identified chemokines with chronically elevated levels in both regions and demonstrated, through a parabiosis-based strategy, the recruitment of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocyte-derived macrophages to the scars several weeks after the neonatal insult. After 1 year, however, neutrophils and lymphocytes were absent from the scars. Our data indicate that peripheral immune cells are transient components of HIE-induced brain scars, opening up new possibilities for late therapeutic interventions.",brain injury
Immunonutrition with Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation in Severe TBI:  Retrospective Analysis of Patient Characteristics and Outcomes.,"['Roy APoblete', 'Jesus EPena', 'GraceKuo', 'FawazTarzi', 'Peggy LNguyen', 'Steven YCen', 'ShelbyYaceczko', 'Stan GLouie', 'Meghan RLewis', 'MatthewMartin', 'Arun PAmar', 'NersesSanossian', 'GeneSung', 'Patrick DLyden']","Background Early evidence-based medical interventions to improve patient outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) are lacking. In patients admitted to the ICU after TBI, optimization of nutrition is an emerging field of interest. Specialized enteral nutrition (EN) formulas that include immunonutrition containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) have been developed and are used for their proposed anti-inflammatory and pro-immune properties; however, their use has not been rigorously studied in human TBI populations. Methods A single-center, retrospective, descriptive observational study was conducted at LAC + USC Medical Center. Patients with severe TBI (sTBI, Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 8) who remained in the ICU for ≥ 2 weeks and received EN were identified between 2017 and 2022 using the institutional trauma registry. Those who received immunonutrition formulas containing n-3 PUFAs were compared to those who received standard, polymeric EN in regard to baseline characteristics, clinical markers of inflammation and immune function, and short-term clinical outcomes. Results A total of 151 patients with sTBI were analyzed. Those who received immunonutrition with n-3 PUFA supplementation were more likely to be male, younger, Hispanic/Latinx, and have polytrauma needing non-central nervous system surgery. No differences in clinical markers of inflammation or infection rate were found. In multivariate regression analysis, immunonutrition was associated with reduced hospital length of stay (LOS). ICU LOS was also reduced in the subgroup of patients with polytrauma and TBI. Conclusion This study identifies important differences in patient characteristics and outcomes associated with the EN formula prescribed. Study results can directly inform a prospective pragmatic study of immunonutrition with n-3 PUFA supplementation aimed to confirm the biomechanistic and clinical benefits of the intervention.",brain injury
Protocol for a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Study of Participants in the Fever Randomized Controlled Trial: Does fever control prevent brain injury in malaria?,"['Moses BChilombe', 'Karl BSeydel', 'ColleenHammond', 'SuzannaMwanza', 'Archana APatel', 'FrankLungu', 'SomweWa Somwe', 'SamKampondeni', 'Michael JPotchen', 'Michael PMcDermott', 'Gretchen LBirbeck']","Despite eradication efforts, ∼135,000 African children sustained brain injuries as a result of central nervous system (CNS) malaria in 2021. Newer antimalarial medications rapidly clear peripheral parasitemia and improve survival, but mortality remains high with no associated decline in post-malaria neurologic injury. A randomized controlled trial of aggressive antipyretic therapy with acetaminophen and ibuprofen (Fever RCT) for malarial fevers being conducted in Malawi and Zambia began enrollment in 2019. We propose to use neuroimaging in the context of the RCT to further evaluate neuroprotective effects of aggressive antipyretic therapy.
This observational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ancillary study will obtain neuroimaging and neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes in children previously enrolled in the Fever RCT at 1- and 12-months post discharge. Analysis will compare the odds of any brain injury between the aggressive antipyretic therapy and usual care groups based upon MRI structural abnormalities. For children unable to undergo imaging without deep sedation, neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes will be used to identify brain injury.
Neuroimaging is a well-established, valid proxy for neurological outcomes after brain injury in pediatric CNS malaria. This MRI ancillary study will add value to the Fever RCT by determining if treatment with aggressive antipyretic therapy is neuroprotective in CNS malaria. It may also help elucidate the underlying mechanism(s) of neuroprotection and expand upon FEVER RCT safety assessments.",brain injury
Effects of comprehensive nursing intervention on pressure ulcer after traumatic brain injury surgery: A meta-analysis.,"['Dong-HuaHuang', 'Yan-CaiXie', 'Cui-LianZhang']","Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a common complication in postoperative patients with traumatic brain injury, and this study used a meta-analysis to assess the effects of comprehensive nursing applied in PUs intervention in postoperative patients with traumatic brain injury. A computerised systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), VIP and Wanfang databases was performed to collect publicly available articles on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of comprehensive nursing interventions in postoperative patients with traumatic brain injury published up to August 2023. Two researchers independently completed the search and screening of the literature, extraction of data and quality assessment of the included literature based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Twenty-eight articles were finally included, for a cumulative count of 2641 patients, of which 1324 were in the intervention group and 1317 in the control group. The results of the meta-analysis showed that, compared with conventional nursing, comprehensive nursing intervention helped to reduce the incidence of PUs in postoperative patients with traumatic brain injury (5.14% vs. 19.67%, odds ratio [OR]: 0.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16-0.29, p < 0.00001) and reduced the incidence of postoperative complications (7.87% vs. 25.84%, OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.11-0.43, p < 0.0001), while increasing patient satisfaction (96.67% vs. 75.33%, OR: 9.5, 95% CI: 3.63-24.88, p < 0.00001). This study concludes that a comprehensive nursing intervention applied to postoperative patients with traumatic brain injury can significantly reduce the incidence of PUs and postoperative complications as well as improve nursing satisfaction, and it is recommended for clinical promotion. However, due to the limitations of the studies' number and quality, more high-quality, large-sample RCTs are needed to further validate the conclusions of this study.",brain injury
Against cortical reorganisation.,"['Tamar RMakin', 'John WKrakauer']","Neurological insults, such as congenital blindness, deafness, amputation, and stroke, often result in surprising and impressive behavioural changes. Cortical reorganisation, which refers to preserved brain tissue taking on a new functional role, is often invoked to account for these behavioural changes. Here, we revisit many of the classical animal and patient cortical remapping studies that spawned this notion of reorganisation. We highlight empirical, methodological, and conceptual problems that call this notion into doubt. We argue that appeal to the idea of reorganisation is attributable in part to the way that cortical maps are empirically derived. Specifically, cortical maps are often defined based on oversimplified assumptions of 'winner-takes-all', which in turn leads to an erroneous interpretation of what it means when these maps appear to change. Conceptually, remapping is interpreted as a circuit receiving novel input and processing it in a way unrelated to its original function. This implies that neurons are either pluripotent enough to change what they are tuned to or that a circuit can change what it computes. Instead of reorganisation, we argue that remapping is more likely to occur due to potentiation of pre-existing architecture that already has the requisite representational and computational capacity pre-injury. This architecture can be facilitated via Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. Crucially, our revised framework proposes that opportunities for functional change are constrained throughout the lifespan by the underlying structural 'blueprint'. At no period, including early in development, does the cortex offer structural opportunities for functional pluripotency. We conclude that reorganisation as a distinct form of cortical plasticity, ubiquitously evoked with words such as 'take-over'' and 'rewiring', does not exist.",brain injury
Vascular endothelial growth factor-D plasma levels in fluid overload and cardiac function evaluation of elderly patients with cardiovascular disease.,"['JunLi', 'Xiao-LinLi', 'Fa-HuLiu', 'Ya-FenYu', 'YuanDu']","This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) subtypes and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) plasma levels in evaluating the fluid overload and cardiac function of elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. The plasma levels of VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and GDF-15 were measured using ELISA. Their correlations with N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro BNP) and echocardiography data were analyzed. 1. Higher plasma levels of VEGF-D and GDF-15 were observed in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease and heart failure(P < .01). VEGF-D plasma levels were higher in patients with chronic heart failure than those with acute myocardial infarction (P < .01). VEGF-D plasma levels were positively correlated with amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) (P < .001). VEGF-D plasma levels were positively correlated with echocardiographic parameters, including left atrial diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction, in patients with cardiovascular disease (P < .01). 2. VEGF-C plasma levels were higher in acute myocardial infarction group (P < .05). The plasma levels of VEGF-C were not correlated with either VEGF-D or NT-pro BNP plasma levels. VEGF-C plasma levels had no correlation with echocardiographic parameters. 3. GDF-15 plasma levels were positively correlated with sera biomarkers of cardiac injury (creatine kinase isoenzyme MB and cardiac troponin I). GDF-15 plasma levels were positively correlated with urinary biomarkers of tubular injury (N-acetyl-β-galactosidase and α1-microglobulin). Both GDF-15 and NT-pro BNP plasma levels were correlated with age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and nutritional biomarkers (albumin and hemoglobin plasma levels). VEGF-D plasma levels is a potential biomarker of fluid overload and cardiac function in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. Age, nutrition, and kidney injury are factors influencing both GDF-15 and NT-pro BNP plasma levels in estimating cardiac function and fluid overload.",brain injury
The role of JAK/STAT signaling pathway in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury and the therapeutic effect of traditional Chinese medicine: A narrative review.,"['TianzhiSong', 'YishuZhang', 'LiangrongZhu', 'YuyanZhang', 'JingmeiSong']","Cerebral ischemia is a cerebrovascular disease with symptoms caused by insufficient blood or oxygen supply to the brain. When blood supplied is restored after cerebral ischemia, secondary brain injury may occur, which is called cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI). In this process, the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway plays an important role. It mediates neuroinflammation and participates in the regulation of physiological activities, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. After CIRI, M1 microglia is activated and recruited by the damaged tissue. The inflammatory factors are produced by M1 microglia through the JAK/STAT pathway, eventually leading to cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and the expression of lipocalin-2 and caspase-3 could increase. In the pathway, phosphorylated JAK2 and phosphorylated STAT3 function of 2 ways. They not only promote the proliferation of neurons, but also affect the differentiation direction of neural stem cells by further acting on the Notch signaling pathway. Recently, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a key player in CIRI, through JAK2, STAT3, STAT1 and their phosphorylation. Therefore, the review focuses on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and its relationship with CIRI as well as the influence of the TCM on this pathway. It is aimed at providing the basis for future clinical research on the molecular mechanism of TCM in the treatment of CIRI.",brain injury
Epidemiology of head injuries in pedestrian-motor vehicle accidents.,"['BehzadZohrevandi', 'Enayatollah HomaieRad', 'LeilaKouchakinejad-Eramsadati', 'GhazalehImani', 'ImanPourheravi', 'NaemaKhodadadi-Hassankiadeh']","Despite efforts of many countries to improve pedestrian safety, international reports show an upward trend in pedestrian-motor vehicle accidents. Although the most common cause of death of pedestrians is head injuries, there is a lack of knowledge on the epidemiology and characteristics of head injury in terms of the Glasgow Outcome Scale to be used for prevention. However, this study aimed to determine the epidemiology of pedestrian-motor vehicle accidents, the characteristics of head injury, and differences in the Glasgow Outcome Scale in terms of gender. In this retrospective analytical study, the data of 917 eligible injured pedestrians were obtained from the two databases of the Trauma System and the Hospital Information System. The data were analyzed using SPSS software (Version 21). The mean age of all 917 injured pedestrians was 47.55 ± 19.47 years. Most of the injured pedestrians (42.10%) were in the age range of 41-69 years and 81.31% were male. Moreover, 83.07% did not have any acute lesions on the CT scan. The most common brain lesion was brain contusion (n = 33, 3.60%), subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 33, 3.60%), and skull fracture (n = 29, 3.16%). Among all concurrent injuries, lower extremity/pelvic injuries were observed in 216 patients (23.56%). Outpatient treatment (n = 782, 85.27%), airway control/endotracheal intubation (n = 57, 6.22%), and resuscitation (n = 35, 3.82%) were the most applied treatments respectively. There were significant differences in the Glasgow Outcome Scale between men and women (P- value = 0. 012). The high rate of mortalities, disability, head injuries, contusion, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and skull fractures in pedestrians involved in MVAs emphasizes the need for developing and implementing prevention strategies including appropriate management and risk reduction. Male pedestrians were at higher risk of motor vehicle accidents and worse Glasgow Outcome Scale. The presented data identified the main types of pedestrian injuries and suggested the importance of adopting appropriate preventive strategies to achieve the most effective interventions for creating a safer community.",brain injury

Acquiring an injury to the brain or spinal cord constitutes a severe life change for the entire family and therefore a family-centered approach in neurorehabilitation is crucial.As individuals with injury and their family members often feel disconnected during rehabilitation, healthcare professionals play a significant role in facilitating the family to share their experiences with each other to strengthen family cohesion.Not all families are aware of their need for support. Thus, healthcare professionals should pay particular attention to identify the individual family’s needs for being supported.During conversations with families, healthcare professionals should focus on the balance between separateness and togetherness in the family system to support the families in achieving a balanced level of family cohesion.",brain injury
Terminology and methods used to differentiate injury intent of hospital burn patients in South Asia: Results from a systematic scoping review.,"['EmilyBebbington', 'ParvathyRamesh', 'RebeccaMcPhillips', 'FatimaBibi', 'MuradKhan', 'MohanKakola', 'RobPoole', 'CatherineRobinson']","A key component in the classification of all injury types is to differentiate whether the injury was deliberately inflicted and by whom, commonly known as ""intent"" in the surveillance literature. These data guide patient care and inform surveillance strategies. South Asia is believed to have the greatest number of intentional burn injuries, but national surveillance data is not disaggregated by injury intent. Scientific literature can be used for injury surveillance where national data collection does not exist. In order to synthesise research findings, it is essential to assess the potential impact of misclassification bias. We therefore conducted a systematic scoping review to understand terminology and methods used to differentiate injury intent of hospital burn patients in South Asia.
We followed the methods in our registered protocol (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/DCYNQ). Studies met defined population, concept, context, and study design criteria. The databases Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and PakMediNet were searched. Two reviewers independently screened results. Data were extracted in a standardised manner and verified. The rigour of the method used to differentiate injury intent was appraised.
1435 articles were screened. Of these, 89 met our inclusion criteria. Most articles were from India and Pakistan, and used an observational study design. There were 14 stem terms used in the articles. The most common was ""cause"". There were 40 classifier terms. The most common were ""accident"", ""suicide"", and ""homicide"". Few articles defined these terms. The method used to differentiate injury intent was only described explicitly in 17% of articles and the rigour of the methods used were low. Where methods of differentiation were described, they appear to be based on patient or family report rather than multidisciplinary assessment.
The heterogeneity in terms, lack of definitions, and limited investigation of injury intent means this variable is likely to be prone to misclassification bias. We strongly recommend that the global burn community unites to develop a common data element, including definitions and methods of assessment, for the concept of burn injury intent to enable more reliable data collection practices and interstudy comparisons.",brain injury
Alzheimer's disease-related brain insulin resistance and the prospective therapeutic impact of metformin.,"['Hamed AAbosharaf', 'YasminElsonbaty', 'EhabTousson', 'TarekM Mohamed']","Besides COVID-19, two of the most critical outbreaks of our day are insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Each disease's pathophysiology is well established. Furthermore, a substantial overlap between them has coexisted. Uncertainty remains on whether T2DM and AD are parallel illnesses with the same origin or separate illnesses linked through violent pathways. The current study was aimed at testing whether the insulin resistance in the brain results in AD symptoms or not. Insulin resistance was induced in the brains of rats using a single intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ) dose. We then measured glucose, insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, and tau phosphorylation in the brain to look for signs of insulin resistance and AD. The results of this study indicated that a single dose of STZ was able to induce insulin resistance in the brain and significantly decline IRS-2. This resistance was accompanied by obvious memory loss, Aβ deposition, and tau phosphorylation, further visible diminishing in neurotransmitters such as dopamine and acetylcholine. Furthermore, oxidative stress was increased due to the antioxidant system being compromised. Interestingly, the pancreas injury and peripheral insulin resistance coexisted with brain insulin resistance. Indeed, the antidiabetic metformin was able to enhance all these drastic effects. In conclusion, brain insulin resistance could lead to AD and vice versa. These are highly linked syndromes that could influence peripheral organs. Further studies are required to stabilize this putative pathobiology relationship between them.",brain injury
Differences in injury and concussion rates in a cohort of Canadian female and male youth Rugby Union: a step towards targeted prevention strategies.,"['Isla JShill', 'Stephen WWest', 'StacySick', 'Kathryn JSchneider', 'J PrestonWiley', 'Brent EHagel', 'Amanda MBlack', 'Carolyn AEmery']","To examine differences in match and training musculoskeletal injury and concussion rates and describe mechanisms of concussion while considering previous playing experience in female and male Canadian high school Rugby Union ('rugby') players.
A 2-year prospective cohort study was completed in a high school league (n=361 females, 421 player-seasons; n=429 males, 481 player-seasons) in Calgary, Canada over the 2018 and 2019 rugby playing seasons. Baseline testing was completed at the start of each season and injury surveillance and individual player participation through session attendance was documented to quantify individual-level player exposure hours. Injury incidence rates (IRs) and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated using Poisson regression, offset by player exposure hours and clustered by team.
Overall match IR for females was 62% higher than males (overall IRR=1.62, 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.18) and the overall training IR was twice as high for females (overall IRR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.40 to 3.32). The female match concussion IR was 70% higher than the males (concussion IRR=1.70, 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.69). Females had a 75% greater tackle-related IR compared with males (IRR=1.75, 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.56). Additionally, female tacklers had a twofold greater rate of injury compared with male tacklers (IRR
The rate of injury and concussion was significantly higher in females within this Canadian high school cohort. These results emphasise the need for development, implementation and evaluation of female-specific injury and concussion prevention strategies to reduce injury and concussion in female youth rugby.",brain injury
Electroacupuncture alleviates neurological function via activating the Yap-OPA1 axis and mitochondrial fusion in rats with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"['HuiLiang', 'SuRuan', 'FangWang', 'Nian-WenYan', 'Yan-XuWang', 'BinChen', 'JingLuo', 'Jia-JingLiu', 'Xiao-YongZhong']","To investigate the mechanism of electroacupuncture (EA) in alleviating cerebral ische-mia injury by activating the Yap-OPA1 signaling axis.

According to a recent study, targeting ferroptosis might be effective in the management of IS and HS. However, the ferroptosis-related effects and mechanisms of AGNHW have not yet been reported.
This research examines the anti-ferroptosis mechanisms of AGNHW in the treatment of IS and HS.
A system pharmacological approach including in vivo experiment, UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS, network pharmacology, molecular docking, microscale thermophoresis, and in vitro experiment was utilized to study the anti-ferroptosis mechanisms of AGNHW against IS and HS.
In vivo experiments indicated that AGNHW enhanced nerve function, decreased cerebral infarct volume, ameliorated histological brain injuries, improved the structural integrity of the blood-brain barrier, ameliorated the mitochondrial dysfunction and morphology disruption, and inhibits ROS, LPO and Fe
AGNHW attenuated ferroptosis in treating IS and HS by targeting the PPARγ/AKT/GPX4 pathway.

Myelination of preterm brain networks at adolescence.,"['BeatrizLaureano', 'HassnaIrzan', ""HelenO'Reilly"", 'SebastianOurselin', 'NeilMarlow', 'AndrewMelbourne']","Prematurity and preterm stressors severely affect the development of infants born before 37 weeks of gestation, with increasing effects seen at earlier gestations. Although preterm mortality rates have declined due to the advances in neonatal care, disability rates, especially in middle-income settings, continue to grow. With the advances in MR imaging technology, there has been a focus on safely imaging the preterm brain to better understand its development and discover the brain regions and networks affected by prematurity. Such studies aim to support interventions and improve the neurodevelopment of preterm infants and deliver accurate prognoses. Few studies, however, have focused on the fully developed brain of preterm born infants, especially in extremely preterm subjects. To assess the long-term effect of prematurity on the adult brain, myelin related biomarkers such as myelin water fraction and g-ratio are measured for a cohort of 19-year-old extremely preterm born subjects. Using multi-modal imaging techniques that combine T2 relaxometry and neurite density information, the results show that specific brain regions associated with white matter injuries due to preterm birth, such as the posterior limb of the internal capsule and corpus callosum, are still less myelinated in adulthood. Furthermore, a weak positive relationship between myelin water fraction values and Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) scores was found in multiple brain regions previously defined as less myelinated in the Extremely Preterm (EPT) cohort. These findings might suggest altered connectivity in the adult preterm brain and explain differences in cognitive outcomes.",brain injury

We sought to determine the variables associated with either surgical approach and to compare outcomes between matched patients.
A multi-center retrospective review was used to identify traumatic aSDH patients who underwent CO or DC. Patient variables independently associated with surgical approach were used for coarsened exact matching.Multivariate logistic regression and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression wereconducted on matched patients to determine independent predictors of mortality.
Seventy-six patients underwent CO and sixty-two underwent DC for aSDH evacuation. DC patients were21.4 years younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be male (80.6 % vs 60.5 %,P = 0.011), and present with GCS ≤ 8 (64.5 % vs 36.8 %,P = 0.001).

A Qualitative Study of Veterans' Perspectives on Tinnitus: An Invisible Wound.,"['Khaya DClark', 'LauraCoco', 'TaraZaugg', 'SusanDeFrancesco', 'ChristineKaelin', 'James AHenry', 'Kathleen FCarlson']","Tinnitus is highly prevalent among U.S. military Veterans, yet referral to, and use of, tinnitus rehabilitation services to improve quality of life and functional status with tinnitus is low. Veterans with tinnitus often have other health issues that overlap or exacerbate the impact of tinnitus, potentially complicating referral and rehabilitative pathways. This qualitative study explores views on the daily impacts of tinnitus and experiences with tinnitus-related health care among Veterans. The goal of this research is to amplify the voices of Veterans regarding their experiences with tinnitus to illuminate the physiological and socioemotional sequelae associated with the condition and to increase clinician awareness of the complex, interdisciplinary rehabilitative needs among Veterans with bothersome tinnitus.
This qualitative study was part of a larger study about tinnitus and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Veterans were sampled to represent national Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) users with and without comorbid TBI, and who were or were not interested in tinnitus rehabilitation services. Forty Veterans with tinnitus were interviewed (32 men, eight women). Data were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach.
Major themes across the Veteran interviews included (a) functional effects of tinnitus on daily life, (b) tinnitus and other health conditions, (c) reactions to the lack of a cure for tinnitus, (d) strategies to improve quality of life and function, and (e) use of VA services for tinnitus.
Our findings highlight that bothersome tinnitus negatively impacted various aspects of daily functioning, including communication, sleep, concentration, and mood, suggesting a need for audiologists to work closely with mental health services to improve quality of life and functional status for those negatively impacted by the condition. Future work is needed to obtain the viewpoints of clinicians and other health care partners to better understand the barriers and facilitators to providing evidence-based tinnitus treatment in VA and non-VA settings.",brain injury
Selective digestive tract decontamination in critically ill adults with acute brain injuries: a post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial.,"['Paul JYoung', 'AnthonyDevaux', 'QiangLi', 'LaurentBillot', 'Joshua SDavis', 'AnthonyDelaney', 'Simon RFinfer', 'Naomi EHammond', 'SharonMicallef', 'Ian MSeppelt', 'BalasubramanianVenkatesh', 'John AMyburgh', 'NoneNone']","The aim of this study was to determine whether selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) reduces in-hospital mortality in mechanically ventilated critically ill adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute brain injuries or conditions.
We carried out a post hoc analysis from a crossover, cluster randomized clinical trial. ICUs were randomly assigned to adopt or not to adopt a SDD strategy for two alternating 12-month periods, separated by a 3-month inter-period gap. Patients in the SDD group (n = 2791; 968 admitted to the ICU with an acute brain injury) received a 6-hourly application of an oral paste and administration of a gastric suspension containing colistin, tobramycin, and nystatin for the duration of mechanical ventilation, plus a 4-day course of an intravenous antibiotic with a suitable antimicrobial spectrum. Patients in the control group (n = 3191; 1093 admitted to the ICU with an acute brain injury) received standard care. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality within 90 days. There were four secondary clinical outcomes: death in ICU, ventilator-, ICU- and hospital-free days to day 90.
Of 2061 patients with acute brain injuries (mean age, 55.8 years; 36.4% women), all completed the trial. In patients with acute brain injuries, there were 313/968 (32.3%) and 415/1093 (38%) in-hospital deaths in the SDD and standard care groups (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.92; p = 0.004). The use of SDD was associated with statistically significant improvements in the four clinical secondary outcomes compared to standard care. There was no significant heterogeneity of treatment effect between patients with and without acute brain injuries (interaction p = 0.22).
In this post hoc analysis of a randomized clinical trial in critically ill patients with acute brain injuries receiving mechanical ventilation, the use of SDD significantly reduced in-hospital mortality in patients compared to standard care without SDD. These findings require confirmation.",brain injury

Whether these outcomes are similar within an adolescent trauma population has not been previously investigated. We hypothesized intubation upon arrival for adolescent trauma patients with isolated head trauma to be associated with a higher risk of death and prolonged length of stay (LOS).
The 2017-2019 TQIP was queried for adolescents (age 12-16) presenting after isolated blunt head trauma (abbreviated injury scale [AIS] 
From 141 patients, 73 (51.8%) were intubated upon arrival. Intubated patients had a low complication rate (5.6%). Intubated and non-intubated patients had a similar rate and mortality risk (6.8% vs 1.5%,

Re-establishing this communication using neural interfaces has the potential to bridge the gap and restore upper extremity function to people with high tetraplegia. We report a novel approach for restoring upper extremity function using selective peripheral nerve stimulation controlled by intracortical microelectrode recordings from sensorimotor networks, along with restoration of tactile sensation of the hand using intracortical microstimulation.
A 27-year-old right-handed man with AIS-B (motor-complete, sensory-incomplete) C3-C4 tetraplegia was enrolled into the clinical trial. Six 64-channel intracortical microelectrode arrays were implanted into left hemisphere regions involved in upper extremity function, including primary motor and sensory cortices, inferior frontal gyrus, and anterior intraparietal area. Nine 16-channel extraneural peripheral nerve electrodes were implanted to allow targeted stimulation of right median, ulnar (2), radial, axillary, musculocutaneous, suprascapular, lateral pectoral, and long thoracic nerves, to produce selective muscle contractions on demand. Proof-of-concept studies were performed to demonstrate feasibility of using a brain-machine interface to read from and write to the brain for restoring motor and sensory functions of the participant's own arm and hand.
Multiunit neural activity that correlated with intended motor action was successfully recorded from intracortical arrays. Microstimulation of electrodes in somatosensory cortex produced repeatable sensory percepts of individual fingers for restoration of touch sensation. Selective electrical activation of peripheral nerves produced antigravity muscle contractions, resulting in functional movements that the participant was able to command under brain control to perform virtual and actual arm and hand movements. The system was well tolerated with no operative complications.
The combination of implanted cortical electrodes and nerve cuff electrodes has the potential to create bidirectional restoration of motor and sensory functions of the arm and hand after neurological injury.",brain injury

However, compared to other well-studied dietary fatty acids like eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), BLCFA has received disproportionate attention despite their potential importance. Here we outlined the major food sources, estimated intake, absorption, and metabolism in human cells, and bioactive properties of BLCFA with a focus on the bioactive mechanisms to advocate for an increased commitment to BLCFA investigations.

Oxyberberine an Oxoderivative of Berberine Confers Neuroprotective Effects in Controlled-Cortical Impact Mouse Model of Traumatic Brain Injury.,"['Priya MounikaTentu', 'Mohd RabiBazaz', 'TulasiPasam', 'Arbaz SujatShaikh', 'ZiaurRahman', 'AtulMourya', 'Venkata RaoKaki', 'JitenderMadan', 'Manoj PDandekar']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is known as a silent epidemic that causes many deaths and disabilities worldwide. We examined the response of oxyberberine (OBB) in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 microglial cells and a controlled-cortical impact (CCI) mouse model of TBI.
We synthesized OBB from berberine, and also prepared OBB-nanocrystals (OBB-NC). Male C57BL/6 mice were used for CCI surgery, and post-CCI neurobehavioral deficits were assessed from 1 h after injury through 21 days post-injury (dpi).
OBB treatment reduced the lipopolysaccharide-triggered elevated levels of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) in BV2 microglial cells, indicating a neuroprotective potential. CCI-operated mice exhibited significant neurological deficits on 1, 3, and 5 dpi in neurological severity scoring and rotarod assay. OBB (25 and 50 mg/kg/day) and OBB-NC (3 mg/kg/day) ameliorated these neurological aberrations. Mice subjected to CCI surgery also displayed anxiogenic- and depression-like behaviours, and cognitive impairments in forced-swimming test and elevated-zero maze, and novel object recognition task, respectively. Administration of OBB reduced these long-term neuropsychiatric complications, and also levels of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), high-motility group protein 1 (HMGB1), NF-κB, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 6 cytokines in the ipsilateral cortex of mice.
We suggest that the administration of OBB offers neuroprotective effects via inhibition of HMGB1-mediated TLR4/NFκB pathway.",brain injury
Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cells Improve the Status of Hypoxic/Ischemic Cerebral Palsy Rats by Downregulating NogoA/NgR/Rho Pathway.,"['YaolingLuo', 'JiayangQu', 'ZhengyiHe', 'MinhongZhang', 'ZhengweiZou', 'LincaiLi', 'YuxianZhang', 'JunsongYe']","Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSC) have shown promising potential in ameliorating brain injury, but the mechanism is unclear. We explore the role of NogoA/NgR/Rho pathway in mediating hUCMSC to improve neurobehavioral status and alleviate brain injury in hypoxia/ischemia-induced CP (cerebral palsy) rat model in order to promote the clinical application of stem cell therapy in CP. The injury model of HT22 cells was established after 3 h hypoxia, and then co-cultured with hUCMSC. The rat model of CP was established by ligation of the left common carotid artery for 2.5 h. Subsequently, hUCMSC was administered via the tail vein once a week for a total of four times. The neurobehavioral status of CP rats was determined by behavioral experiment, and the pathological brain injury was determined by pathological staining method. The mRNA and protein expressions of NogoA, NgR, RhoA, Rac1, and CDC42 in brain tissues of rats in all groups and cell groups were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blot, and immunofluorescence. The CP rats exhibited obvious motor function abnormalities and pathological damage. Compared with the control group, hUCMSC transplantation could significantly improve the neurobehavioral situation and attenuate brain pathological injury in CP rats. The relative expression of NogoA, NgR, RhoA mRNA, and protein in brain tissues of rats in the CP group was significantly higher than the rats in the sham and CP+hUCMSC group. The relative expression of Rac1, CDC42 mRNA, and protein in brain tissues of rats in the CP group was significantly lower than the rats in the sham and CP+hUCMSC group. The animal experiment results were consistent with the experimental trend of hypoxic injury of HT22 cells. This study confirmed that hUCMSC can efficiently improve neurobehavioral status and alleviate brain injury in hypoxia/ischemia-induced CP rat model and HT22 cell model through downregulating the NogoA/NgR/Rho pathway.",brain injury

"GOALS OF CARE ARE RARELY DISCUSSED PRIOR TO POTENTIALLY FUTILE TRAUMA TRANSFER: IS IT OKAY TO SAY ""NO""?","['NellieTrenga-Schein', 'DavidZonies', 'MackenzieCook']","It is unknown how often the physician-to-physician trauma transfer conversation includes a discussion of patient goals of care (GOC). We hypothesized that physicians would rarely discuss GOC on transfer calls when faced with patients with catastrophic injuries.
We completed a retrospective case series of trauma patients transferred to an ACS verified level 1 trauma center between 2018 and 2022 who died or were discharged to hospice without surgical intervention within 48 hours. Transfer call recordings were analyzed for GOC conversations.
A total of 5,562 patients were accepted as transfers and 82 (1.5%) met inclusion criteria. Eighty of the 82 patients had recorded transfer calls and were analyzed. The most common transfer reason was traumatic brain injury (TBI) and need for neurosurgical capabilities (53%) followed by complex multisystem trauma (23%). There was explicit discussion of code status prior to transfer in 20% and a more in depth GOC conversation for 10% patients. Appropriateness of transfer was discussed in 21% and at least one physician expressed explicit concerns of futility for 14%, though all were subsequently transferred. Code status was changed immediately upon arrival for 15% for patients and 19% of patients transferred neurosurgical expertise were deemed to have non-survivable injuries based on the imaging and exam that was unchanged from the referring hospital.
Among a group of profoundly injured trauma patients at high risk of death, an explicit discussion of GOC occurred in just 10%. This suggests that even when the catastrophic nature of patient injury is understood, transfers still occur, and patients and their families are subjected to an expensive, disruptive, and displacing experience with little to no anticipated benefit. A discussion of GOC and therapeutic objectives should be considered in all severely injured trauma patients prior to transfer.

Electroconvulsive therapy is associated with increased immunoreactivity of neuroplasticity markers in the hippocampus of depressed patients.,"['DoreLoef', 'IndiraTendolkar', 'Philip F Pvan Eijndhoven', 'Jeroen J MHoozemans', 'Mardien LOudega', 'Annemieke J MRozemuller', 'Paul JLucassen', 'AnnemiekDols', 'Anke ADijkstra']","Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective therapy for depression, but its cellular effects on the human brain remain elusive. In rodents, electroconvulsive shocks increase proliferation and the expression of plasticity markers in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), suggesting increased neurogenesis. Furthermore, MRI studies in depressed patients have demonstrated increases in DG volume after ECT, that were notably paralleled by a decrease in depressive mood scores. Whether ECT also triggers cellular plasticity, inflammation or possibly injury in the human hippocampus, was unknown. We here performed a first explorative, anatomical study on the human post-mortem hippocampus of a unique, well-documented cohort of bipolar or unipolar depressed patients, who had received ECT in the 5 years prior to their death. They were compared to age-matched patients with a depressive disorder who had not received ECT and to matched healthy controls. Upon histopathological examination, no indications were observed for major hippocampal cell loss, overt cytoarchitectural changes or classic neuropathology in these 3 groups, nor were obvious differences present in inflammatory markers for astrocytes or microglia. Whereas the numbers of proliferating cells expressing Ki-67 was not different, we found a significantly higher percentage of cells positive for Doublecortin, a marker commonly used for young neurons and cellular plasticity, in the subgranular zone and CA4 / hilus of the hippocampus of ECT patients. Also, the percentage of positive Stathmin 1 cells was significantly higher in the subgranular zone of ECT patients, indicating neuroplasticity. These first post-mortem observations suggest that ECT has no damaging effects but may rather have induced neuroplasticity in the DG of depressed patients.",brain injury
The effect of amantadine on acute cognitive disability after severe traumatic brain injury: An institutional pilot study.,"['Brett MTracy', 'ShruthiSrinivas', 'Kelly DNahum', 'Wendy LWahl', 'Rondi BGelbard']","Amantadine is used in the post-acute care setting to improve cognitive function after a traumatic brain injury. Its utility in the acute postinjury period is unknown. In this pilot study, we sought to examine the effect of amantadine on short-term cognitive disability among patients with a severe traumatic brain injury and hypothesized that patients receiving amantadine would have a greater improvement in disability throughout their acute hospitalization.
We performed a prospective, observational study of patients ≥18 years with severe traumatic brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale ≤8) at a level I trauma center between 2020 and 2022. Patients with penetrating trauma, death within 48 hours of admission, and no radiographic evidence of intracranial pathology were excluded. Patients were grouped according to whether they received amantadine. Our primary outcome was the change in cognitive disability, measured by the Disability Rating Scale (DRS), over the index hospitalization.
There were 55 patients in the cohort: 41.8% (n = 23) received amantadine and 58.2% (n = 32) did not. There were higher rates of motor vehicle collisions (65.2% vs 46.9%, P = .02), diffuse axonal injury (47.8% vs 18.8%, P = .02), intracranial pressure monitor use (73.9% vs 21.9%, P = .0001), and propranolol use (73.9% vs 21.9%, P = .0001) in the amantadine. There was a larger improvement in DRS scores among patients receiving amantadine (7.8 vs 3.6, P = .001), and amantadine independently predicted improvement in DRS scores (β, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-3.02, P = .03). Rates of discharge to traumatic brain injury rehabilitation were significantly higher in the amantadine group (73.9% vs 21.9%, P = .0002).
Among patients with severe traumatic brain injury, amantadine use in the acute postinjury period may be associated with an improvement in cognitive disability and discharge to traumatic brain injury rehabilitation.",brain injury

After adjustment for potential confounders, the lncRNA H19 predicted the incidence of the primary endpoint (HR 1.194, 95 % C.I. 1.012-1.409, p = 0.036), whereas the lncRNA NKILA was associated with lacunar stroke (HR 0.571, 95 % C.I. 0.375-0.868, p = 0.006).
In a prospective cohort of non-institutionalized elderly subjects, high levels of lncRNA H19 are associated with a higher risk of death, while low levels of lncRNA NKILA predict an increased risk of lacunar stroke.",brain injury
Ginsenoside RK3 promotes neurogenesis in Alzheimer's disease through activation of the CREB/BDNF pathway.,"['LingyuShe', 'HaoTang', 'YuqingZeng', 'LiweiLi', 'LiXiong', 'JinfengSun', 'FanChen', 'JuanRen', 'JingZhang', 'WeiWang', 'XiaZhao', 'GuangLiang']","In the ancient book ""Shen Nong's Herbal Classic,"" Panax ginseng CA Mey was believed to have multiple benefits, including calming nerves, improving cognitive function, and promoting longevity. Ginsenosides are the main active ingredients of ginseng. Ginsenoside RK3 (RK3), a rare ginsenoside extracted from ginseng, displays strong pharmacological potential. Furthermore, its impact on neurogenesis remains insufficiently investigated.
This study aims to investigate whether RK3 improves learning and memory by promoting neurogenesis, and to explore the mechanism of RK3 action.
The therapeutic effect of RK3 on learning and memory was determined by the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition test (NORT). The pathogenesis and protective effect of RK3 on primary neurons and animal models were detected by immunofluorescence and western blotting. Protein expression of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway was detected by western blotting.
Our results showed that RK3 treatment significantly improved cognitive function in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice and C57BL/6 (C57) mice. RK3 promotes neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in the mouse hippocampus. In vitro, RK3 prevents Aβ-induced injury in primary neurons and promotes the proliferation of PC12 as well as the expression of synapse-associated proteins. Mechanically, RK3 plays a positive role in vivo and in vitro through the CREB-BDNF pathway.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that RK3 promotes learning and cognition in APP/PS1 and C57 mice by promoting neurogenesis and synaptogenesis through the CREB-BDNF signaling pathway. Therefore, RK3 is expected to be further developed into a potential drug candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).",brain injury
Interfering TRIB3 protects the blood brain barrier through PI3K/Akt pathway to alleviate cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in diabetes mellitus mice.,"['Heng-JunZhou', 'Xiao-YiWang', 'Li-QingWang', 'Jie-ShengZheng', 'Ren-YaZhan', 'Jian-WeiPan']","This study aimed to treat diabetic cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CI/RI) by affecting blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and integrity. The CI/RI model in DM mice and a high glucose (HG) treated oxygen and glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) brain endothelial cell model were established for the study. Evans blue (EB) staining was used to evaluate the permeability of BBB in vivo. TTC staining was used to analyze cerebral infarction. The location and expression of tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) in endothelial cells were detected by immunofluorescence. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expressions of TRIB3, tight junction molecules, adhesion molecules, phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) and AKT. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were detected by qRT-PCR. Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran were used to measure vascular permeability in vitro. TRIB3 ubiquitination and acetylation levels were detected. Acetyltransferase bound to TRIB3 were identified by immunoprecipitation. TRIB3 was localized in cerebral endothelial cells and was highly expressed in diabetic CI/R mice. The BBB permeability in diabetic CI/R mice and HG-treated OGD/R cells was increased, while the junction integrity was decreased. Interference with TRIB3 in vitro reduces BBB permeability and increases junction integrity. In vivo interfering with TRIB3 reduced cerebral infarction volume, BBB permeability and inflammation levels, and upregulated p-AKT levels. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin reversed the effects of TRIB3-interfering plasmid. In vitro HG treatment induced TRIB3 acetylation through acetyltransferase p300, which in turn reduced ubiquitination and stabilized TRIB3. Interfering TRIB3 protects BBB by activating PI3K/AKT pathway and alleviates brain injury, which provides a new target for diabetic CI/RI.",brain injury
Histological and cytochemical analysis of the brain under conditions of hypobaric hypoxia-induced oxygen deficiency in albino rats.,"['RuzannaShushanyan', 'AnnaGrigoryan', 'TamaraAbgaryan', 'AnnaKarapetyan']","High altitude sickness is a life-threatening disease that occurs among acclimatized individuals working or living at a high altitude accompanied by hypobaric hypoxia exposure. The prolonged influence of hypobaric hypoxia on the brain may trigger neuronal damage and cell death due to an oxygen deficiency. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the histomorphological changes in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex, and striatum of the rat's brain following chronic hypobaric hypoxia. Fourteen albino rats were used for this investigation. The animals were exposed to chronic hypobaric hypoxia in the special decompression chamber at an altitude of 7000 m for 7 days. The histological analysis was conducted via toluidine staining and silver impregnation. DNA damage and cell apoptosis were assessed via Feulgen staining. The histochemical assessment revealed increased dark neurons in the hippocampus with cell swelling. Silver impregnation showed increased argyrophilic neurons in the cerebellar cortex, striatum, CA1 subfield of the hippocampus, and cerebral cortex. The cytochemical analysis determined the increased apoptotic cells with hyperchromatic condensation and pyknosis in the hippocampus subfields and cerebral cortex. In addition, it has been observed that hypoxia has resulted in small hemorrhages and perivascular edema within the cerebellar and cerebral cortex. The results indicate brain injury observed in the various parts of the brain towards hypobaric hypoxia, however, the hippocampus showed greater vulnerability against hypoxic exposure in comparison to the striatum, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex. These changes support our insights regarding brain intolerance under conditions of hypoxia-induced oxygen deficiency and its histomorphological manifestations.",brain injury
"Neurovascular Correlates of Cobalamin, Folate, and Homocysteine in Dementia.","['Min-ChienTu', 'Hsiao-WenChung', 'Yen-HsuanHsu', 'Jir-JeiYang', 'Wen-ChauWu']","Cobalamin (Cbl) and folate are common supplements clinicians prescribe as an adjuvant therapy for dementia patients, on the presumption of their neurotrophic and/or homocysteine (Hcy) lowering effect. However, the treatment efficacy has been found mixed and the effects of Cbl/folate/Hcy on the human brain remain to be elucidated.
To explore the neurovascular correlates of Cbl/folate/Hcy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD).
Sixty-seven AD patients and 57 SIVD patients were prospectively and consecutively recruited from an outpatient clinic. Multimodal 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging was performed to quantitatively evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and white matter integrity. The relationship between neuroimaging metrics and the serum levels of Cbl/folate/Hcy was examined by using the Kruskal-Wallis test, partial correlation analysis, and moderation analysis, at a significance level of 0.05.
As a whole, CBF mainly associated with Cbl/folate while white matter hyperintensities exclusively associated with Hcy. As compared with AD, SIVD exhibited more noticeable CBF correlates (spatially widespread with Cbl and focal with folate). In SIVD, a bilateral Cbl-moderated CBF coupling was found between medial prefrontal cortex and ipsilateral basal ganglia, while in the fronto-subcortical white matter tracts, elevated Hcy was associated with imaging metrics indicative of increased injury in both axon and myelin sheath.
We identified the neurovascular correlates of previously reported neurotrophic effect of Cbl/folate and neurotoxic effect of Hcy in dementia. The correlates exhibited distinct patterns in AD and SIVD. The findings may help improving the formulation of supplemental Cbl/folate treatment for dementia.",brain injury
Boosting brain-computer interfaces with functional electrical stimulation: potential applications in people with locked-in syndrome.,"['EvanCanny', 'Mariska JVansteensel', 'Sandra M Avan der Salm', 'Gernot RMüller-Putz', 'JuliaBerezutskaya']","Individuals with a locked-in state live with severe whole-body paralysis that limits their ability to communicate with family and loved ones. Recent advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology have presented a potential alternative for these people to communicate by detecting neural activity associated with attempted hand or speech movements and translating the decoded intended movements to a control signal for a computer. A technique that could potentially enrich the communication capacity of BCIs is functional electrical stimulation (FES) of paralyzed limbs and face to restore body and facial movements of paralyzed individuals, allowing to add body language and facial expression to communication BCI utterances. Here, we review the current state of the art of existing BCI and FES work in people with paralysis of body and face and propose that a combined BCI-FES approach, which has already proved successful in several applications in stroke and spinal cord injury, can provide a novel promising mode of communication for locked-in individuals.",brain injury
Admission S100B fails as neuro-marker but is a good predictor for intrahospital mortality in major trauma patients.,"['DanielEssl', 'HerbertSchöchl', 'DanielOberladstätter', 'ChrisLockie', 'MohamedIslam', 'CyrillSlezak', 'Wolfgang GVoelckel']","S100 B is an extensively studied neuro-trauma marker, but its specificity and subsequently interpretation in major trauma patients might be limited, since extracerebral injuries are known to increase serum levels. Thus, we evaluated the potential role of S100B in the assessment of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in multiple injured patients upon emergency room (ER) admission and the first days of intensive care unit (ICU) stay.
Retrospective study employing trauma registry data derived from a level 1 trauma center. Four cohorts of patients were grouped: isolated TBI (iTBI), polytrauma patients with TBI (PT + TBI), polytrauma patients without TBI (PT-TBI) and patients without polytrauma or TBI (control). S100B-serum levels were assessed immediately after admission in the emergency room and during the subsequent ICU stay. Values were correlated with injury severity score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and in-hospital mortality.
780 predominantly male patients (76 %) with a median age of 48 (30-63) and a median ISS of 24 (17-30) were enrolled in the study. Admission S100B correlated with ISS and TBI severity defined by the GCS (both p < 0.0001) but not with head abbreviated injury score (AIS) (p = 0.38). Compared with survivors, non-survivors had significantly higher median S100B levels in the ER (6.14 μg/L vs. 2.06 μg/L; p < 0.0001) and at ICU-day 1 (0.69 μg/L vs. 0.17 μg/L; p < 0.0001). S100B in the ER predicted mortality with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.77 (95 % CI 0,70-0,83, p < 0.0001), vs. 0.86 at ICU-day 1 (95 % CI 0,80-0,91, p < 0.0001).
In conclusion, S100B is a valid biomarker for prediction of mortality in major trauma patients with a higher accuracy when assessed at the first day of ICU stay vs. immediately after ER admission. Since S100B did not correlate with pathologic TBI findings in multiple injured patients, it failed as predictive neuro-marker because extracerebral injuries demonstrated a higher influence on admission levels than neurotrauma. Although S100B levels are indicative for injury severity they should be interpreted with caution in polytrauma patients.",brain injury
"Medical AI, inductive risk and the communication of uncertainty: the case of disorders of consciousness.",['JonathanBirch'],"Some patients, following brain injury, do not outwardly respond to spoken commands, yet show patterns of brain activity that indicate responsiveness. This is 'cognitive-motor dissociation' (CMD). Recent research has used machine learning to diagnose CMD from electroencephalogram recordings. These techniques have high false discovery rates, raising a serious problem of inductive risk. It is no solution to communicate the false discovery rates directly to the patient's family, because this information may confuse, alarm and mislead. Instead, we need a procedure for generating case-specific probabilistic assessments that can be communicated clearly. This article constructs a possible procedure with three key elements: (1) A shift from categorical 'responding or not' assessments to degrees of evidence; (2) The use of patient-centred priors to convert degrees of evidence to probabilistic assessments; and (3) The use of standardised probability yardsticks to convey those assessments as clearly as possible.",brain injury

While cognitive impairment has been well described in children, currently available data are limited in adults. As a result, guidance on the optimal cognitive screening strategies in adults is scarce. We conducted a systematic review to identify the different screening tools that have been evaluated in SCD. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence of suspected cognitive impairment in this population. In this qualitative synthesis, we present 8 studies that evaluated 6 different screening tools. Patient characteristics that impacted on cognitive screening performance included age, education level, and a prior history of stroke. We report a pooled prevalence of 38% [14-62%] of suspected cognitive impairment. We discuss the relative benefits and limitations of the different screening tools to help clinicians select an adapted approach tailored to their specific patients' needs. Further studies are needed to establish and validate cognitive screening strategies in patients with diverse cultural and educational backgrounds.",brain injury
A plausible historical and forensic account of the death of Thomas Aquinas.,"['Gabriel JLeBeau', 'Abdul-RahmanAlkiswani', 'Daniel JMauro', 'Paul JCamarata']","Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) was an influential medieval Christian theologian and arguably one of the greatest scholastic philosophers. He produced more than 60 works in his 48 years, including his magnum opus, the Summa Theologica. The Catholic Church regards him as a canonized saint and one of 37 Doctors of the Church. On his way to an ecumenical council in 1274, he was ""struck with sudden illness"" requiring rest at a monastery where he was cared for until death several weeks later. An obscure Latin text describes an incident where he hit his head violently on an overhanging branch. Becoming progressively ill, he arrived at a Cistercian abbey where he died on March 7. Through an analysis of his final illness as documented in key Latin and Italian historical texts, and careful observation of the reputed skull relic in Priverno, Italy, the authors postulate that Aquinas may have suffered a traumatic brain injury and that his death at age 48 was occasioned by a chronic subdural hematoma. Examination of the skull was inconclusive; however, the historical textual analysis supports this theory. A more in-depth forensic analysis of the skull may help confirm the diagnosis.",brain injury
Targeting symptom-specific networks with TMS.,"['Shan HSiddiqi', 'Michael DFox']","Increasing evidence suggests that the clinical effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are target-dependent. Within any given symptom, precise targeting of specific brain circuits may improve clinical outcomes. This principle can also be extended across symptoms - stimulation of different circuits may lead to different symptom-level outcomes. This may include targeting different symptoms within the same disorder (such as dysphoria versus anxiety in patients with major depression) or targeting the same symptom across different disorders (such as primary major depression and depression secondary to stroke, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, or Parkinson's disease). Some of these symptom-specific changes may be desirable, while others may be undesirable. This Review focuses on the conceptual framework via which symptom-specific target circuits may be identified, tested, and implemented.",brain injury
Association between systolic blood pressure and target organ damage in naturally occurring cases of systemic hypertension in the dog.,"['PriyankaMahadappa', 'KJeyaraja', 'P SThirunavakkarasu', 'NarayananKrishnaswamy']","Chronic elevation in the systolic blood pressure (SBP) adversely affects the lifespan in the dog by causing injury to the eye, heart, kidney and brain. Understanding the association between SBP and target organ damage (TOD) helps in risk categorization and treatment planning. Therefore, a prospective study was undertaken to find the association between SBP and renal resistive index (RI) in naturally occurring cases of canine systemic hypertension. Based on the ACVIM guidelines 2018, dogs (n=135) were categorized into four risk groups of SBP, viz., A (minimal), B (low), C (moderate), and D (high). Ophthalmoscopy and echocardiography were used to assess ocular and cardiac changes, respectively. Nephrosonography, urinalysis, and RI were used to assess kidney damage. Odds ratio (OR) was used to quantify the risk of TOD for different categories of SBP. One-way Anova with Tukey's post-hoc test was used to test the effect of different SBP risk groups on urine protein creatinine ratio (UPC) and RI as well as the effect of number of TOD on the RI. Pearson's correlation test was done to see the relation of SBP with UPC and RI. Tortuous retinal vessels were common in group B with an OR of 11 (95% CI: 0.59-207). Retinal hemorrhage and left ventricular hypertrophy were common in group D with an OR of 13 (95% CI: 0.67-234) and 11 (95% CI: 0.61-207), respectively.

The prodrome is the earliest phase of a migraine attack and is characterised by non-aura symptoms that precede headache onset. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ubrogepant 100 mg compared with placebo for the acute treatment of migraine when administered during the prodrome.
This PRODROME trial was a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of ubrogepant 100 mg conducted at 75 research centres and headache clinics in the USA. Eligible participants were adults aged 18-75 years who had at least a 1-year history of migraine with or without aura and a history of two to eight migraine attacks per month with moderate to severe headache in each of the 3 months before screening. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either receive placebo to treat the first qualifying prodrome event and ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the second qualifying prodrome event or to receive ubrogepant 100 mg to treat the first qualifying prodrome event and placebo to treat the second qualifying prodrome event. An automated interactive web-response system used permuted blocks of four to manage randomisation. All people giving interventions and assessing outcomes were masked to group assignment during the study. People doing data analysis, which occurred after study completion, were not masked to group assignment. During the double-blind treatment period, each participant was instructed to orally take two tablets of the study drug at the onset of each qualifying prodrome event. The primary endpoint was absence of moderate or severe intensity headache within 24 h after study-drug dose; efficacy analyses were conducted with the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population, defined as all randomly assigned participants with at least one headache assessment within 24 h after taking the study drug during the treatment period. The safety population included all treated participants who took at least one administration of study drug. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04492020).
Between Aug 21, 2020, and April 19, 2022, 518 participants were randomly assigned to double-blind crossover treatment. The safety population included 480 participants and the mITT population included 477 participants; 421 (88%) of 480 participants were female and 59 (12%) were male. Absence of moderate or severe headache within 24 h after a dose occurred after 190 (46%) of 418 qualifying prodrome events that had been treated with ubrogepant and after 121 (29%) of 423 qualifying prodrome events that had been treated with placebo (odds ratio 2·09, 95% CI 1·63-2·69; p<0·0001). Adverse events that occurred within 48 h after study-drug administration were reported after 77 (17%) of 456 qualifying prodrome events that had been treated with ubrogepant and after 55 (12%) of 462 events that had been treated with placebo.
Ubrogepant was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of migraine attacks when taken during the prodrome.

CXCR4-BTK axis mediate pyroptosis and lipid peroxidation in early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage via NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-κB pathway.,"['ChengliLiu', 'KunYao', 'QiTian', 'YujiaGuo', 'GuijunWang', 'PeibangHe', 'JianfengWang', 'JianWang', 'ZhanZhang', 'MingchangLi']","C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is critical for homeostasis of the adaptive and innate immune system in some CNS diseases. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is an essential kinase that regulates inflammation in immune cells through multiple signaling pathways. This study aims to explore the effect of CXCR4 and BTK on neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis of early brain injury (EBI) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Our results showed that the expression of CXCR4 and p-BTK increased significantly at 24 h after SAH in vivo and in vitro. Ibrutinib improved neurological impairment, BBB disruption, cerebral edema, lipid peroxidation, neuroinflammation and neuronal death at 24 h after SAH. Inhibition of BTK phosphorylation promoted the in vitro transition of hemin-treated proinflammatory microglia to the anti-inflammatory state, inhibited the p-P65 expression and microglial pyroptosis. NLRP3 deficiency can significantly reduce pyroptosis in SAH mice. Moreover, CXCR4 inhibition can suppress NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis, NF-κB activation and NOX2 expression in vitro, and ibrutinib can abolish CXCR4-aggravated BBB damage and pyroptosis in EBI after SAH. The levels of CXCR4 in CSF of SAH patients is significantly increased, and it is positively correlated with GSDMD and IL-1β levels, and have a moderate diagnostic value for outcome at 6-month follow-up. Our findings revealed the effect of CXCR4 and P-BTK on NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis and lipid peroxidation after SAH in vivo and in vitro, and the potential diagnostic role of CXCR4 in CSF of SAH patients. Inhibition of CXCR4-BTK axis can significantly attenuate NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis and lipid peroxidation by regulating NF-κB activation in EBI after SAH.",brain injury
NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy aggravate intestinal oxidative stress and ferroptosis after traumatic brain injury.,"['HejunZhang', 'YalongGao', 'CongWang', 'XingqiHuang', 'TuoLi', 'KaijiLi', 'RuilongPeng', 'FanjianLi', 'LeiLi', 'XuZhang', 'LichuanYin', 'ShuZhang', 'JianningZhang']","Intestinal injury caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI) seriously affects patient prognosis; however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated that ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis is involved in several intestinal disorders. However, uncertainty persists regarding the role of ferritinophagy-mediated ferroptosis in the intestinal damage caused by TBI. High-throughput transcriptional sequencing was used to identify the genes that were differentially expressed in the intestine after TBI. The intestinal tissues were harvested for hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE), immunofluorescence, and western blot (WB). Lipid peroxide markers and iron content in the intestines were determined using the corresponding kits. High throughput sequencing revealed that the ferroptosis signaling pathway was enriched, demonstrating that intestinal damage caused by TBI may include ferroptosis. Chiu's score, tight junction proteins, and lipid peroxide indicators demonstrated that TBI caused an intestinal mucosal injury that persisted for several days. The ferroptosis pathway-related proteins, ferritin heavy polypeptide 1 (Fth1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), exhibited dynamic changes. The results indicated that lipid peroxide products were markedly increased, whereas antioxidant enzymes were markedly decreased. WB analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), LC3II/LC3I, and p62 were markedly upregulated, whereas those of GPX4 and Fth1 were markedly downregulated. In addition, ferrostatin-1 attenuates intestinal ferroptosis and injury post-TBI in vivo. Intriguingly, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) reduces intestinal ferritin decomposition, iron accumulation, and ferroptosis after TBI. Moreover, 3-MA markedly reduced intestinal apoptosis. In conclusion, NCOA4 mediated ferritinophagy and ferroptosis play roles in intestinal oxidative stress injury post-TBI. This study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying intestinal damage following TBI.",brain injury
We should be screening for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) in all older adults at risk of falling: a commentary on the World Falls Guidelines.,"['YuxiaoLi', 'Rebecca MSmith', 'Susan LWhitney', 'Barry MSeemungal', 'Toby JEllmers']","Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is amongst the commonest causes of dizziness and falls in older adults. Diagnosing and treating BPPV can reduce falls, and thereby reduce fall-related morbidity and mortality. Recent World Falls Guidelines recommend formal assessment for BPPV in older adults at risk of falling, but only if they report vertigo. However, this recommendation ignores the data that (i) many older adults with BPPV experience dizziness as vague unsteadiness (rather than vertigo), and (ii) others may experience no symptoms of dizziness at all. BPPV without vertigo is due to an impaired vestibular perception of self-motion, termed 'vestibular agnosia'. Vestibular agnosia is found in ageing, neurodegeneration and traumatic brain injury, and results in dramatically increased missed BPPV diagnoses. Patients with BPPV without vertigo are typically the most vulnerable for negative outcomes associated with this disorder. We thus recommend simplifying the World Falls Guidelines: all older adults (>60 years) with objective or subjective balance problems, irrespective of symptomatic complaint, should have positional testing to examine for BPPV.",brain injury

We found that the expression of MFG-E8 was significantly decreased in the brain of mice after bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). MFG-E8 knockout mice demonstrated more severe BCAS-induced cognitive impairments in the behavioral tests. In addition, we discovered that the deletion of MFG-E8 aggravated white matter damage and the destruction of myelin microstructure through fluorescent staining and electron microscopy.

Relationship between the shape of intracranial pressure pulse waveform and computed tomography characteristics in patients after traumatic brain injury.,"['AgnieszkaKazimierska', 'AgnieszkaUryga', 'CyprianMataczyński', 'MarekCzosnyka', 'Erhard WLang', 'MagdalenaKasprowicz', 'NoneNone']","Midline shift and mass lesions may occur with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and are associated with higher mortality and morbidity. The shape of intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse waveform reflects the state of cerebrospinal pressure-volume compensation which may be disturbed by brain injury. We aimed to investigate the link between ICP pulse shape and pathological computed tomography (CT) features.
ICP recordings and CT scans from 130 TBI patients from the CENTER-TBI high-resolution sub-study were analyzed retrospectively. Midline shift, lesion volume, Marshall and Rotterdam scores were assessed in the first CT scan after admission and compared with indices derived from the first 24 h of ICP recording: mean ICP, pulse amplitude of ICP (AmpICP) and pulse shape index (PSI). A neural network model was applied to automatically group ICP pulses into four classes ranging from 1 (normal) to 4 (pathological), with PSI calculated as the weighted sum of class numbers. The relationship between each metric and CT measures was assessed using Mann-Whitney U test (groups with midline shift > 5 mm or lesions > 25 cm
PSI was significantly higher in patients with mass lesions (with lesions: 2.4 [1.9-3.1] vs. 1.8 [1.1-2.3] in those without; p << 0.001) and those with midline shift (2.5 [1.9-3.4] vs. 1.8 [1.2-2.4]; p < 0.001), whereas mean ICP and AmpICP were comparable. PSI was significantly correlated with the extent of midline shift, total lesion volume and the Marshall and Rotterdam scores. PSI showed AUCs > 0.7 in classification of patients as presenting pathological CT features compared to AUCs ≤ 0.6 for mean ICP and AmpICP.
ICP pulse shape reflects the reduction in cerebrospinal compensatory reserve related to space-occupying lesions despite comparable mean ICP and AmpICP levels. Future validation of PSI is necessary to explore its association with volume imbalance in the intracranial space and a potential complementary role to the existing monitoring strategies.",brain injury

SAH was established in adult male mice via endovascular perforation, and flow cytometry, a bone marrow chimera model, qPCR, and microglial depletion experiments were conducted to explore the origin and chemotaxis mechanism of the immune cells. To investigate cell effects on SAH prognosis, murine neurological function was evaluated based on a modified Garcia score, pole test, and rotarod test.
The bioinformatics analysis confirmed that inflammatory and immune responses were the key pathophysiological processes after SAH. Significant increases in the monocyte levels were observed in both the mouse brains and the peripheral blood of patients after SAH. Ly6C-high monocytes originated in the bone marrow, and the skull bone marrow contribute a higher proportion of these monocytes than neutrophils. The mRNA level of Ccl2 was significantly upregulated after SAH and was greater in CD11b-positive than CD11b-negative cells. Microglial depletion, microglial inhibition, and CCL2 blockade reduced the numbers of Ly6C-high monocytes after SAH. With CCR2 antagonization, the neurological function of the mice exhibited a slow recovery. Three days post-SAH, the monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDC) population had a higher proportion of TNF-α-positive cells and a lower proportion of IL-10-positive cells than the macrophage population. The ratio of moDCs to macrophages was higher on day 3 than on day 5 post-SAH.
Inflammatory and immune responses are significantly involved in SAH-induced brain injury. Ly6C-high monocytes derived from the bone marrow, including the skull bone marrow, infiltrated into mouse brains via CCL2 secreted from microglia. Moreover, Ly6C-high monocytes alleviated neurological dysfunction after SAH.",brain injury
Prediction of therapeutic intensity level from automatic multiclass segmentation of traumatic brain injury lesions on CT-scans.,"['ClémentBrossard', 'JulesGrèze', 'Jules-Arnaudde Busschère', 'ArnaudAttyé', 'MarionRichard', 'Florian DhaussyTornior', 'ClémentAcquitter', 'Jean-FrançoisPayen', 'Emmanuel LBarbier', 'PierreBouzat', 'BenjaminLemasson']","The prediction of the therapeutic intensity level (TIL) for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients at the early phase of intensive care unit (ICU) remains challenging. Computed tomography images are still manually quantified and then underexploited. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-based tool to segment brain lesions on admission CT-scan and predict TIL within the first week in the ICU. A cohort of 29 head injured patients (87 CT-scans; Dataset1) was used to localize (using a structural atlas), segment (manually or automatically with or without transfer learning) 4 or 7 types of lesions and use these metrics to train classifiers, evaluated with AUC on a nested cross-validation, to predict requirements for TIL sum of 11 points or more during the 8 first days in ICU. The validation of the performances of both segmentation and classification tasks was done with Dice and accuracy scores on a sub-dataset of Dataset1 (internal validation) and an external dataset of 12 TBI patients (12 CT-scans; Dataset2). Automatic 4-class segmentation (without transfer learning) was not able to correctly predict the apparition of a day of extreme TIL (AUC = 60 ± 23%). In contrast, manual quantification of volumes of 7 lesions and their spatial location provided a significantly better prediction power (AUC = 89 ± 17%). Transfer learning significantly improved the automatic 4-class segmentation (DICE scores 0.63 vs 0.34) and trained more efficiently a 7-class convolutional neural network (DICE = 0.64). Both validations showed that segmentations based on transfer learning were able to predict extreme TIL with better or equivalent accuracy (83%) as those made with manual segmentations. Our automatic characterization (volume, type and spatial location) of initial brain lesions observed on CT-scan, publicly available on a dedicated computing platform, could predict requirements for high TIL during the first 8 days after severe TBI. Transfer learning strategies may improve the accuracy of CNN-based segmentation models.Trial registrations Radiomic-TBI cohort; NCT04058379, first posted: 15 august 2019; Radioxy-TC cohort; Health Data Hub index F20220207212747, first posted: 7 February 2022.",brain injury
"Evaluating the effects of brain injury, disease and tasks on cognitive fatigue.","['Glenn RWylie', 'Helen MGenova', 'BingYao', 'NancyChiaravalloti', 'Cristina A FRomán', 'Brian MSandroff', 'JohnDeLuca']","Because cognitive fatigue (CF) is common and debilitating following brain injury or disease we investigated the relationships among CF, behavioral performance, and cerebral activation within and across populations by combining the data from two cross-sectional studies. Individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) were included to model CF resulting from neurological disease; individuals who had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) were included to model CF resulting from neurological insult; both groups were compared with a control group (Controls). CF was induced while neuroimaging data was acquired using two different tasks. CF significantly differed between the groups, with the clinical groups reporting more CF than Controls-a difference that was statistically significant for the TBI group and trended towards significance for the MS group. The accrual of CF did not differ across the three groups; and CF ratings were consistent across tasks. Increasing CF was associated with longer response time for all groups. The brain activation in the caudate nucleus and the thalamus was consistently correlated with CF in all three groups, while more dorsally in the caudate, activation differed across the groups. These results suggest the caudate and thalamus to be central to CF while more dorsal aspects of the caudate may be sensitive to damage associated with particular types of insult.",brain injury
eIF4E phosphorylation mediated LPS induced depressive-like behaviors via ameliorated neuroinflammation and dendritic loss.,"['QichaoGong', 'WeifenLi', 'TahirAli', 'YueHu', 'ShengnanMou', 'ZizhenLiu', 'ChengyouZheng', 'RuyanGao', 'AxiangLi', 'TaoLi', 'NingningLi', 'ZhijianYu', 'ShupengLi']","The translational defect has emerged as a common feature of neurological disorders. Studies have suggested that alterations between opposing and balanced synaptic protein synthesis and turnover processes could lead to synaptic abnormalities, followed by depressive symptoms. Further studies link this phenomenon with eIF4E and TrkB/BDNF signaling. However, the interplay between the eIF4E and TrkB/BDNF signaling in the presence of neuroinflammation is yet to be explored. To illuminate the role of eIF4E activities within LPS-induced neuroinflammation and depression symptomology, we applied animal behavioral, biochemical, and pharmacological approaches. In addition, we sought to determine whether eIF4E dysregulated activities correlate with synaptic protein loss via the TrkB/BDNF pathway. Our results showed that LPS administration induced depressive-like behaviors, accompanied by neuroinflammation, reduced spine numbers, and synaptic protein dysregulation. Concurrently, LPS treatment enhanced eIF4E phosphorylation and TrkB/BDNF signaling defects. However, eFT508 treatment rescued the LPS-elicited neuroinflammation and depressive behaviors, as well as altered eIF4E phosphorylation, synaptic protein expression, and TrkB/BDNF signaling. The causal relation of eIF4E with BDNF signaling was further explored with TrkB antagonist K252a, which could reverse the effects of eFT508, validating the interplay between the eIF4E and TrkB/BDNF signaling in regulating depressive behaviors associated with neuroinflammation via synaptic protein translational regulation. In conclusion, our results support the involvement of eIF4E-associated translational dysregulation in synaptic protein loss via TrkB/BDNF signaling, eventually leading to depressiven-like behaviors upon inflammation-linked stress.",brain injury

Alcohol Consumption During Adolescence Alters the Cognitive Function in Adult Male Mice by Persistently Increasing Levels of DUSP6.,"['MizhuSun', 'QingmengZheng', 'LuluWang', 'RunzhiWang', 'HengzhenCui', 'XinleiZhang', 'ChenXu', 'FangyuanYin', 'HongtaoYan', 'XiaomengQiao']","Binge alcohol drinking during adolescence has long-term effects on the adult brain that alter brain structure and behaviors, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is involved in the synaptic plasticity and pathological brain injury by regulating the expression of cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Dual-specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) is a critical effector that dephosphorylates ERK1/2 to control the basal tone, amplitude, and duration of ERK signaling. To explore DUSP6 as a regulator of ERK signaling in the mPFC and its impact on long-term effects of alcohol, a male mouse model of adolescent intermittent alcohol (AIA) exposure was established. Behavioral experiments showed that AIA did not affect anxiety-like behavior or sociability in adulthood, but significantly damaged new object recognition and social recognition memory. Molecular studies further found that AIA reduced the levels of pERK-pCREB-BDNF-PSD95/NR2A involved in synaptic plasticity, while DUSP6 was significantly increased. Intra-mPFC infusion of AAV-DUSP6-shRNA restored the dendritic spine density and postsynaptic density thickness by reversing the level of p-ERK and its downstream molecular expression, and ultimately repaired adult cognitive impairment caused by chronic alcohol exposure during adolescence. These findings indicate that AIA exposure inhibits ERK-CREB-BDNF-PSD95/NR2A by increasing DUSP6 in the mPFC in adulthood that may be associated with long-lasting cognitive deficits.",brain injury
RCOR1 improves neurobehaviors and neuron injury in rat cerebral palsy by Endothelin-1 targeting-induced Akt/GSK-3β pathway upregulation.,"['HaiXu', 'XuetaoYu', 'RongXie', 'YangyangWang', 'ChunliLi']","RE1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST) corepressor 1 (RCOR1) has been reported to orchestrate neurogenesis, while its role in cerebral palsy (CP) remains elusive. Besides, RCOR1 can interact with Endothelin-1 (EDN1), and EDN1 expression is related to brain damage. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the effects of RCOR1/EDN1 on brain damage during the progression of CP.
CP rats were established via hypoxia-ischemia insult, and injected with lentivirus-RCOR1, followed by examination of brain pathological conditions. The RCOR1 and EDN1 interaction was recognized using hTFtarget. Healthy rat cortical neuron cells received interference of RCOR1/EDN1 expression, and underwent oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) treatment, after which phenotypic and molecular assays were conducted through the biochemical method, qRT-PCR and/or western blot.
RCOR1 was low-expressed but EDN1 was high-expressed in CP model rats and OGD/R-treated neurons. RCOR1 overexpression ameliorated rat neurobehaviors, alleviated brain pathological conditions, reduced TUNEL-positive cells, decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) level and repressed EDN1 expression in the brains of CP model rats. In neurons, RCOR1 overexpression counteracted OGD/R-induced viability decrease, reduction of the levels of RCOR1, SOD, Bcl-2, caspase-3, p-Akt/Akt and p-GSK-3β/GSK-3β, and elevation of the levels of EDN1, ROS, Bax, and cleaved caspase-3, while EDN1 overexpression did contrarily on these events. Moreover, there was a negative interplay between RCOR1 overexpression and EDN1 overexpression in OGD/R-induced neurons.
RCOR1 ameliorates neurobehaviors and suppresses neuronal apoptosis and oxidative stress in CP through EDN1 targeting-mediated upregulation of Akt/GSK-3β.",brain injury
Hypopituitarism after traumatic brain injury in adults: Clinical guidelines of the neuroendocrinology area of the Spanish Society of Endocrinology and Nutrition (SEEN).,"['EvaFernández Rodriguez', 'RocíoVillar Taibo', 'IgnacioBernabeu']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with hypopituitarism with a variable incidence, depending on the time and methods used to diagnosis, and on factors related to the trauma, such as its severity, its anatomical location and the drugs used in the acute phase. The pituitary gland can be damaged directly by the impact or secondary to factors such as ischemia, inflammation, excitotoxicity or immunity. In acute phases ACTH deficiency is the most relevant, since failure to detect and treat it can compromise the patient's life. Clinical manifestations are typical of each hormone deficient axes, although the combination hypopituitarism-trauma has been associated with cognitive deterioration, worse metabolic profile and greater impairment of quality of life. One of the clinical challenges is to determine which patients benefit from a systematic hormonal evaluation, and therefore from hormone replacement, and what is the appropriate time to do so and the most suitable diagnostic methods.",brain injury
A multimodal pipeline for image correction and registration of mass spectrometry imaging with microscopy.,"['WeiweiTang', 'ZhenLi', 'YuchenZou', 'JunLiao', 'BinLi']","The integration of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) and histology plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of complex heterogeneous tissues, which provides a comprehensive description of biological tissue with both wide molecule coverage and high lateral resolution. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy for the correction and registration of MALDI MSI data with hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining images. To overcome the challenges of discrepancies in spatial resolution towards the unification of the two imaging modalities, a deep learning-based interpolation algorithm for MALDI MSI data was constructed, which enables spatial coherence and the following orientation matching between images. Coupled with the affine transformation (AT) and the subsequent moving least squares algorithm, the two types of images from one rat brain tissue section were aligned automatically with high accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrated the practicality of the developed pipeline by projecting it to a rat cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury model, which would help decipher the link between molecular metabolism and pathological interpretation towards microregion. This new approach offers the chance for other types of bioimaging to boost the field of multimodal image fusion.",brain injury
Structural and functional changes in the brain after chronic complete thoracic spinal cord injury.,"['JingLi', 'YiShan', 'XiaojingZhao', 'GuixiangShan', 'Peng-HuWei', 'LinLiu', 'ChangmingWang', 'HangWu', 'WeiqunSong', 'YiTang', 'Guo-GuangZhao', 'JieLu']","This study aimed to investigate whether brain anatomical structures and functional network connectivity are altered after chronic complete thoracic spinal cord injury (cctSCI) and to determine how these changes impact clinical outcomes. Structural and resting-state functional MRI was performed for 19 cctSCI patients (18 for final statistics) and 19 healthy controls. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to assess gray matter volume (GMV) with differences between cctSCI patients and controls. VBM results were used as seeds for whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis. The relationship between brain changes and clinical variables was investigated. Compared with those of the control group, the left triangular inferior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, orbital inferior frontal gyrus, precuneus and parietal superior gyrus volumes of SCI patients decreased, while the left superior frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area volumes increased. Additionally, when the regions with increased GMV were used as seeds, the FC of the parahippocampus and thalamus increased. Subsequent partial correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between FC and total sensorimotor score based on the ASIA criteria (p = 0.001, r = 0.746). Overall, the structural and functional changes in the brain after cctSCI occurred in some visual and cognitive areas and sensory or motor control areas. These findings aid in improving our understanding of the underlying brain injury mechanisms and the subsequent structural and functional reorganization to reveal potential therapeutic targets and track treatment outcomes.",brain injury
Simple approach to quantify hypoxic-ischemic brain injury severity from computed tomography imaging files after cardiac arrest.,"['Nicholas PCase', 'Clifton WCallaway', 'JonathanElmer', 'Patrick JCoppler Pa-C', 'NoneNone']","Grey-white ratio (GWR) can estimate severity of cytotoxic cerebral edema secondary to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury after cardiac arrest and predict progression to death by neurologic criteria (DNC). Current approaches to calculating GWR are not standardized and have variable interrater reliability. We tested if measures of variance of brain attenuation on early computed tomographic (CT) imaging after cardiac arrest could predict DNC.
We performed a retrospective cohort study, identifying post-arrest patients treated between 2011 and 2020 at our single center. We extracted demographic data from our registry and Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) files for each patient's first brain CT. We analyzed slices 15-20 of each DICOM, corresponding to the level of the basal ganglia while accommodating differences in patient anatomy. We extracted pixel arrays and converted the radiodensities to Hounsfield units (HU). To focus on brain tissue densities, we excluded HU >60 and <10. We calculated the variance of each patient's HU distribution and difference between the means of a two-group Gaussian finite mixture model as proxies for manually calculated GWR. We compared these metrics to existing measures of cerebral edema, then randomly divided our data into 80% training set and 20% test sets and used logistic regression to predict DNC.
Of 1,133 included patients, 457 (40%) were female, mean (standard deviation) age was 58 (16) years, and 115 (10%) progressed to DNC. CTs were obtained a median [interquartile range] of 4.2 [2.8-5.7] hours post-arrest. Our novel measures correlated weakly with GWR but differed significantly between patients with and without qualitative features of cerebral edema. HU variance, but not difference between mixture model means, differed significantly between subjects with and without sulcal or cistern effacement. GWR outperformed our novel measures in predicting progression to DNC with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.82, compared to HU variance (AUC = 0.73) and the difference between mixture model means (AUC = 0.56).
There are differences in the distribution of HU on post-arrest CT in patients with qualitative measures of cerebral edema. Current methods to quantify cerebral edema outperform simple measures of attenuation variance on early brain CT. Further analyses could investigate if these measures of variance, or other distributional characteristics of brain attenuation, have improved predictive performance on brain CTs obtained later in the clinical course or derived from discrete regions of anatomical interest.",brain injury
Clinical descriptors of disease trajectories in patients with traumatic brain injury in the intensive care unit (CENTER-TBI): a multicentre observational cohort study.,"['Cecilia A IÅkerlund', 'AndersHolst', 'ShubhayuBhattacharyay', 'NinoStocchetti', 'EwoutSteyerberg', 'PeterSmielewski', 'David KMenon', 'AriErcole', 'David WNelson', 'NoneNone']","Patients with traumatic brain injury are a heterogeneous population, and the most severely injured individuals are often treated in an intensive care unit (ICU). The primary injury at impact, and the harmful secondary events that can occur during the first week of the ICU stay, will affect outcome in this vulnerable group of patients. We aimed to identify clinical variables that might distinguish disease trajectories among patients with traumatic brain injury admitted to the ICU.
We used data from the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) prospective observational cohort study. We included patients aged 18 years or older with traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the ICU at one of the 65 CENTER-TBI participating centres, which range from large academic hospitals to small rural hospitals. For every patient, we obtained pre-injury data and injury features, clinical characteristics on admission, demographics, physiological parameters, laboratory features, brain biomarkers (ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 [UCH-L1], S100 calcium-binding protein B [S100B], tau, neurofilament light [NFL], glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP], and neuron-specific enolase [NSE]), and information about intracranial pressure lowering treatments during the first 7 days of ICU stay. To identify clinical variables that might distinguish disease trajectories, we applied a novel clustering method to these data, which was based on a mixture of probabilistic graph models with a Markov chain extension. The relation of clusters to the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) was investigated.
Between Dec 19, 2014, and Dec 17, 2017, 4509 patients with traumatic brain injury were recruited into the CENTER-TBI core dataset, of whom 1728 were eligible for this analysis. Glucose variation (defined as the difference between daily maximum and minimum glucose concentrations) and brain biomarkers (S100B, NSE, NFL, tau, UCH-L1, and GFAP) were consistently found to be the main clinical descriptors of disease trajectories (ie, the leading variables contributing to the distinguishing clusters) in patients with traumatic brain injury in the ICU. The disease trajectory cluster to which a patient was assigned in a model was analysed as a predictor together with variables from the IMPACT model, and prediction of both mortality and unfavourable outcome (dichotomised GOS-E ≤4) was improved.
First-day ICU admission data are not the only clinical descriptors of disease trajectories in patients with traumatic brain injury. By analysing temporal variables in our study, variation of glucose was identified as the most important clinical descriptor that might distinguish disease trajectories in the ICU, which should direct further research. Biomarkers of brain injury (S100B, NSE, NFL, tau, UCH-L1, and GFAP) were also top clinical descriptors over time, suggesting they might be important in future clinical practice.

Regenerative capacity of neural tissue scales with changes in tissue mechanics post injury.,"['AlejandroCarnicer-Lombarte', 'Damiano GBarone', 'FilipWronowski', 'George GMalliaras', 'James WFawcett', 'KristianFranze']","Spinal cord injuries have devastating consequences for humans, as mammalian neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) cannot regenerate. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), however, neurons may regenerate to restore lost function following injury. While mammalian CNS tissue softens after injury, how PNS tissue mechanics changes in response to mechanical trauma is currently poorly understood. Here we characterised mechanical rat nerve tissue properties before and after in vivo crush and transection injuries using atomic force microscopy-based indentation measurements. Unlike CNS tissue, PNS tissue significantly stiffened after both types of tissue damage. This nerve tissue stiffening strongly correlated with an increase in collagen I levels. Schwann cells, which crucially support PNS regeneration, became more motile and proliferative on stiffer substrates in vitro, suggesting that changes in tissue stiffness may play a key role in facilitating or impeding nervous system regeneration.",brain injury
"Using interleukin-18, Eotaxin-1, and Eotaxin-3 to identify brain injury in neonates with congenital heart disease.","['SumanGhosh', 'Mark SBleiweis', 'Jeffrey PJacobs', 'EduardoCandelario-Jalil']","Serum biomarkers for brain injury in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD) provide a bedside tool for early identification and intervention. In this preliminary study, we aim to evaluate IL-18, Eotaxin-1 and Eotaxin-3 as biomarkers for the detection of brain injury in neonates with CHD.
We prospectively enrolled seven neonates diagnosed in-utero with CHD and obtained serum samples at birth, before and after surgery. Samples were analyzed using a human cytokine/chemokine multiplex assay. Brain injury was diagnosed on brain MRI before surgery.
Samples from seven neonates at four time points before surgery and three time points after surgery were analyzed. A significant difference was found in neonates with brain injury compared to CHD neonates without. Elevations in interleukin (IL)-18 pre- and post-operative (p = 0.007), IL-18 pre-operative (p = 0.046), Eotaxin-1 pre-operative (p = 0.011), and Eotaxin-3 pre- and post-operative (p = 0.026) were found in CHD neonates with brain injury.
This is the first published report on the use IL-18, Eotaxin-1, and Eotaxin-3 in the detection of brain injury for neonates with CHD.

Arsenic induced neurotoxicity in the brain of ducks: The potential involvement of the gut-brain axis.,"['ShaofengWu', 'GaolongZhong', 'QianSu', 'TingHu', 'GanRao', 'TongLi', 'YuhanWu', 'ZhiyanRuan', 'HuiZhang', 'ZhaoxinTang', 'LianmeiHu']","Arsenic is a widely distributed ecotoxic pollutant that has been found to cause neurotoxicity in a variety of species. Gut-brain axis is a two-way information network between the gut microbiome and the brain, which is closely related to organismal health. However, the role of the gut-brain axis in arsenic-induced neurotoxicity remains largely unknown.
In order to explore whether there is a relationship between brain and gut microbiota of meat ducks, we performed molecular biological detection including RT-qPCR and Western blot, as well as morphological detection including, HE staining and immunohistochemistry. Meanwhile, intestinal contents were analyzed using 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and analysis RESULTS: In this study, we investigated whether arsenic trioxide (ATO) can activate the gut microbiome-brain axis to induce intestinal and brain injury. The results showed that ATO-exposure disrupted the diversity balance of intestinal microbiota and integrity and injured the intestinal structure. ATO-exposure also reduced the number of glycogen and goblet cells in the duodenum. In addition, exposure to ATO caused intestinal inflammatory injury by activating NF-κB signaling pathway and promoting the expression of its target genes. Meanwhile, the tight junction-related proteins (ZO-1, occludin) of gut and brain were reduced by ATO exposure. Furthermore, results also revealed that ATO-exposure induced brain injury, including neuronal cell vacuolization and reduced numbers of neuronal cells in the cortex and hippocampus. Remarkably, ATO-exposure also disrupted neurotransmitter levels. Additionally, our further molecular mechanism study revealed that ATO-exposure increased the expression of autophagy and apoptosis related mRNA and proteins levels in the brain tissues.
Altogether, these findings provide a new insight into that ATO-exposure induced intestinal injury and aggravated neurotoxicity via the gut-brain axis.",brain injury
Beneficial effect of GABA-rich fermented milk whey on nervous system and intestinal microenvironment of aging mice induced by D-galactose.,"['WeiHe', 'HeSong', 'ZibiaoYang', 'ShiweiZhao', 'JuanMin', 'YanJiang']","This study aims to investigate the protective effect of a freeze-dried powder prepared from a fermentation milk whey containing a high-yield GABA strain (FDH-GABA) against D-galactose-induced brain injury and gut microbiota imbalances in mice by probing changes to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. A prematurely aged mouse model was established by performing the subcutaneous injection of D-galactose. Subsequently, the effects of FDH-GABA on the nervous system and intestinal microenvironment of the mice were explored by measuring their antioxidant activities, anti-inflammatory state, autophagy, pathway-related target protein expression levels, and intestinal microorganisms. Compared to the D-gal group, FDH-GABA improved the levels of SOD, T-AOC, IL-10, and neurotransmitters, while it reduced the contents of MDA and TNF-α. FDH-GABA also promoted autophagy and inhibited the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the brains of the aged mice. Moreover, FDH-GABA restored the diversity of their intestinal flora. Pathological observations indicated that FDH-GABA was protective against damage to the brain and intestine of D-galactose-induced aging mice. These results reveal that FDH-GABA not only improved antioxidant stress, attenuated inflammation, restored the neurotransmitter content, and protected the tissue structure of the intestine and brain, but also effectively improved their intestinal microenvironment. The ameliorative effect of FDH-GABA on premature aging showed a clear dose-response relationship, and at the same time, the changes of intestinal microorganisms showed a certain correlation with the relevant indexes of nervous system. These findings provide insight into the effect of the FDH-GABA intervention on aging, providing a novel means for alleviating detrimental neurodegenerative changes in the aging population.",brain injury
Real-time model-based cerebral perfusion calculation for ischemic stroke.,"['HaoSun', 'BaoLi', 'JinchengLiu', 'XiaoluXi', 'LiyuanZhang', 'YanpingZhang', 'GuangfeiLi', 'HuameiGuo', 'KenanGu', 'TongnaWang', 'ChuanqiWen', 'YoujunLiu']","Clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke commonly relies on examining cerebral perfusion changes by using computed tomography perfusion (CTP) techniques. However, the radiation dose in CTP is quite higher in comparison to computed tomography angiography (CTA), with associated costs and time.
Hence, this study established a lumped-parameter model (LPM) of brain tissue microcirculation (BTM) based on CTA, aiming to achieve real-time calculation of cerebral perfusion. After validation of calculated flow results with clinical data, the BTM-LPM model was used to examine the changes in cerebral perfusion following ischemic stroke, in which the effects of nine anatomical structures of the Circle of Willis (CoW) together with various distribution patterns of stenosis in the feeding arteries were considered.
When compared the calculated flow results from BTM-LPM with the clinically measured data of literature, the mean squared error (MSE) value for the feeding arteries was 3.9 % and its total value for microcirculatory flow in each region was 0.1 %. Notably, the calculation time was 35.6 s. In the case of the CoW missing the left and right posterior communicating artery, a 60 % stenosis of the basilar artery is likely to cause ischemic damage to some temporal and occipital lobes of the right and left hemispheres. While in the case of the CoW missing the anterior communicating artery and the left posterior communicating artery, ischemic damage to the entire frontal lobe and parts of the temporal and parietal lobes of the left hemisphere was found when 80 % stenosis occurred in the left internal carotid artery.
The BTM-LPM proposed in this study could accurately calculate cerebral perfusion in real time and demonstrated the importance of CoW anatomy in different ischemic injuries to cerebral tissue. The calculated cerebral perfusion would be a reference value for early diagnosis and preoperative planning of different ischemic injuries to cerebral tissue, thereby the BTM-LPM holds great promising for replacing CTP examination.",brain injury

The primary outcome was the catheter tip location on postprocedural CT. Secondary outcomes included number of catheter passes, clinically significant hemorrhages, and procedure-related infections.
Fifty patients were enrolled. Indications included subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, hydrocephalus, pseudotumor, and postsurgical wound drainage. In total, 76% (38/50) of patients underwent right-sided placement and 24% (12/50) underwent left-sided placement. All 100% (50/50) of patients had successful cannulation with an average of 1.06 passes. Postprocedural head CT confirmed ipsilateral frontal horn or third ventricle placement (Kakarla grade 1) in 92% (46/50) of patients and placement in the contralateral lateral ventricle in 8% (4/50) (Kakarla grade 2).

"Focal brain oxygen, blood flow, and intracranial pressure measurements in relation to optimal cerebral perfusion pressure.","['Adam IPelah', 'MarekCzosnyka', 'SarahMenacho', 'EnyinnaNwachuku', 'Gregory W JHawryluk']","Different paradigms for neurocritical care of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have emerged in conjunction with advanced neuromonitoring technologies and derived metrics. The priority for optimizing these metrics is not currently clear. The goal of this study was to determine whether achieving cerebral perfusion pressure (CPPopt) also improves other metrics like brain oxygenation and brain blood flow.
The authors performed a retrospective analysis of high-frequency data from patients with TBI who were treated at a single center and who had partial pressure of brain oxygen (PbtO2) measurements and/or brain blood flow measurements, while also undergoing intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. CPPopt was not calculated or targeted during patient care, but was retrospectively computed, as was the difference between the observed CPP and CPPopt.
A total of 22 patients with ICP, PbtO2, and/or brain blood flow monitoring were included in the analysis, and 245.7 days of measurements obtained every second were analyzed including 6,748,866 PbtO2 measurements, 3,296,405 blood flow measurements, and 10,264,770 ICP measurements. The data obtained every second were averaged by minute for analysis. In summative data, PbtO2 measurements peaked near CPPopt and were not improved above CPPopt. Blood flow measurements remained stable near CPPopt, decreased below it, and increased when CPP exceeded CPPopt. ICP decreased linearly with CPP without a specific relationship with CPPopt. In an inverse analysis, the percentage of CPP values at CPPopt, although significantly higher on the favorable side of contemporary treatment thresholds of PbtO2, ICP, and blood flow, was not found to be strongly correlated with the mean values of the physiological measurements obtained every minute (r = 0.27, r = 0.11, and r = 0.47 for ICP, PbtO2, and blood flow, respectively; p < 0.0001).
Although CPPopt was not targeted in the patients in this study, CPPopt was a physiologically significant value based on concurrent measurements of PbtO2 and blood flow. In summative data, achievement of CPPopt was associated with optimized PbtO2 and blood flow. Conversely, the correlation between achievement of CPPopt and the mean measurement value was not strong, strengthening the significance of CPPopt. In individual patients, achieving CPPopt is not always associated with optimal PbtO2 or blood flow. Further research should explore these relationships in treatment paradigms that specifically target CPPopt. These data do not support the premise that targeting and achieving CPPopt obviates the need for concurrent PbtO2 and blood flow monitoring. Although these data suggest that targeting CPPopt may be an appropriate initial treatment strategy, they do not provide evidence that CPPopt should be targeted with highest priority.",brain injury
Acute psychological symptom profiles in high school football players following sport-related concussion.,"['Maryam YJawid', 'Kristen LWilliams', 'JacobJo', 'Tyler MHill', 'Olivia LProsak', 'AmadAmedy', 'Trevor JAnesi', 'Douglas PTerry', 'Scott LZuckerman']","In a cohort of high school football athletes, the authors sought to 1) describe the proportion of those with acute psychological symptoms postconcussion, 2) determine predictors of more acute psychological symptoms postconcussion, and 3) determine if acute psychological symptoms impact recovery.
A retrospective cohort study of high school football athletes (14-18 years of age) who sustained a sport-related concussion between November 2017 and April 2022 and presented to a multidisciplinary concussion center was performed. Based on their Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) scores at the initial clinic visit, their total psychological symptom cluster score was calculated by summing their scores for the four affective symptoms (irritability, sadness, nervousness, and feeling more emotional). The psychological symptom ratio was defined as the ratio of the psychological symptom cluster score to the total initial PCSS score. Primary outcomes included time to return to learn (RTL), symptom resolution, and return to play (RTP). Uni- and multivariable regression analyses were performed controlling for demographic factors, learning disabilities, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and personal and/or family history of psychological diagnoses and migraine.
A total of 195 male football players (mean age 16.2 ± 1.2 years) were included in the study. About one-third of the sample (n = 70, 35.9%) reported at least one psychological symptom. Of these 70 athletes, their psychological symptom scores were 1 (10.3%), 2 (7.7%), and ≥ 3 (17.9%). Irritability was the most endorsed psychological symptom (25.1%), followed by nervousness (15.9%), feeling more emotional (12.8%), and sadness (11.8%). The multivariable regression model showed that a positive psychological history (B = 2.66, 95% CI 0.74-4.58, p = 0.007) and family psychological history (B = 2.43, 95% CI 0.98-3.88, p = 0.001) were significant predictors of a higher psychological symptom cluster score. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that a higher psychological symptom cluster score was associated with a longer time to RTP (B = 1.22, 95% CI 0.17-2.264, p = 0.023) but not with time to symptom resolution or RTL. The psychological symptom ratio was not a significant predictor.
In a cohort of male football players, 36% reported at least one psychological symptom, with irritability being most commonly reported. Athletes with a personal and/or family history of psychological disorders experienced more acute psychological symptoms following a sport-related concussion. A higher psychological symptom cluster score was associated with delayed time to RTP but not time to RTL or symptom resolution.",brain injury
Fully Endoscopic Microvascular Decompression for Trigeminal Neuralgia Caused by Vertebrobasilar Artery: A Case Series Review: 2-Dimensional Operative Video.,"['JinxingSun', 'JiweiWang', 'JunhengJia', 'ZexinCao', 'ZhenkeLi', 'ChaoZhang', 'XingGuo', 'QianqianWu', 'WeiguoLi', 'XiangyuMa']","Microvascular decompression (MVD) is the most definitive and preferred surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (TN). Treatment of TN caused by the vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) has been reported to be challenging and less satisfactory in complications and recurrence. Endoscopy has been implemented to provide a comprehensive view of neurovascular conflicts and minimize brain tissue stretch injury while exploring the trigeminal nerve. However, there are few retrospective studies on the treatment of TN caused by VBA by fully endoscopic microvascular decompression (E-MVD). This article aimed to illustrate the safety and efficacy of E-MVD for TN caused by the VBA.
Clinical data for 26 patients with TN caused by the VBA who underwent E-MVD from 2019 to 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The characteristics of vertebrobasilar-associated TN were summarized. The safety and efficacy of E-MVD for vertebrobasilar-associated TN were estimated based on the analysis of intraoperative manipulation, postoperative symptom relief, and complications.
Intraoperatively, the vertebrobasilar artery was regarded as a direct offending vessel in all 26 patients with TN, the vertebral artery in 18 (69.23%) and the basilar artery in 10 (38.46%). In addition to the vertebrobasilar artery, other vessels involved included the superior cerebellar artery in 12 patients, anterior inferior cerebellar artery in 9, posterior inferior cerebellar artery in 1, and veins in 4. All patients underwent E-MVD, and TN was entirely resolved in 26 (100%) patients immediately postoperatively. During the follow-up period of 12-45 months, no recurrence or serious complications were found. There were no serious postoperative complications, such as cerebellar swelling, intracranial hemorrhage, or death.
E-MVD for vertebrobasilar-associated TN is effective and safe.",brain injury
Neurovascular Interventions for Neurotrauma: From Treatment of Injured Vessels to Treatment of the Injured Brain?,"['OmerDoron', 'Aman BPatel', 'Gregory W JHawryluk']","Traumatic brain injury is often associated with a direct or secondary neurovascular pathology. In this review, we present recent advancements in endovascular neurosurgery that enable accurate and effective vessel reconstruction with emphasis on its role in early diagnosis, the expanding use of flow diversion in pseudoaneurysms, and traumatic arteriovenous fistulas. In addition, future directions in which catheter-based interventions could potentially affect traumatic brain injury are described: targeting blood brain barrier integrity using the advantages of intra-arterial drug delivery of blood brain barrier stabilizers to prevent secondary brain edema, exploring the impact of endovascular venous access as a means to modulate venous outflow in an attempt to reduce intracranial pressure and augment brain perfusion, applying selective intra-arterial hypothermia as a neuroprotection method mitigating some of the risks conferred by systemic cooling, trans-vessel wall delivery of regenerative therapy agents, and shifting attention using multimodal neuromonitoring to post-traumatic vasospasm to further characterize the role it plays in secondary brain injury. Thus, we believe that the potential of endovascular tools can be expanded because they enable access to the ""highways"" governing perfusion and flow and call for further research focused on exploring these routes because it may contribute to novel endovascular approaches currently used for treating injured vessels, harnessing them for treatment of the injured brain.",brain injury
The Effect of Glycine and N-Acetylcysteine on Oxidative Stress in the Spinal Cord and Skeletal Muscle After Spinal Cord Injury.,"['XinXu', 'Chun-JiaZhang', 'ZuliyaerTalifu', 'Wu-BoLiu', 'Ze-HuiLi', 'Xiao-XinWang', 'Hua-YongDu', 'HanKe', 'De-GangYang', 'FengGao', 'Liang-JieDu', 'YanYu', 'Ying-LiJing', 'Jian-JunLi']","Oxidative stress is a frequently occurring pathophysiological feature of spinal cord injury (SCI) and can result in secondary injury to the spinal cord and skeletal muscle atrophy. Studies have reported that glycine and N-acetylcysteine (GlyNAC) have anti-aging and anti-oxidative stress properties; however, to date, no study has assessed the effect of GlyNAC in the treatment of SCI. In the present work, we established a rat model of SCI and then administered GlyNAC to the animals by gavage at a dose of 200 mg/kg for four consecutive weeks. The BBB scores of the rats were significantly elevated from the first to the eighth week after GlyNAC intervention, suggesting that GlyNAC promoted the recovery of motor function; it also promoted the significant recovery of body weight of the rats. Meanwhile, the 4-week heat pain results also suggested that GlyNAC intervention could promote the recovery of sensory function in rats to some extent. Additionally, after 4 weeks, the levels of glutathione and superoxide dismutase in spinal cord tissues were significantly elevated, whereas that of malondialdehyde was significantly decreased in GlyNAC-treated animals. The gastrocnemius wet weight ratio and total antioxidant capacity were also significantly increased. After 8 weeks, the malondialdehyde level had decreased significantly in spinal cord tissue, while reactive oxygen species accumulation in skeletal muscle had decreased. These findings suggested that GlyNAC can protect spinal cord tissue, delay skeletal muscle atrophy, and promote functional recovery in rats after SCI.",brain injury
A rapid realist review of clinical neuropsychology rehabilitation programmes to improve psychological wellbeing and quality of life for people with acquired brain injuries.,"['KFletcher', 'SWydera', 'NThorpe', 'KRadford', 'Rdas Nair', 'VBooth', 'NoneNone']","Approximately 20% of acquired brain injury (ABI) survivors experience reduced psychological wellbeing (PWB). Neuropsychological rehabilitation (NPR) is one approach supporting people with ABI to participate meaningfully in activities despite challenges. Although literature supports NPR effectiveness, little is known about change mechanisms. This systematic realist review identifies what NPR programmes have been designed, delivered, and evaluated for people with ABI to improve PWB and/or quality of life (QOL), as well as providing a context-relevant understanding of what NPR includes and how NPR might lead to positive outcomes. A rapid realist review was conducted in three phases: (1) structured retrieval and evidence extraction; (2) stakeholder consultation; (3) analysis and synthesis. Searches were completed, and findings from 35 publications and one stakeholder consultation were synthesized into a refined logic model. Six context-mechanism-outcome chains (CMOCs) were identified. Participants' relationships to internal experiences, and feelings of self-worth, mastery, and connection appeared to be mechanisms that led to improved PWB and QOL. Adaptation and individualized programmes were also key mechanisms to explain successful NPR. Embedding CMOCs into NPR could improve PWB and/or QOL for people with ABI. The logic model will inform ongoing development of a new online, group-based, NPR programme.",brain injury
Neural stem cell therapies for spinal cord injury repair: an update on recent preclinical and clinical advances.,"['Seyed MojtabaHosseini', 'BenBorys', 'Soheila-KarimiAbdolrezaee']","Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a leading cause of lifelong disabilities. Permanent sensory, motor and autonomic impairments after SCI are substantially attributed to degeneration of spinal cord neurons and axons, and disintegration of neural network. To date, minimal regenerative treatments are available for SCI with an unmet need for new therapies to re-construct the damaged spinal cord neuron-glia network and restore connectivity with the supraspinal pathways. Multipotent neural precursor cells (NPCs) have a unique capacity to generate neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. Due to this capacity, NPCs have been an attractive cell source for cellular therapies for SCI. Transplantation of NPCs have been extensively tested in preclinical models of SCI in the past two decades. These studies have identified opportunities and challenges associated with NPC therapies. While NPCs have the potential to promote neuroregeneration through various mechanisms, their low long-term survival and integration within the host injured spinal cord limit the functional benefits of NPC-based therapies for SCI. To address this challenge, combinatorial strategies have been developed to optimize the outcomes of NPC therapies by enriching SCI microenvironment, through biomaterials, genetic and pharmacological therapies. In this review, we will provide an in-depth discussion on recent advances in preclinical NPC-based therapies for SCI. We will discuss modes of actions and mechanism by which engrafted NPCs contribute to the repair process and functional recovery. We will also provide an update on current clinical trials and new technologies that have facilitated preparation of medical-grade human NPCs suitable for transplantation in clinical studies.",brain injury

PDGFR-beta signaling mediates endogenous neurogenesis after postischemic neural stem/progenitor cell transplantation in mice.,"['JieShen', 'TongZhang', 'HongGuan', 'XinLi', 'SainanZhang', 'GuihuaXu']","Although platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-β mediates the self-renewal and multipotency of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) 
The exogenous NSPCs were transplanted into the ischemic striatum of PDGFR-β conditionally neuroepithelial knockout (KO) mice at 24 h after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). 5-Bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was intraperitoneally injected to label the newly formed endogenous NSPCs. Infarction volume was measured, and behavioral tests were performed. In the subventricular zone (SVZ), proliferation of endogenous NSPCs was tested, and synapse formation and expression of nutritional factors were measured.
Compared with control mice, KO mice showed larger infarction volume, delayed neurological recovery, reduced numbers of BrdU positive cells, decreased expression of neurogenic factors (including neurofilament, synaptophysin, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor), and decreased synaptic regeneration in SVZ after tMCAO. Moreover, exogenous NSPC transplantation significantly alleviated neurologic dysfunction, promoted neurogenesis, increased expression of neurologic factors, and diminished synaptic deformation in SVZ of FL mice after tMCAO but had no beneficial effect in KO mice.
PDGFR-β signaling may promote activation of endogenous NSPCs after postischemic NSPC transplantation, and thus represents a novel potential regeneration-based therapeutic target.",brain injury
A Perspective on Hormonal Contraception Usage in Central Nervous System Injury.,"['HariPradhyumnan', 'Gina GPerez', 'Shahil HPatel', 'Meghan OBlaya', 'Helen MBramlett', 'AmiRaval']","Naturally occurring life stages in women are associated with changes in the milieu of endogenous ovarian hormones. Women of childbearing age may be exposed to exogenous ovarian hormone(s) due to their use of varying combinations of estrogen and progesterone hormones-containing oral contraceptives (OC; also known as ""the pill""). If women suffer central nervous system (CNS) injury such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) during their childbearing age, they are likely to retain their reproductive capabilities and may use OC. Many deleterious side effects of long-term OC use have been reported, such as aberrant blood clotting and endothelial dysfunction which consequently increase the risk of myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, and ischemic brain injury. Although controversial, studies have suggested that OC use is associated with neuropsychiatric ramifications, including uncontrollable mood swings and poorer cognitive performance. Our understanding about how the combination of endogenous hormones and OC-conferred exogenous hormones affect outcomes after CNS injuries remains limited. Therefore, understanding the impact of OC use on CNS injury outcomes needs further investigation to reveal underlying mechanisms, promote reporting in clinical or epidemiological studies, and raise awareness of possible compounded consequences. The goal of the current review is to discuss the impacts of CNS injury on endogenous ovarian hormones and vice-versa, as well as the putative consequences of exogenous ovarian hormones (OC) on the CNS to identify potential gaps in our knowledge to consider for future laboratory, epidemiological, and clinical studies.",brain injury
Therapeutic groups run for community-dwelling people with acquired brain injury: a scoping review.,"['CherylKotzur', 'FreyrPatterson', 'RosamundHarrington', 'SamanthaWent', 'ElspethFroude']","Therapeutic group interventions are commonly provided in acquired brain injury (ABI) inpatient rehabilitation settings, but little is known about the extent of therapeutic groups run for community-dwellers with ABI. This paper seeks to review current literature concerning the nature of therapeutic groups run for community-dwellers with ABI and the involvement of occupational therapists.
A scoping review was conducted with systematic searching of relevant databases guided by Arksey and O'Malley's framework. Studies were included if they reported on therapeutic groups for community-dwellers with ABI. Articles were collated and summarised with key findings presented in narrative form with accompanying tables.
Seventy articles met inclusion. Groups are used as therapeutic change agents for community-dwellers with ABI and target a diverse range of participation barriers. Participants valued group programs that established safe environments, a sense of belonging, growth opportunities and social connections. Group accessibility needs to be improved, with better funding avenues available for service providers, as well as greater consumer involvement in group design and facilitation.
Groups are a valuable therapeutic modality supporting community-dwellers with ABI. Further research is warranted into the use of groups by occupational therapists working with community-dwellers with ABI.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTherapeutic groups can support the development of social connections, community participation and help community-dwellers with ABI re-establish a positive self-identity.Conducting groups in community settings and involving consumers in group design and facilitation may enhance the group experience for participants.Occupational Therapists should be involved in the design and delivery of occupation-based and participation focused group-based programs.",brain injury
HSP90β regulates EAAT2 expression and participates in ischemia‑reperfusion injury in rats.,"['TaoLiang', 'XiaolinHu', 'LingZeng', 'ZhiweiZhou', 'JunZhang', 'ZucaiXu', 'JunweiZeng', 'PingXu']","Cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) have become a global public health problem and ischemia‑reperfusion injury, the major cause of neurological impairment exacerbation, is closely related to excitotoxicity. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of changes in heat shock protein (HSP)90β expression and verify whether HSP90β regulates EAAT2 expression in a cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion injury model. Healthy adult Sprague‑Dawley (SD) male rats were used to establish a control group, sham‑operated group, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) group, empty virus group and lentivirus group. A model of cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion was established using the MCAO method. Lentivirus construction and injection were used to interfere with the expression of HSP90β. The modified neurological severity score was used to assess neurological deficits. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to detect infarct areas. Immunofluorescence was used to detect HSP90β expression localization and the expression levels of HSP90β and EAAT2 were determined using western blotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. An MCAO model was successfully established and it was found that HSP90β, but not HSP90α, was upregulated after MCAO. HSP90β expression coincided with astrocyte markers in the ischemic penumbra area, while no expression was observed in microglia. Inhibition of HSP90β expression improved neurological deficits and alleviated brain injury by increasing EAAT2 expression. These results suggested that HSP90β is involved in the process of cerebral ischemia‑reperfusion injury in rats and that inhibition of HSP90β expression increases EAAT2 levels, conferring a neuroprotective effect in MCAO model rats.",brain injury
E-Scooters and Craniofacial Trauma: A Systematic Review.,"['Elizabeth ZGoh', 'NicholasBeech', 'Nigel RJohnson']","Systematic review.
Standing electric scooters (e-scooters) provide a cheap and environmentally friendly transport alternative, but also elicit substantial concern regarding their volume of associated injuries especially in the craniofacial region. This review aims to explore the demographics, risk factors, types of injury and surgical management of craniofacial trauma associated with e-scooters.
PubMed and Scopus databases were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria were clinical studies investigating craniofacial trauma associated with e-scooters. Exclusion criteria were duplicates; non-English publications; non-full-text publications; studies with insufficient data.
Of the 73 articles identified, 10 eligible articles representing 539 patients were included. The mean age was 31.5 years. Most cases were male (63.7%). Common risk factors were alcohol/drug intoxication, absence of distal extremity injuries and lack of helmet use. The most common mechanism of injury was mechanical falls (72.4%). The most common facial fracture pattern was middle third fractures (58.3%). Surgical management was required for 43.3% of fractures. Other types of injuries reported were traumatic brain injuries (17.6%), soft tissue injuries (58.3%), dental injuries (32.9%) and ophthalmological injuries (20.6%).
The findings of this review suggest common presentations for craniofacial trauma associated with e-scooters. Robust longitudinal evaluations with standardised descriptions of types of injuries are required. Gaps in knowledge relate to surgical management, post-operative complications and associated risk factors.",brain injury
Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) of Skull Base Tumours: A Review.,['Ahmed Nabil AbdelhamidAhmed'],"Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect tumors consistency, but it can't predict tumor stiffness or adherence of the tumor to nearby structures. Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a known non-invasive MRI based imaging technique used to assess the viscoelasticity of the tissues particularly liver fibrosis. This study discussed the importance of preoperative MRE in skull base tumors and the future implications of this new imaging modality. We did review of the English literature (by searching PubMed) regarding the use of MRE in preoperative assessment of skull base tumours stiffness and adherence to surrounding tissues. Recent research demonstrated that MRE can detect the stiffness and adherence of skull base tumors to surrounding structures by recording the spread of mechanical waves in the different tissues. In addition to non-radiation exposure, this technique is fast and can be incorporated into the conventional (MRI) study. MRE can palpate skull base tumours by imaging, allowing the stiffness of the tumour to be assessed. Preoperative assessment of brain tumours consistency, stiffness, and adherence to surrounding tissues is critical to avoid injury of important nearby structures and better preoperative patient counselling regarding surgical approach (endoscopic or open), operative time, and suspected surgical complications. However, the accuracy of MRE is less in small and highly vascular tumors. Also, MRE can't accurately detect tumour-brain adherence, but the new modality (slip-interface imaging) can. Hence, adding MRE to the conventional MRI study may help in preoperative diagnosis and treatment of skull base tumours.",brain injury
The role of community paramedicine in fall prevention: A SWOT analysis.,"['Carmen EQuatman', 'Jessica MWiseman', 'ChandlerDickinson', 'Monica CLeach', 'MichelleHislop', 'Deb AKegelmeyer', 'Anne DKloos', 'Catherine CQuatman-Yates']","Millions of older US adults fall annually, leading to catastrophic injuries, over 32,000 deaths and healthcare costs of over $55 billion. This study evaluated perceived benefits and limitations of using community paramedicine for fall prevention strategies from the lens of older adults, caregivers, and healthcare providers.
Semi-structured focus groups were held with individuals from three stakeholder groups: (1) community-dwelling older adults (age ≥60), (2) caregivers, and (3) healthcare providers. The Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) framework was used to quantitatively analyze stakeholder perceptions of using community paramedicine for fall prevention strategies.
A total of 10 focus groups were held with 56 participants representing older adults (n = 15), caregivers (n = 16), and healthcare providers (n = 25). Community paramedicine was supported as a model of fall prevention by older adults, caregivers, and healthcare providers. Participants identified strengths such as visibility to the home environment, ability to implement home modifications, implicit trust in emergency medical services (EMS), and capacity to redirect resources toward prevention. Additionally, participants acknowledged opportunities such as providing continuity of care across the healthcare spectrum, improving quality and safety of care and potentially reducing unnecessary emergency department use. Participants endorsed weaknesses and threats such as funding, concerns of patients about stigma, and struggles with medical data integration.
The results of this study illuminate the opportunity to leverage community paramedicine to address a variety of perceived barriers in order to design and implement better solutions for fall prevention efforts.",brain injury

Concussion-related disruptions to hub connectivity in the default mode network are related to symptoms and cognition.,"['Heather CarrieBouchard', 'Kate LHiggins', 'Grace KAmadon', 'Julia MLaing', 'ArthurMaerlender', 'SeimaAl-Momani', 'MaitalNeta', 'Cary RSavage', 'Douglas HSchultz']","Concussions present with a myriad of symptomatic and cognitive concerns; however, the relationship between these functional disruptions and the underlying changes in the brain are not yet well understood. Hubs, or brain regions that are connected to many different functional networks, may be specifically disrupted after concussion. Given the implications in concussion research, we quantified hub disruption within the default mode network (DMN) and between the DMN and other brain networks. We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from collegiate student-athletes (n = 44) at three timepoints: baseline (prior to beginning their athletic season), acute post-injury (approximately 48 hours after a diagnosed concussion), and recovery (after starting return-to-play progression, but prior to returning to contact). We used self-reported symptoms and computerized cognitive assessments collected across similar timepoints to link these functional connectivity changes to clinical outcomes. Concussion resulted in increased connectivity between regions within the DMN compared to baseline and recovery, and this post-injury connectivity was more positively related to symptoms and more negatively related to visual memory performance compared to baseline and recovery. Further, concussion led to decreased connectivity between DMN hubs and visual network non-hubs relative to baseline and recovery, and this post-injury connectivity was more negatively related to somatic symptoms and more positively related to visual memory performance compared to baseline and recovery. Relationships between functional connectivity, symptoms, and cognition were not significantly different at baseline versus recovery. These results highlight a unique relationship between self-reported symptoms, visual memory performance and acute functional connectivity changes involving DMN hubs after concussion in athletes. This may provide evidence for a disrupted balance of within- and between-network communication highlighting possible network inefficiencies after concussion. These results aid in our understanding of the pathophysiological disruptions after concussion and inform our understanding of the associations between disruptions in brain connectivity and specific clinical presentations acutely post-injury.",brain injury
Intimate partner violence and other trauma exposures in females with traumatic brain injury.,"['Nicola Lde Souza', 'RajKumar', 'ArielPruyser', 'EmilyBlunt', 'WilliamSanders', 'AnogueMeyden', 'PhoebeLawrence', 'UmeshVenkatesan', 'ChristineMacDonald', 'Jeanne MHoffman', 'Yelena GBodien', 'Brian LEdlow', ""KristenDams-O'Connor""]","We examined whether females with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and intimate partner violence (IPV) have greater exposure to lifetime trauma relative to females with TBI but no IPV history. Further, we assessed the effects of lifetime trauma on psychological outcomes following TBI. Female participants (n=70; age M(SD)= 50.5(15.2) years) with TBI (time since injury median (IQR)= 10.2 (5.3-17.8) years) completed a structured assessment of lifetime history of TBI, including an IPV module to query head injuries from physical violence by an intimate partner. We characterized lifetime trauma exposure with the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) questionnaire and Survey of Exposure to Community Violence (CV). We evaluated psychological functioning with self-report questionnaires of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety symptoms. Compared to those with no IPV history (n=51), participants reporting IPV-related head injuries (n=19; 27.1%) reported more ACEs (M(SD) IPV: 4.5(2.9); No IPV: 1.6(1.8), p<.001, d=1.08) and greater CV (IPV: 17.5(8.4); No IPV: 7.6(6.1), p<.001, d=1.26). Within the full sample, ACEs (β=0.21, 95% CI= 0.04-0.39) and CV (β=0.07, 95% CI=0.01-0.13) predicted worse PTSD symptoms, while IPV alone did not. Exposure to all three sources of trauma (ACEs, CV, and IPV) was associated with worse PTSD symptoms relative to fewer traumas. The results highlight the scope of traumatic exposures among TBI survivors, and the importance of considering IPV and other lifetime trauma exposure in assessing and treating TBI. Trauma-informed interventions that are modified for TBI-related impairment may offer improved outcomes in managing psychological symptoms.",brain injury
Hypothalamic Injury and Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Post-Traumatic Hyponatremia: A Diffusion Tensor Imaging Case-Control Study.,"['Sung HoJang', 'Min SooKang', 'Kyu HyangCho', 'Jung HwanPark']","BACKGROUND Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method used to identify changes in microstructures in the brain's white matter. Severe brain injuries after trauma are associated with disorders of consciousness (DOC) and may result in hyponatremia due to damage to the hypothalamus. This case-control study aimed to use DTI to evaluate the hypothalamus in 36 patients with hyponatremia and DOC due to severe brain injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS Thirty-six patients with DOC after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 36 healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of DOC was based on the coma recovery scale-revised (CRS-R). The 36 patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A (18 with hyponatremia, serum sodium level <135 mmol/L) and group B (18 without hyponatremia). The DTI scans were conducted using a 6-channel head coil on a 1.5T Philips Gyroscan Intera scanner. Among the DTI data, fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the hypothalamus were analyzed. RESULTS Patient group A had a lower FA value (P=0.044) and higher ADC value (P=0.004) of the hypothalamus and showed a longer length of hospital stay (P=0.03), lower CRS-R score at discharge (P=0.01), and less change in CRS-R score (P=0.004) compared to patient group B. The improvements in the CRS-R score revealed a moderate negative correlation (r=-0.467) with the severity of the hyponatremia (P=0.004). CONCLUSIONS Post-traumatic hyponatremia was associated with hypothalamic injury and the presence and severity of hyponatremia were associated with poor clinical outcomes in DOC patients.",brain injury
"Detailed statistical analysis plan for a secondary Bayesian analysis of the SafeBoosC-III trial: a multinational, randomised clinical trial assessing treatment guided by cerebral oximetry monitoring versus usual care in extremely preterm infants.","['Markus HarboeOlsen', 'Mathias LührHansen', 'TheisLange', 'ChristianGluud', 'LehanaThabane', 'GormGreisen', 'Janus ChristianJakobsen', 'NoneNone']","Extremely preterm infants have a high mortality and morbidity. Here, we present a statistical analysis plan for secondary Bayesian analyses of the pragmatic, sufficiently powered multinational, trial-SafeBoosC III-evaluating the benefits and harms of cerebral oximetry monitoring plus a treatment guideline versus usual care for such infants.
The SafeBoosC-III trial is an investigator-initiated, open-label, randomised, multinational, pragmatic, phase III clinical trial with a parallel-group design. The trial randomised 1601 infants, and the frequentist analyses were published in April 2023. The primary outcome is a dichotomous composite outcome of death or severe brain injury. The exploratory outcomes are major neonatal morbidities associated with neurodevelopmental impairment later in life: (1) bronchopulmonary dysplasia; (2) retinopathy of prematurity; (3) late-onset sepsis; (4) necrotising enterocolitis; and (5) number of major neonatal morbidities (count of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, and severe brain injury). The primary Bayesian analyses will use non-informed priors including all plausible effects. The models will use a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler with 1 chain, a sampling of 10,000, and at least 25,000 iterations for the burn-in period. In Bayesian statistics, such analyses are referred to as 'posteriors' and will be presented as point estimates with 95% credibility intervals (CrIs), encompassing the most probable results based on the data, model, and priors selected. The results will be presented as probability of any benefit or any harm, Bayes factor, and the probability of clinical important benefit or harm. Two statisticians will analyse the blinded data independently following this protocol.
This statistical analysis plan presents a secondary Bayesian analysis of the SafeBoosC-III trial. The analysis and the final manuscript will be carried out and written after we publicise the primary frequentist trial report. Thus, we can interpret the findings from both the frequentists and Bayesian perspective. This approach should provide a better foundation for interpreting of our findings.

The molecular landscape of neurological disorders: insights from single-cell RNA sequencing in neurology and neurosurgery.,"['Wireko AndrewAwuah', 'ArjunAhluwalia', 'ShankaneelGhosh', 'SakshiRoy', 'Joecelyn KiraniTan', 'Favour TopeAdebusoye', 'TomasFerreira', 'Hareesha RishabBharadwaj', 'VallabhShet', 'MrinmoyKundu', 'Amanda Leong WengYee', 'ToufikAbdul-Rahman', 'OdayAtallah']","Single-cell ribonucleic acid sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged as a transformative technology in neurological and neurosurgical research, revolutionising our comprehension of complex neurological disorders. In brain tumours, scRNA-seq has provided valuable insights into cancer heterogeneity, the tumour microenvironment, treatment resistance, and invasion patterns. It has also elucidated the brain tri-lineage cancer hierarchy and addressed limitations of current models. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have been molecularly subtyped, dysregulated pathways have been identified, and potential therapeutic targets have been revealed using scRNA-seq. In epilepsy, scRNA-seq has explored the cellular and molecular heterogeneity underlying the condition, uncovering unique glial subpopulations and dysregulation of the immune system. ScRNA-seq has characterised distinct cellular constituents and responses to spinal cord injury in spinal cord diseases, as well as provided molecular signatures of various cell types and identified interactions involved in vascular remodelling. Furthermore, scRNA-seq has shed light on the molecular complexities of cerebrovascular diseases, such as stroke, providing insights into specific genes, cell-specific expression patterns, and potential therapeutic interventions. This review highlights the potential of scRNA-seq in guiding precision medicine approaches, identifying clinical biomarkers, and facilitating therapeutic discovery. However, challenges related to data analysis, standardisation, sample acquisition, scalability, and cost-effectiveness need to be addressed. Despite these challenges, scRNA-seq has the potential to transform clinical practice in neurological and neurosurgical research by providing personalised insights and improving patient outcomes.",brain injury
Barriers and enablers to managing challenging behaviours after traumatic brain injury in the acute hospital setting: a qualitative study.,"['HeatherBlock', 'MichelleBellon', 'Sarah CHunter', 'StaceyGeorge']","Challenging behaviours after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the acute setting are associated with risk of harm to the patient and staff, delays in commencing rehabilitation and increased length of hospital stay. Few guidelines exist to inform practice in acute settings, and specialist services providing multi-disciplinary expertise for TBI behaviour management are predominantly based in subacute inpatient services. This study aims to investigate acute and subacute staff perspectives of barriers and enablers to effectively managing challenging behaviours after TBI in acute hospital settings.
Qualitative focus groups were conducted with 28 staff (17 from acute setting, 11 from subacute setting) across two sites who had experience working with patients with TBI. Data were analysed using inductive-deductive reflexive thematic analysis. Data were applied to the constructs of the integrated-Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework to generate themes representing barriers and enablers to managing challenging behaviours after TBI in the acute hospital setting.
Four barriers and three enablers were identified. Barriers include (1) Difficulties with clinical decision making; (2) Concerns for risks to staff and patients; (3) Hospital environment; (4) Intensive resources are required. Enablers were (1) Experienced staff with practical skills; (2) Incorporating person-centred care; and (3) Supportive teams.
These findings can inform pre-implementation planning for future improvements to TBI behaviour management in acute hospital settings. Difficulties with clinical decision making, concerns for risks of injury, the hospital environment and lack of resources are major challenges. Implementation strategies developed to address barriers will need to be trialled, with multi-disciplinary team approaches, and tailored to the acute setting.",brain injury
"Mood, Activity Participation, and Leisure Engagement Satisfaction (MAPLES): results from a randomised controlled pilot feasibility trial for low mood in acquired brain injury.","['AndreaKusec', 'Fionnuala CMurphy', 'Polly VPeers', 'RonBennett', 'EstelaCarmona', 'AleksandraKorbacz', 'CaraLawrence', 'EmmaCameron', 'AndrewBateman', 'PeterWatson', 'JudithAllanson', 'PieterduToit', 'TomManly']","Acquired brain injury (ABI) is linked to increased depression risk. Existing therapies for depression in ABI (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy) have mixed efficacy. Behavioural activation (BA), an intervention that encourages engaging in positively reinforcing activities, shows promise. The primary aims were to assess feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of two 8-week BA groups.
Adults (≥ 18 years) recruited from local ABI services, charities, and self-referral via social media were randomised to condition. The Activity Planning group (AP; ""traditional"" BA) trained participants to plan reinforcing activities over 8 weeks. The Activity Engagement group (AE; ""experiential"" BA) encouraged engagement in positive activities within session only. Both BA groups were compared to an 8-week Waitlist group (WL). The primary outcomes, feasibility and acceptability, were assessed via recruitment, retention, attendance, and qualitative feedback on groups. The secondary outcome, potential efficacy, was assessed via blinded assessments of self-reported activity levels, depression, and anxiety (at pre- and post-intervention and 1 month follow-up) and were compared across trial arms. Data were collected in-person and remotely due to COVID-19.
N = 60 participants were randomised to AP (randomised n = 22; total n = 29), AE (randomised n = 22; total n = 28), or re-randomised following WL (total n = 16). Whether in-person or remote, AP and AE were rated as similarly enjoyable and helpful. In exploring efficacy, 58.33% of AP members had clinically meaningful activity level improvements, relative to 50% AE and 38.5% WL. Both AP and AE groups had depression reductions relative to WL, but only AP participants demonstrated anxiety reductions relative to AE and WL. AP participants noted benefits of learning strategies to increase activities and learning from other group members. AE participants valued social discussion and choice in selecting in-session activities.
Both in-person and remote group BA were feasible and acceptable in ABI. Though both traditional and experiential BA may be effective, these may have different mechanisms.

Prophylactic supplement with melatonin prevented the brain injury after cardiac arrest in rats.,"['YananHu', 'XuyanZhao', 'GeJiang', 'MingxinJin', 'WeiJiang', 'FeiHan']","Prophylactic pharmacotherapy for health care in patients with high risk of cardiac arrest (CA) is an elusive and less explored strategy. Melatonin has possibilities used as a daily nutraceutical to trigger the cellular adaptation. We sought to find the effects of long-term daily prophylactic supplement with melatonin on the victim of CA. Rats were divided into sham, CA, and melatonin + CA (Mel + CA) groups. The rats in the Mel + CA group received daily IP injection of melatonin 100 mg/kg for 14 days. CA was induced by 8 min asphyxia and followed by manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The endpoint was 24 h after resuscitation. Survival, neurological outcome, and hippocampal mitochondrial integrity, dynamics and function were assessed. Survival was significantly higher in the Mel + CA group than the CA group (81 vs. 42%, P = 0.04). Compared to the CA group, neurological damage in the CA1 region and the level of cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-9 in the Mel + CA group were decreased (P < 0.05). Mitochondrial function and integrity were protected in the Mel + CA group compared to the CA group, according to the results of mitochondrial swelling, ΔΨm, ROS production, oxygen consumption rate, and respiratory control rate (P < 0.05). Melatonin increased SIRT3 and downregulated acetylated CypD. The mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy were improved in the Mel + CA group (P < 0.05).

Clinical complications after a traumatic brain injury and its relation with brain biomarkers.,"['OriolYuguero', 'MariaBernal', 'JoanFarré', 'MontserratMartinez-Alonso', 'AnaVena', 'FranciscoPurroy']","We aimed to find out which are the most frequent complications for patients who suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its relation with brain biomarker levels. We conducted a hospital cohort study with patients who attended the Hospital Emergency Department between 1 June 2018 and 31 December 2020. Different variables were collected such as biomarkers levels after 6 h and 12 h of TBI (S100, NSE, UCHL1 and GFAP), clinical and sociodemographic variables, complementary tests, and complications 48 h and 7 days after TBI. Qualitative variables were analysed with Pearson's chi-square test, and quantitative variables with the Mann-Whitney U test. A multivariate logistic regression model for the existence of complications one week after discharge was performed to assess the discriminatory capacity of the clinical variables. A total of 51 controls and 540 patients were included in this study. In the TBI group, the mean age was 83 years, and 53.9% of the patients were male. Complications at seven days were associated with the severity of TBI (p < 0.05) and the number of platelets (p = 0.016). All biomarkers except GFAP showed significant differences in their distribution of values according to gender, with significantly higher values of the three biomarkers for women with respect to men. Patients with complications presented significantly higher S100 values (p < 0.05). The patient's baseline status, the severity of the TBI and the S100 levels can be very important elements in determining whether a patient may develop complications in the few hours after TBI.",brain injury
Study on the Nasal Drug Delivery System of NMD Liposomes In Situ Thermosensitive Gel.,"['LinMa', 'HeYingMao', 'JingXu', 'JingshuPiao', 'MingguanPiao']","Nimodipine (NMD) is a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist that is effective in the prevention and treatment of cerebral arterial vasospasm and cerebral ischemic injury caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage. Since the drug itself is highly insoluble in water and has low oral bioavailability, while injectable formulations may cause pain and inflammation, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents the effective delivery of therapeutic agents to the brain tissue. Therefore, in the present study, NMD liposomes were prepared by ethanol injection and innovatively lyophilised and loaded into temperature-sensitive in situ gels for intranasal administration as sprays to deliver drugs to brain tissues bypassing the blood-brain barrier. The optimal gel formulation was obtained by screening in which liposomes were divided into lecithin, cholesterol, and NMD in the ratio of 40:10: 1; Pluronic P407, Pluronic P188, Tween 80, polyvinyl ketone and ethyl nipagin in the ratio of (180:20:3:1:1); Pluronic P407, Pluronic P188, Tween 80, polyvinyl ketone, and ethyl nipagin in the ratio of (180:20:3:1:1). The prepared flow gel can form a solidified gel after a temperature of 31.07-32.07°C and a time of 58.51-59.89 s. Meanwhile, the NMD liposome gel formulation achieved sustained release over 56 h. The pharmacokinetic results of the developed NMD liposomal temperature-sensitive in situ gel and NMD temperature-sensitive in situ gel showed that liposomal nasal mucosal in situ gel is a more effective brain-targeted drug delivery system for NMD.",brain injury
Risk factors for brain injury in patients with exertional heatstroke: A 5-year experience.,"['LiZhong', 'MingWu', 'Zhe-YingLiu', 'YanLiu', 'Zhi-FengLiu']","Minimal data exist on brain injury in patients with exertional heatstroke (EHS) in developing country. In this study, we explored the risk factors for brain injury induced by EHS 90-day after onset.
A retrospective cohort study of patients with EHS was conducted in the intensive care unit of the General Hospital of Southern Theater Command in China from April 2014 to June 2019. Patients were divided into non-brain injury (fully recovered) and brain injury groups (comprising deceased patients or those with neurological sequelae). The brain injury group was further subdivided into a death group and a sequela group for detailed analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for brain injury after EHS and mortality risk factors for brain injury, and Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to evaluate the effect of the neurological dysfunction on survival.
Out of the 147 EHS patients, 117 were enrolled, of which 96 recovered, 13 (11.1 %) died, and 8 (6.8 %) experienced neurological sequelae. Statistically significant differences were found between non-brain injury and brain injury groups in age, hypotension, duration of consciousness disorders, time to drop core body temperature below 38.5°C, lymphocyte counts, platelet counts, procalcitonin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, cystatin C, coagulation parameters, international normalized ratio, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II scores, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, and Glasgow coma scale scores (all p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (OR = 1.090, 95 % CI: 1.02 - 1.17, p = 0.008), time to drop core temperature (OR = 8.223, 95 % CI: 2.30 - 29.40, p = 0.001), and SOFA scores (OR = 1.676, 95 % CI: 1.29 - 2.18, p < 0.001) are independent risk factors for brain injury induced by EHS. The Kaplan-Meier curves suggest significantly prolonged survival (p < 0.001) in patients with early Glasgow coma scale score > 8 and duration of consciousness disorders ≤ 24 h.
Advanced age, delayed cooling, and higher SOFA scores significantly increase the risk of brain injury post-EHS. These findings underscore the importance of rapid cooling and early assessment of organ failure to improve outcomes in EHS patients.",brain injury
Therapeutic effect of allicin in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage.,"['YaraAtef', 'KeitaKinoshita', 'YuseiIchihara', 'KeisukeUshida', 'YumaHirata', 'YukiKurauchi', 'TakahiroSeki', 'HiroshiKatsuki']","Natural compounds with sulfur moiety produce various biological actions that may be beneficial for the therapies of several devastative disorders of the central nervous system. Here we investigated potential therapeutic effect of allicin, an organosulfur compound derived from garlic, in a mouse model of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) based on intrastriatal collagenase injection. Daily intraperitoneal administration of allicin (50 mg/kg) from 3 h after induction of ICH afforded neuroprotective effects, as evidenced by the increase of surviving neurons in the hematoma, reduction of axonal transport impairment, and prevention of axon tract injury. In addition, allicin inhibited accumulation of activated microglia/macrophages around the hematoma and infiltration of neutrophils within the hematoma. Allicin also suppressed ICH-induced mRNA upregulation of pro-inflammatory factors such as interleukin 6 and C-X-C motif ligand 2 in the brain, suggesting its anti-inflammatory effect. Moreover, ICH-induced increase of malondialdehyde as well as decrease of total glutathione in the brain was attenuated by allicin. Finally, allicin-treated mice showed better recovery of sensorimotor functions after ICH than vehicle-treated mice. These results indicate that allicin produces a therapeutic effect on ICH pathology via alleviation of neuronal damage, inflammatory responses and oxidative stress in the brain.",brain injury
Total-body irradiation alters white matter volume and microstructural integrity in rhesus macaques.,"['Brendan JJohnson', 'Richard ABarcus', 'John DOlson', 'Megan ELipford', 'Rachel NAndrews', 'Greg ODugan', 'Janet ATooze', 'JeongchulKim', 'SimonDeycmar', 'Christopher TWhitlow', 'J MarkCline']","Long-term survivors of brain irradiation can suffer from irreversible injury and cognitive impairment. T1-weighted and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging are used to evaluate brain volumes and white matter (WM) microstructure in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions. The goal of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of single-dose total-body irradiation (TBI) or TBI with 5% partial-body sparing on brain volumetrics and WM integrity in macaques.
We utilized MRI scans from a cohort of male rhesus macaques (age range: 3.6-22.8 years), to compare global and regional brain volumes and WM diffusion in survivors of TBI (T1w: n=137, DTI: n=121, dose range: 3.5-10 Gy) against unirradiated controls (T1w: n=48, DTI: n=38).
In all ROIs, radiation affected the age-related changes in fractional anisotropy (FA); in general, FA increased across age in both groups, but to a lesser extent in the irradiated group (interaction p-values <0.01). Depending on the ROI, mean diffusivity (MD) decreased or remained the same across age in unirradiated animals, while it increased or did not change in irradiated animals. The increases in MD were driven by changes in radial diffusivity (RD) which followed similar trends across age. Axial diffusivity (AD) did not differ by irradiation status. Age-related changes in relative volumes in controls reflected normal trends in humans with increasing WM and decreasing gray matter (GM) until middle age. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume did not differ across age in controls. WM volume was lower and CSF volume was higher in young, irradiated macaques. WM volume was similar between groups and CSF volume reduced in older irradiated macaques. GM volume was unaffected by radiation.
TBI results in delayed WM expansion and long-term disruption of WM integrity. Diffusion changes suggest that myelin injury in WM is a hallmark of late-delayed radiation induced brain injury.",brain injury
Mood assessments of family caregivers of patients with severe brain injury in China.,"['YifanYan', 'MeiqiLi', 'TiantianCai', 'XueyingWang', 'YanDong', 'XiaohuaHu', 'StevenLaureys', 'OliviaGosseries', 'CharlotteGrégoire', 'HaiboDi']","Long-term care of severe brain injury patients places a significant mental burden on family caregivers, yet few studies have reported the situation in China. We aimed to describe the mood states of family caregivers of patients with severe brain injury and examine the influencing factors that affect caregivers' moods.
Cross-sectional survey was used to assess the mood profiles of Chinese family caregivers between February 2019 and February 2020. Demographic data of caregivers and patients, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) were used to assess the level of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The quality of life score was also assessed by a visual analog scale, and the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised was used to assess the patient's consciousness.
One hundred and one patients with severe brain injury (57 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, UWS) between the age of 14 and 70 and their main family caregivers were enrolled in the study. Most caregivers displayed depressive (n = 62) and anxiety symptoms (n = 65), with 17 and 20 of these family caregivers reporting (moderately) severe depressive symptom and severe anxiety symptom, respectively. The caregiver's depressive symptom level significantly decreased as the patient's injury lasted longer (r =  - 0.208, P = 0.037). Moreover, the age of the patient negatively related to the levels of depressive (r =  - 0.310, P = 0.002) and anxiety symptoms (r =  - 0.289, P = 0.003) in caregivers. There was a significant positive correlation between anxiety and depressive symptoms scores in family caregivers (r = 0.838, P < 0.001). The higher the level of anxiety (r =  - 0.273, P = 0.006) and depressive symptoms (r =  - 0.265, P = 0.007), the worse the quality of life.
Many family caregivers of patients with severe brain injury experience various levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in China. Tailor-made psychological help seems imperative. Researchers and doctors can provide information about patient's conditions to assist family members in discussing rehabilitation options for patients in different states of consciousness will help to ease anxiety of family caregivers.",brain injury
Molecular Mechanism by Which TRPC6 Regulates Calcium Signaling and Neuroinflammation in the Onset and Development of Ischemic Stroke: A Review.,"['WenbinLi', 'YidanZhang', 'FanYang', 'LeiZhang']","Cerebral infarction, also known as ischemic stroke, is caused by various regional blood supply disorders in the brain tissue, leading to ischemic hypoxic lesions and necrosis of the brain tissue and then the corresponding clinical manifestations of neurological loss, which has high mortality and disability. This study comprehensively reviews the potential molecular mechanisms of TRPC6 in neuroprotection in cerebral infarction and provides a summary of TRPC6 as a targeted drug or prognostic biomarker for cerebral infarction patients. We will screen and synthesize evidence about the molecular mechanisms of TRPC6 in cerebral infarction from the current literature to obtain comprehensive knowledge on this topic. In the pathogenesis, neuroinflammation and intracellular calcium accumulation play an important role in the onset and development of cerebral infarction. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily C6 (TRPC6) is the main component of calcium store-operated calcium channels. It plays a central role in ischemic cerebrovascular disease by mediating the calcium ion signaling pathway. In this review, evidence on the neuroprotective effects of TRPC6 has been shown, including inhibiting neuroinflammation and inhibiting nerve cell apoptosis, thereby alleviating nerve injury. However, at the same time, TRPC6 promotes inflammation in other organs. Generally, although an increasing number of researches support the protective role of TRPC6 in cerebral infarction, there is still evidence showing that overexpression of TRPC6 increases inflammatory tissue damage in other organs. Therefore, clarifying the molecular mechanism of TRPC6 will help develop targeted drugs or prognostic biomarkers for cerebral infarction to promote and predict neurological function recovery. More evidence to elucidate the molecular mechanism of TRPC6 in cerebral infarction is needed. Enriching TRPC6 in neuroinflammation areas and modifying its cell specificity might be the orientation of drug development that increases the effect of stroke treatment and reduces the impact on other organs. In conclusion, in cerebral infarction, TRPC6 has been proven to alleviate neuroinflammation and inhibit nerve cell apoptosis. However, at the same time, TRPC6 may promote inflammation in other organs. Therefore, the targeting potential of TRPC6 in cerebral infarction needs to be further explored.",brain injury

This study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of the challenges faced by brain injury survivors during the first year of the pandemic and how community brain injury associations adapted their services to respond to these needs. Findings from seven focus-group with 31 representatives of Canadian brain injury associations revealed 4 main themes: (1) Addressing evolving client needs; (2) Keeping clients safe; (3) Challenges and opportunities navigating the digital world; and (4) Sustaining brain injury associations in the face of uncertainties and disruptions. To comply with public health measures, associations reported pivoting their service delivery online, despite recognizing the difficulties this could create for many brain injury survivors in accessing and using technology. Our findings also highlight concrete directions for not-profit organizations providing instrumental help with activities, acting as a liaison and interpreter of public health guidelines, and in connecting with clients using technology while handling potential cognitive and technological challenges. Addressing these issues has the potential to protect people living with brain injury and community associations from external threats, like pandemics, in the future.",brain injury
Family experiences of the management of challenging behaviours after traumatic brain injury in the acute hospital setting.,"['HeatherBlock', 'StaceyGeorge', 'Sarah CHunter', 'MichelleBellon']","This study explored experiences of the management of challenging behaviours after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the acute hospital setting from the perspectives of family members.
A qualitative, interpretive phenomenological approach was adopted involving semi-structured interviews with 10 family members. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis, with Ecological Systems Theory applied as a guiding framework to discuss findings and implications for practice.
Four primary themes were identified: 1) The hospital environment; 2) Hospital staffing; 3) Identifying and preventing triggers, and 4) Family support and information.
This qualitative study highlights the need for further information, education, and support to families of patients with TBI in the acute setting. Further research investigating the implementation of best practice approaches for managing challenging behaviours practice in acute settings is needed to overcome the barriers of the hospital environment, inexperienced and inconsistent staffing, and difficulties identifying triggers within the acute hospital setting, experienced by families. Approaches for family involvement in behaviour management strategies, and facilitation of communication for people with TBI in the acute setting requires exploration.
Families reported the hospital environment, inexperienced and inconsistent staffing, and difficulty identifying triggers were challenges in effectively managing challenging behaviours after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the acute setting.Clinicians can support family involvement in preventative strategies with patients with TBI.Clinicians can enable quality of care by building rapport and providing compassionate care to patients with TBI.Families need more support and information during the acute stage of TBI in hospital settings.",brain injury

Mortality rates in this population decreased over time due to developments in technology and effective treatment modalities.
This retrospective cohort study aimed to describe the volume, severity and mechanism of all hospital-admitted pediatric TBI patients at a university hospital over a 5-year period.
This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study including 90 pediatric patients with TBI admitted to a tertiary care PICU. The patients' demographic data, injury mechanisms, disease and trauma severity scores, initiation of enteral nutrition and outcome measures such as hospital stay, PICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, mortality, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) were also recorded. Late enteral nutrition was defined as initiation of enteral feeding after 48 hours of hospitalization.
Of the 90 patients included in the cohort, 60% had mild TBI, 21.1% had moderate TBI and 18.9% had severe TBI. Their mean age was 69 months (3-210 months). TBI was isolated in 34 (37.8%) patients and observed as a part of multisystemic trauma in 56 (62.2%). The most commonly involved site in multisystemic injury was the thorax (33.3%). The length of hospitalization in the late enteral nutrition group was significantly higher than that in the early nutrition group, while the PICU stay was not significantly different between the two groups. The multiple logistic regression analysis found a significant relationship between GOS-3rd month and PIM3 score, the presence of diffuse axonal injury and the need for CPR in the first 24 h of hospitalization.
Although our study showed that delayed enteral nutrition did not affect neurologic outcome, it may lead to prolonged hospitalization and increased hospital costs. High PIM3 scores and diffuse axonal injury are both associated with worse neurologic outcomes.",brain injury

A number of mutations in the microglial protein triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been associated with increased risk for developing AD, most notably the R47H/+ substitution. We employed gene editing and stem cell models to gain insight into the effects of the TREM2 R47H/+ mutation on human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia. We found transcriptional changes affecting numerous cellular processes, with R47H/+ cells exhibiting a proinflammatory gene expression signature. TREM2 R47H/+ also caused impairments in microglial movement and the uptake of multiple substrates, as well as rendering microglia hyperresponsive to inflammatory stimuli. We developed an in vitro laser-induced injury model in neuron-microglia cocultures, finding an impaired injury response by TREM2 R47H/+ microglia. Furthermore, mouse brains transplanted with TREM2 R47H/+ microglia exhibited reduced synaptic density, with upregulation of multiple complement cascade components in TREM2 R47H/+ microglia suggesting inappropriate synaptic pruning as one potential mechanism. These findings identify a number of potentially detrimental effects of the TREM2 R47H/+ mutation on microglial gene expression and function likely to underlie its association with AD.",brain injury

Due to the initial asymptomatic liver involvement, the progression of liver injuries in WD stays primarily unknown. Atp7b-/- knockout mice have been shown to be an appropriate model of WD for liver involvement.
A total of 138 Atp7b-/- mice were included and separated into five groups according to age as follows: 6, 20, 39 and 50 weeks without treatment, and 50 weeks with copper chelator treatment from 39 to 50 weeks of age and compared with 101 wild-type (WT) mice at the same stages. The evolution of histological liver lesions was analysed and compared between groups.
Significant changes were observed in Atp7b-/- mice compared with WT. Copper deposits in hepatocytes appeared as early as 6 weeks but no significant increase over time was observed. Inflammation appeared as early as 6 weeks and progressed henceforth. Lobular and periportal acidophilic bodies appeared after 20 weeks. Significant atypia was also observed at 20 weeks and increased over time to reach a severe stage at 39 weeks. Fibrosis also became apparent at 20 weeks, progressing subsequently to precirrhotic stages at 50 weeks. Copper content, inflammation and fibrosis scores were significantly reduced in the treated group. No bile duct lesions or dysplastic changes were noted.

This study aimed to establish a rat model of HIE and transplant hPMSCs through the lateral ventricle after hypoxic-ishcemic (HI) brain damage to observe its protective effects and mechanisms, with a focus on brain apoptosis compared among groups. Differentially expressed apoptosis-related proteins were screened using a rat cytokine array and subsequent verification. Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) and Semaphorin 3A (Sema 3A) were selected for further investigation. Western blotting was used to quantify the expression of Sema 3A and the proteins related to PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Exogenous Sema 3A was added to evaluate the effects of Sema 3A/NRP-1 on hPMSCs following HI injury. hPMSCs transplantation ameliorated HI-induced pathological changes, reduced apoptosis, and improved long-term neurological prognosis. Furthermore, Sema 3A/NRP-1 was a key regulator in reducing HI-induced apoptosis after hPMSCs transplantation. hPMSCs inhibited the expression of Sema 3A/NRP-1 and activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Additionally, exogenous Sema 3A abolished the protective effects of hPMSCs against HI. In conclusion, hPMSCs transplantation reduced apoptosis and improved long-term neurological prognosis after HI by downregulating Sema 3A/NRP-1 expression and activating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.",brain injury
Single-cell transcriptomics of human traumatic brain injury reveals activation of endogenous retroviruses in oligodendroglia.,"['RaquelGarza', 'YogitaSharma', 'Diahann A MAtacho', 'ArunThiruvalluvan', 'SamiAbu Hamdeh', 'Marie EJönsson', 'VivienHorvath', 'AnitaAdami', 'MartinIngelsson', 'PatricJern', 'Molly GaleHammell', 'ElisabetEnglund', 'AgneteKirkeby', 'JohanJakobsson', 'NiklasMarklund']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of chronic brain impairment and results in a robust, but poorly understood, neuroinflammatory response that contributes to the long-term pathology. We used single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to study transcriptomic changes in different cell populations in human brain tissue obtained acutely after severe, life-threatening TBI. This revealed a unique transcriptional response in oligodendrocyte precursors and mature oligodendrocytes, including the activation of a robust innate immune response, indicating an important role for oligodendroglia in the initiation of neuroinflammation. The activation of an innate immune response correlated with transcriptional upregulation of endogenous retroviruses in oligodendroglia. This observation was causally linked in vitro using human glial progenitors, implicating these ancient viral sequences in human neuroinflammation. In summary, this work provides insight into the initiating events of the neuroinflammatory response in TBI, which has therapeutic implications.",brain injury
Fingerprint of Circulating Immunocytes as Biomarkers for the Prognosis of Brain Inflammation and Neuronal Injury after Cardiac Arrest.,"['HuanyuDou', 'Nicole RBrandon', 'Kerryann EKoper', 'YanXu']","Cardiac arrest is one of the most dangerous health problems in the world. Outcome prognosis is largely based on cerebral performance categories determined by neurological evaluations. Few systemic tests are currently available to predict survival to hospital discharge. Here, we present the results from the preclinical studies of cardiac arrest and resuscitation (CAR) in mice to identify signatures of circulating immune cells as blood-derived biomarkers to predict outcomes after CAR.

Window into the mind: Advanced handheld spectroscopic eye-safe technology for point-of-care neurodiagnostic.,"['CarlBanbury', 'GeorgiaHarris', 'MichaelClancy', 'Richard JBlanch', 'Jonathan James StanleyRickard', 'PolaGoldberg Oppenheimer']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, is hard to diagnose at the point of care with patients often exhibiting no clinical symptoms. There is an urgent need for rapid point-of-care diagnostics to enable timely intervention. We have developed a technology for rapid acquisition of molecular fingerprints of TBI biochemistry to safely measure proxies for cerebral injury through the eye, providing a path toward noninvasive point-of-care neurodiagnostics using simultaneous Raman spectroscopy and fundus imaging of the neuroretina. Detection of endogenous neuromarkers in porcine eyes' posterior revealed enhancement of high-wave number bands, clearly distinguishing TBI and healthy cohorts, classified via artificial neural network algorithm for automated data interpretation. Clinically, translating into reduced specialist support, this markedly improves the speed of diagnosis. Designed as a hand-held cost-effective technology, it can allow clinicians to rapidly assess TBI at the point of care and identify long-term changes in brain biochemistry in acute or chronic neurodiseases.",brain injury
Single-cell analysis reveals distinct fibroblast plasticity during tenocyte regeneration in zebrafish.,"['Arsheen MRajan', 'Nicole LRosin', 'ElodieLabit', 'JeffBiernaskie', 'ShanLiao', 'PengHuang']","Despite their importance in tissue maintenance and repair, fibroblast diversity and plasticity remain poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we uncover distinct sclerotome-derived fibroblast populations in zebrafish, including progenitor-like perivascular/interstitial fibroblasts, and specialized fibroblasts such as tenocytes. To determine fibroblast plasticity in vivo, we develop a laser-induced tendon ablation and regeneration model. Lineage tracing reveals that laser-ablated tenocytes are quickly regenerated by preexisting fibroblasts. By combining single-cell clonal analysis and live imaging, we demonstrate that perivascular/interstitial fibroblasts actively migrate to the injury site, where they proliferate and give rise to new tenocytes. By contrast, perivascular fibroblast-derived pericytes or specialized fibroblasts, including tenocytes, exhibit no regenerative plasticity. Active Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is required for the proliferation of activated fibroblasts to ensure efficient tenocyte regeneration. Together, our work highlights the functional diversity of fibroblasts and establishes perivascular/interstitial fibroblasts as tenocyte progenitors that promote tendon regeneration in a Hh signaling-dependent manner.",brain injury

However, less is known about the association of TBI with cerebellar structure and how such changes may alter executive functioning.
To investigate alterations in subregional cerebellum volume and cerebral white matter microstructure after pediatric TBI and examine subsequent changes in executive function.
This retrospective cohort study combined 12 data sets (collected between 2006 and 2020) from 9 sites in the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics Through Meta-Analysis Consortium Pediatric TBI working group in a mega-analysis of cerebellar structure. Participants with TBI or healthy controls (some with orthopedic injury) were recruited from trauma centers, clinics, and institutional trauma registries, some of which were followed longitudinally over a period of 0.7 to 1.9 years. Healthy controls were recruited from the surrounding community. Data analysis occurred from October to December 2022.
Accidental mild complicated-severe TBI (msTBI) for those in the TBI group. Some controls received a diagnosis of orthopedic injury.
Volume of 18 cerebellar lobules and vermal regions were estimated from 3-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. White matter organization in 28 regions of interest was assessed with diffusion tensor MRI. Executive function was measured by parent-reported scores from the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning.
A total of 598 children and adolescents (mean [SD] age, 14.05 [3.06] years; range, 5.45-19.70 years; 386 male participants [64.5%]; 212 female participants [35.5%]) were included in the study, with 314 participants in the msTBI group, and 284 participants in the non-TBI group (133 healthy individuals and 151 orthopedically injured individuals). Significantly smaller total cerebellum volume (d = -0.37; 95% CI, -0.52 to -0.22; P < .001) and subregional cerebellum volumes (eg, corpus medullare; d = -0.43; 95% CI, -0.58 to -0.28; P < .001) were observed in the msTBI group. These alterations were primarily seen in participants in the chronic phase (ie, >6 months postinjury) of injury (total cerebellar volume, d = -0.55; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.35; P < .001). Smaller cerebellum volumes were associated with higher scores on the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning Global Executive Composite score (β = -208.9 mm3; 95% CI, -319.0 to -98.0 mm3; P = .008) and Metacognition Index score (β = -202.5 mm3; 95% CI, -319.0 to -85.0 mm3; P = .02). In a subset of 185 participants with longitudinal data, younger msTBI participants exhibited cerebellum volume reductions (β = 0.0052 mm3; 95% CI, 0.0013 to 0.0090 mm3; P = .01), and older participants slower growth rates. Poorer white matter organization in the first months postinjury was associated with decreases in cerebellum volume over time (β=0.52 mm3; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.84 mm3; P = .005).
In this cohort study of pediatric msTBI, our results demonstrated robust cerebellar volume alterations associated with pediatric TBI, localized to the posterior lobe. Furthermore, longitudinal cerebellum changes were associated with baseline diffusion tensor MRI metrics, suggesting secondary cerebellar atrophy. These results provide further understanding of secondary injury mechanisms and may point to new opportunities for intervention.",brain injury

Neural Stem Cell Extracellular Vesicles Carrying YBX1 Inhibited Neuronal Pyroptosis Through Increasing m6A-modified GPR30 Stability and Expression in Ischemic Stroke.,"['JunPeng', 'JunHe', 'LongLin', 'YouLi', 'YingXia']","Neural stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (NSC-derived EVs) alleviated ischemic stroke (IS) by suppressing the activation of nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeats family protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and neuronal pyroptosis. However, the specific mechanism needs further investigation. qRT-qPCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence detected related gene expression. Immunofluorescent analyzed the expression of Ki-67, βIII-Tubulin (Tuj1), and GFAP. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and IL-1β and IL-18 levels were analyzed by LDH and ELISA kits. TTC staining evaluated the infarction of brain tissues. Flow cytometric analysis measured caspase-1 activity. M6A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation PCR (MeRIP-PCR) measured methylation levels of G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30). RIP and Co-IP analyzed the interactions of Y box binding protein (YBX1)/GPR30, YBX1/IGF2BP1 and NLRP3/speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), as well as the ubiquitination levels of NLRP3. NSC-derived EVs inhibited the ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury of rats and the neuronal pyroptosis induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Knockdown of EVs carrying YBX1 or GPR30 silencing abolished these inhibiting effects. GPR30 mRNA and IGF2BP1 protein were enriched by YBX1 antibody. YBX1 enhanced the stability of m6A-modified GPR30 by interacting with IGF2BP1 and thus promoting GPR30 expression. Knockdown of IGF2BP1 suppressed the binding between YBX1 and GPR30 mRNA. GPR30 promoted NLRP3 ubiquitination by interacting with SPOP. EVs carrying YBX1 could reduce the infarction of brain tissues and inhibit neuronal pyroptosis in rats with I/R injury. NSC-derived EVs carrying YBX1 increased the stability of m6A-modified GPR30 by interacting with IGF2BP1; the upregulation of GPR30 inhibited the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome through promoting NLRP3 ubiquitination by SPOP, ultimately suppressing the neuronal pyroptosis in IS.",brain injury
Adrenergic receptors blockade alleviates dexamethasone-induced neurotoxicity in adult male Wistar rats: Distinct effects on β-arrestin2 expression and molecular markers of neural injury.,"['Rasha M S MMohamed', 'EnssafAhmad Ahmad', 'Dalia MAmin', 'Samar AhmedAbdo', 'Islam A A E-HIbrahim', 'Mona FMahmoud', 'ShimaaAbdelaal']","Dexamethasone-induced neurotoxicity has been previously reported. However, the molecular mechanisms are still not completely understood.
The current work aimed to investigate the modulatory effects of α- and β-adrenergic receptors on dexamethasone-induced neurotoxicity in rats focused on changes in β-arrestin2 and molecular markers of neural injury in cerebral cortex.
Male Wistar rats were subcutaneously injected with dexamethasone (10 mg/kg/day) for 7 days to induce neural injury in the cerebral cortex. The experiment involved 5 groups: control, dexamethasone, carvedilol, propranolol, and doxazosin. In the last 3 groups, drugs were given 2 hours before dexamethasone injection. At the end of experiment, brain samples were collected for measurement of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), kinase activity of protein kinase B (Akt), diacylglycerol (DAG), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), Smad3, β-amyloid and phospho-tau protein levels in addition to histopathological examination of brain tissue using hematoxylin-eosin, Nissl, and Sirius red stains. Moreover, β-arrestin2 levels in the cerebral cortex were measured using immunohistochemical examination.
Dexamethasone slightly reduced brain weight and significantly decreased BDNF, Akt kinase activity and β-arrestin2 but markedly induced degeneration of cortical neurons and significantly increased GFAP, DAG, α-SMA, Smad3, β-amyloid and phospho-tau protein levels compared to controls. Carvedilol, propranolol, and doxazosin reversed all dexamethasone-induced molecular changes and slightly ameliorated the histopathological changes. Carvedilol significantly increased brain weight and β-arrestin2 levels compared to dexamethasone, propranolol, and doxazosin groups.

Neuropsychological Correlates of PTSD and Depressive Symptom Improvement in Compensatory Cognitive Training for Veterans With a History of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"['Jillian M RClark', 'Amber VKeller', 'Jacqueline EMaye', 'Amy JJak', ""Maya EO'Neil"", 'Rhonda MWilliams', 'Aaron PTurner', 'Kathleen FPagulayan', 'Elizabeth WTwamley']","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), depression, and PTSD are highly prevalent in post-9/11 veterans. With the comorbidity of depression and PTSD in post-9/11 veterans with mTBI histories and their role in exacerbating cognitive and emotional dysfunction, interventions addressing cognitive and psychiatric functioning are critical. Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) is associated with improvements in prospective memory, attention, and executive functioning and has also yielded small-to-medium treatment effects on PTSD and depressive symptom severity. We sought to examine neuropsychological correlates of PTSD and depressive symptom improvement in veterans with a history of mTBI who received CCT.
Thirty-seven post-9/11 veterans with mTBI histories and cognitive complaints received 10 weekly 120-minute CCT group sessions. Participants completed a baseline neuropsychological assessment, including tests of premorbid functioning, attention/working memory, processing speed, verbal learning/memory, and executive functioning, and completed psychiatric symptom measures (PTSD and depression) at baseline, post-treatment, and a 5-week follow-up. Paired samples t-tests were used to examine statistically significant changes in PTSD (total and symptom cluster scores) and depressive symptom scores over time. Pearson's correlations were calculated between neuropsychological scores and PTSD and depressive symptom change scores at post-treatment and follow-up. Neuropsychological measures identified as significantly correlated with psychiatric symptom change scores were entered as independent variables in multivariable regression analyses to examine their association with symptom change at post-treatment and follow-up.
Over 50% of CCT participants had clinically meaningful improvement in depressive symptoms (≥17.5% score reduction), and over 20% had clinically meaningful improvement in PTSD symptoms (≥10-point improvement) at post-treatment and follow-up. Examination of PTSD symptom cluster scores revealed a statistically significant improvement in avoidance/numbing at follow-up. Bivariate correlations indicated that worse baseline performance on Category Fluency was moderately associated with PTSD symptom improvement at post-treatment. Worse performance on both Category Fluency and Category Switching Accuracy was associated with improvement in depressive symptoms at post-treatment and follow-up. Worse performance on Trail-Making Number-Letter Switching was also associated with improvement in depressive symptoms at follow-up. Subsequent regression analyses revealed that worse processing speed and worse aspects of executive functioning at baseline were associated with depressive symptom improvement at post-treatment and follow-up.
Worse baseline performances on tests of processing speed and aspects of executive functioning were significantly associated with improvements in PTSD and depressive symptoms during the trial. Our results suggest that cognitive training may bolster skills that are helpful for PTSD and depressive symptom reduction and that those with worse baseline functioning may benefit more from treatment because they have more room to improve.",brain injury
Scenario Decision-Making About Plasma and Platelet Transfusion for Intracranial Monitor Placement: Cross-Sectional Survey of Pediatric Intensivists and Neurosurgeons.,"['Marianne ENellis', 'OliverKaram', 'GuillermoAldave', 'Brandon GRocque', 'David FBauer', 'NoneNone']","To report pediatric intensivists' and pediatric neurosurgeons' responses to case-based scenarios about plasma and platelet transfusions before intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placement in children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Survey administered through the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators and the American Association of Neurologic Surgeons.
Pediatric intensivists and pediatric neurosurgeons.
None.
A total of 184 participants responded (85 identified as pediatric intensivists and 54 as pediatric neurosurgeons). In all eight scenarios, the majority of respondents reported that they would base their decision-making about plasma transfusion on international normalized ratio (INR) alone (60-69%), or platelet transfusion on platelet count alone (83-86%). Pediatric intensivists, as opposed to pediatric neurosurgeons, more frequently reported that they would have used viscoelastic testing in their consideration of plasma transfusion (32% vs. 7%, p < 0.001), as well as to guide platelet transfusions (29 vs. 8%, p < 0.001), for the case-based scenarios. For all relevant case-based scenarios, pediatric neurosurgeons in comparison with pediatric reported that they would use a lower median (interquartile range [IQR]) INR threshold for plasma transfusion (1.5 [IQR 1.4-1.7] vs. 2.0 [IQR 1.5-2.0], p < 0.001). Overall, in all respondents, the reported median platelet count threshold for platelet transfusion in the case-based scenario was 100 (IQR 50-100) ×109/L, with no difference between specialties.
Despite little evidence showing efficacy, when we tested specialists' decision-making, we found that they reported using INR and platelet count in pediatric case-based scenarios of TBI undergoing ICP monitor placement. We also found that pediatric intensivists and pediatric neurosurgeons had differences in decision-making about the scenarios.",brain injury

Using propensity-weighted models, we examined the association of early dexmedetomidine exposure (within the first 5 d of ICU admission) with the primary outcome of 6-month Glasgow Outcomes Scale Extended (GOS-E) and the following secondary outcomes: length of hospital stay, hospital mortality, 6-month Disability Rating Scale (DRS), and 6-month mortality. The study population included 352 subjects who required mechanical ventilation within 24 hours of admission. The initial sedative medication was propofol for 240 patients (68%), midazolam for 59 patients (17%), ketamine for 6 patients (2%), dexmedetomidine for 3 patients (1%), and 43 patients (12%) never received continuous sedation. Early dexmedetomidine was administered in 77 of the patients (22%), usually as a second-line agent. Compared with unexposed patients, early dexmedetomidine exposure was not associated with better 6-month GOS-E (weighted odds ratio [OR] = 1.48; 95% CI, 0.98-2.25). Early dexmedetomidine exposure was associated with lower DRS (weighted OR = -3.04; 95% CI, -5.88 to -0.21). In patients requiring ICP monitoring within the first 24 hours of admission, early dexmedetomidine exposure was associated with higher 6-month GOS-E score (OR 2.17; 95% CI, 1.24-3.80), lower DRS score (adjusted mean difference, -5.81; 95% CI, -9.38 to 2.25), and reduced length of hospital stay (hazard ratio = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.02-2.20).
Variation exists in early sedation choice among mechanically ventilated patients with msTBI.

However, how this occurs after stroke, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, remains unknown. Here, we report that HSD impairs long-term brain recovery after intracerebral hemorrhage, a severe form of stroke, despite salt withdrawal prior to the injury. Mechanistically, HSD induces innate immune priming and training in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) by downregulation of NR4a family and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. This training compromises alternative activation of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) without altering the initial inflammatory responses of the stroke brain. Healthy mice transplanted with bone marrow from HSD-fed mice retain signatures of reduced MDM reparative functions, further confirming a persistent form of innate immune memory that originates in the bone marrow. Loss of NR4a1 in macrophages recapitulates HSD-induced negative impacts on stroke outcomes while gain of NR4a1 enables stroke recovery in HSD animals. Together, we provide the first evidence that links HSD-induced innate immune memory to the acquisition of persistent dysregulated inflammatory responses and unveils NR4a1 as a potential therapeutic target.",brain injury

Given similarities in presentation with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), we used the latter as a clinically relevant means of evaluating if the neuropsychological profiles observed in Havana Syndrome Havana Syndrome might be explained at least in part by a dysregulation of neurotransmission, neuro-inflammation, or both.
Automated text-mining of >9,000 publications produced a network consisting of 273 documented regulatory interactions linking 29 neuro-chemical markers with 9 neuropsychological constructs from the Brief Mood Survey, PTSD Checklist, and the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale. Analysis of information flow through this network produced a set of regulatory rules reconciling to within a 6% departure known mechanistic pathways with neuropsychological profiles in

Adolescent traumatic brain injury leads to incremental neural impairment in middle-aged mice: role of persistent oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.,"['ZiyuanChen', 'PengfeiWang', 'HaoCheng', 'NingWang', 'MingzheWu', 'ZiweiWang', 'ZhiWang', 'WenwenDong', 'DaweiGuan', 'LinlinWang', 'RuiZhao']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases the risk of mental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases in the chronic phase. However, there is limited neuropathological or molecular data on the long-term neural dysfunction and its potential mechanism following adolescent TBI.
A total of 160 male mice aged 8 weeks were used to mimic moderate TBI by controlled cortical impact. At 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-injury (mpi), different neurological functions were evaluated by elevated plus maze, forced swimming test, sucrose preference test and Morris water maze. The levels of oxidative stress, antioxidant response, reactive astrocytes and microglia, and expression of inflammatory cytokines were subsequently assessed in the ipsilateral hippocampus, followed by neuronal apoptosis detection. Additionally, the morphological complexity of hippocampal astrocytes was evaluated by Sholl analysis.
The adolescent mice exhibited persistent and incremental deficits in memory and anxiety-like behavior after TBI, which were sharply exacerbated at 12 mpi. Depression-like behaviors were observed in TBI mice at 6 mpi and 12 mpi. Compared with the age-matched control mice, apoptotic neurons were observed in the ipsilateral hippocampus during the chronic phase of TBI, which were accompanied by enhanced oxidative stress, and expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-α). Moreover, the reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis in the ipsilateral hippocampus were observed in the late phase of TBI, especially at 12 mpi.
Adolescent TBI leads to incremental cognitive dysfunction, and depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in middle-aged mice. The chronic persistent neuroinflammation and oxidative stress account for the neuronal loss and neural dysfunction in the ipsilateral hippocampus. Our results provide evidence for the pathogenesis of chronic neural damage following TBI and shed new light on the treatment of TBI-induced late-phase neurological dysfunction.",brain injury

Proteomic analysis of peripheral nerve myelin during murine aging.,"['Dario LucasHelbing', 'Joanna MKirkpatrick', 'MichaelReuter', 'JuliaBischoff', 'AmyStockdale', 'AnnemarieCarlstedt', 'EmilioCirri', 'ReinhardBauer', 'HelenMorrison']","Aging of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is associated with structural and functional changes that lead to a reduction in regenerative capacity and the development of age-related peripheral neuropathy. Myelin is central to maintaining physiological peripheral nerve function and differences in myelin maintenance, degradation, formation and clearance have been suggested to contribute to age-related PNS changes. Recent proteomic studies have elucidated the complex composition of the total myelin proteome in health and its changes in neuropathy models. However, changes in the myelin proteome of peripheral nerves during aging have not been investigated. Here we show that the proteomes of myelin fractions isolated from young and old nerves show only subtle changes. In particular, we found that the three most abundant peripheral myelin proteins (MPZ, MBP, and PRX) do not change in old myelin fractions. We also show a tendency for high-abundance myelin proteins other than these three to be downregulated, with only a small number of ribosome-related proteins significantly downregulated and extracellular matrix proteins such as collagens upregulated. In addition, we illustrate that the peripheral nerve myelin proteome reported in this study is suitable for assessing myelin degradation and renewal during peripheral nerve degeneration and regeneration. Our results suggest that the peripheral nerve myelin proteome is relatively stable and undergoes only subtle changes in composition during mouse aging. We proffer the resultant dataset as a resource and starting point for future studies aimed at investigating peripheral nerve myelin during aging. Said datasets are available in the PRIDE archive under the identifier PXD040719 (aging myelin proteome) and PXD041026 (sciatic nerve injury proteome).",brain injury
Microglia-neuron-vascular interactions in ischemia.,"['NikolettLénárt', 'CsabaCserép', 'EszterCsászár', 'BalázsPósfai', 'ÁdámDénes']","Cerebral ischemia is a devastating condition that results in impaired blood flow in the brain leading to acute brain injury. As the most common form of stroke, occlusion of cerebral arteries leads to a characteristic sequence of pathophysiological changes in the brain tissue. The mechanisms involved, and comorbidities that determine outcome after an ischemic event appear to be highly heterogeneous. On their own, the processes leading to neuronal injury in the absence of sufficient blood supply to meet the metabolic demand of the cells are complex and manifest at different temporal and spatial scales. While the contribution of non-neuronal cells to stroke pathophysiology is increasingly recognized, recent data show that microglia, the main immune cells of the central nervous system parenchyma, play previously unrecognized roles in basic physiological processes beyond their inflammatory functions, which markedly change during ischemic conditions. In this review, we aim to discuss some of the known microglia-neuron-vascular interactions assumed to contribute to the acute and delayed pathologies after cerebral ischemia. Because the mechanisms of neuronal injury have been extensively discussed in several excellent previous reviews, here we focus on some recently explored pathways that may directly or indirectly shape neuronal injury through microglia-related actions. These discoveries suggest that modulating gliovascular processes in different forms of stroke and other neurological disorders might have presently unexplored therapeutic potential in combination with neuroprotective and flow restoration strategies.",brain injury
Cauda equina syndrome in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus and secondary central nervous system lymphoma: a case report.,"['AlexanderTang', 'DavidDi Fonzo', 'MohammedRedha', 'MichaelChurchill-Smith']","Secondary central nervous system lymphoma (SCNSL) is a known complication of immunocompromised patients with most cases involving the brain parenchyma. Reports of cauda equina syndrome (CES) caused by SCNSL are exceedingly scarce as involvement of this anatomical region is extremely uncommon.
We report a case of a 46-years-old, African, female patient with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who developed CES in the context of SCNSL. There were no blasts present in the peripheral blood smear. We provide a review of the literature, discussion of the clinical evolution of this patient and the radiological/histopathological findings. The patient ultimately responded well to induction chemotherapy and high dose methotrexate.
This case report demonstrates that CES, while a rare occurrence in this clinical context, should be considered in at-risk patients especially those presenting with abnormal neurological findings. Prompt recognition may prevent permanent neurological injury and obviate the need for more invasive therapeutic interventions.",brain injury

This method is effective for protecting the spinal cord and the brain, heart, and abdominal organs and for avoiding lung damage.
TAAA repair was performed under hypothermia at 20-28 °C in 18 cases (Crawford type I in 0 cases, type II in 5, type III in 3, type IV in 4, and Safi V in 6) between October 2014 and January 2023. Cardiopulmonary bypass was conducted by combined upper and lower body perfusion, with perfusion both via the femoral artery and either transapically or via the descending aorta or the left brachial artery.
The ischemic time for the artery of Adamkiewicz and the main segmental arteries was 40-124 min (75 ± 33 min). No spinal cord ischemic injury or brain or heart complications occurred. One patient with postoperative right renal artery occlusion and one with an infected aneurysm required tracheostomy, but the intubation time for the other 16 was 32 ± 33 h.

Effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy combined with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation on vascular cognitive impairment: a randomised controlled trial protocol.,"['WeiXie', 'XinxinChen', 'XichaoMa', 'SihuiSong', 'HuiMa', 'JiuhongYou', 'ChengHuang']","Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) has an increasing prevalence worldwide, accounting for at least 20%-40% of all diagnoses of dementia. The decline in cognitive function seriously impairs patients' activities of daily living and social participation and reduces their quality of life. However, there is still a lack of advanced, definitive rehabilitation programmes for VCI. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) are recognised treatments for improving cognitive impairment. The former can restore oxygen supply in the brain by increasing oxygen partial pressure in brain tissue, while the latter can enhance neuronal excitability and promote synaptic plasticity. However, no studies have explored the effect of HBO combined with rTMS on VCI.
This study is designed as a single-centre, assessor-blind, randomised controlled clinical trial with four parallel arms. A total of 72 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to the control group, HBOT group, rTMS group and HBOT combined with rTMS group at a ratio of 1:1:1:1. All enrolled participants will receive conventional treatment. The entire intervention period is 4 weeks, with a 3-week follow-up. Outcomes will be measured at baseline (T0), after a 4-week intervention (T1) and after an additional 3-week follow-up period (T2). The primary endpoint is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score.

Sarcopenia is characterised by losses in both muscle mass and strength. Body composition and muscle strength are at least in part genetically determined, consequently polymorphisms in pathways important in muscle biology (e.g., the activin/myostatin signalling pathway) are hypothesised to contribute to the development of sarcopenia.
We compared regional body composition measured by DXA with genotypes for two polymorphisms (rs10783486, minor allele frequency (MAF) = 0.26 and rs2854464, MAF = 0.26) in the activin 1B receptor (ACVR1B) determined by PCR in a cross-sectional analysis of DNA from 110 older individuals with sarcopenia from the LACE trial.
Neither muscle mass nor strength showed any significant associations with either genotype in this cohort. Initial analysis of rs10783486 showed that males with the AA/AG genotype were taller than GG males (174±7cm vs 170±5cm, p = 0.023) and had higher arm fat mass, (median higher by 15%, p = 0.008), and leg fat mass (median higher by 14%, p = 0.042). After correcting for height, arm fat mass remained significantly higher (median higher by 4% padj = 0.024). No associations (adjusted or unadjusted) were seen in females. Similar analysis of the rs2854464 allele showed a similar pattern with the presence of the minor allele (GG/AG) being associated with greater height (GG/AG = 174±7 cm vs AA = 170 ±5cm, p = 0.017) and greater arm fat mass (median higher by 16%, p = 0.023). Again, the difference in arm fat remained after correction for height. No similar associations were seen in females analysed alone.
These data suggest that polymorphic variation in the ACVR1B locus could be associated with body composition in older males. The activin/myostatin pathway might offer a novel potential target to prevent fat accumulation in older individuals.",brain injury
Cerebrovascular Function is Altered in Hemodialysis Patients.,"['Wesley TRicherson', 'Timothy BMeier', 'Alexander DCohen', 'YangWang', 'Max JGoodman', 'Brian DSchmit', 'Dawn FWolfgram']","Hemodialysis (HD) patients have declines in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygenation during HD that may lead to ischemic brain injury. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) may indicate which individuals are more susceptible to intradialytic hypoperfusion and ischemia. We hypothesized that HD patients would have decreased CVR and increased CBF relative to controls and deficits in CVR would be related to brain structural deficits.
We measured cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume from T1 and T2 FLAIR images respectively, CVR from a breath hold BOLD CVR fMRI and arterial transit time (ATT) and CBF from ASL. Cerebrovascular and structural deficits in gray and white matter (GM and WM) were tested by averaging across the tissue and with a pothole analysis. Finally, we correlated cortical thickness and WMH volume with GM and WM cerebrovascular variables to assess the relationship between brain structure and cerebrovascular health.
In ten HD patients, cortical thickness was found to be decreased (p= 0.002), WMH volume increased (p=0.004), and WM CBF increased (p=0.02) relative to ten controls. Pothole analysis indicated a higher number of increased GM and WM CBF voxels (p=0.03, p=0.02) and a higher number of decreased GM and WM CVR voxels (p=0.02, p=0.01).
This pilot study demonstrates that HD patients have decreased CVR and increased CBF relative to controls, along with reduced brain integrity. Further investigation is required to fully understand if these cerebrovascular deficits may lead to structural changes.",brain injury
"Intimate Partner Violence, Mental Health, and Aging-Related Health Among Men and Women Veterans Across the Lifespan.","['Carolyn JGibson', 'AmberBahorik', 'FengXia', 'CarriePeltz', 'KristineYaffe']","A growing body of evidence suggests adverse health outcomes related to intimate partner violence (IPV), including traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, most research in this area has focused on reproductive-aged women.
To examine relationships between IPV (with and without TBI), mental health, and aging-related health outcomes among men and women Veterans across the lifespan.
Cross-sectional analysis of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative data from fiscal years 2000-2019. Descriptive statistics and chi-square analyses were used to compare key comorbidities in matched samples of Veterans with and without IPV (gender-stratified and matched 1:3 based on demographics and index date). Comparisons between those with IPV and TBI relative to IPV alone were also examined.
Veterans aged 18 + with and without documented IPV in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic health records (n = 4108 men, 2824 women).
ICD codes were used to identify IPV, TBI, and aging-related medical (sleep disorder, hypertension, diabetes, dementia) and common psychiatric (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorder, and substance use disorder) diagnoses.
Demographic characteristics were reflective of VA-enrolled Veterans (men: mean age 66, SD 16; 72% non-Hispanic White; women: mean age 47, SD 13; 64% non-Hispanic White). Relative to Veterans without IPV, both men and women with IPV had higher rates of all examined medical (e.g., sleep disorders, men: 33% vs. 52%; women: 45% vs. 63%) and psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., depression, men 32% vs. 74%; women 59% vs. 91%; all ps < .001), with evidence of an additive effect of TBI on some psychiatric outcomes.
IPV is broadly associated with aging-related and mental health, and TBI is a common correlate that may further contribute to psychiatric outcomes. Findings highlight the importance of trauma-informed care and recognizing the potential role of these exposures on men and women Veterans' health across the lifespan.",brain injury

The current study investigated the time to asymptomatic and RTP across a broad range of male and female collegiate sports and sought to group sports by recovery intervals. Data from the Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium included 1049 collegiate athletes who sustained a SRC while participating in game or practice/training of their primary sport. Injury setting and subsequent clinical presentation data were obtained. Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazard model estimated the median recovery times for each sport. Optimal univariate K-means clustering grouped sports into recovery categories. Across all sports, median time to asymptomatic following SRC ranged from 5.9 (female basketball) to 8.6 days (male wrestling). Median RTP protocol duration ranged from 4.9 days (female volleyball) to 6.3 days (male wrestling). Median total RTP days ranged from 11.2 days (female lacrosse) to 16.9 days (male wrestling). Sport clusters based on recovery differences in time to asymptomatic (3) and RTP protocol duration (2) were identified. The findings from this study of a large sample of more than 1000 NCAA collegiate athletes with SRC show there exists ranges in recovery trajectories. Clinicians can thus manage athletes with similar guidelines, with individualized treatment and recovery plans.",brain injury
The Utility of Methylphenidate for Fatigue in Long-Term Neurological Conditions: A Meta-analytical Review.,"['Alexander JamesHagan', 'RamKumar']","Fatigue is a chronic and debilitating symptom of many long-term neurological conditions (LTNCs). Although methylphenidate provides some promise in alleviating fatigue in other clinical groups, little work has explored its potential utility within LTNCs. The current systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the utility of methylphenidate for symptoms of fatigue in LTNCs.
Five databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) were searched for relevant articles from their inception to February 2022. A purpose-developed evaluation tool was used to assess each study's research quality (QuEST:F).
Of the 1698 articles identified, 11 articles were included within this review (n = 370). Meta-analytical findings reported an overall significant benefit of methylphenidate for symptoms of fatigue across a mixed neurological sample ( g = -0.44; 95% confidence interval, -0.77 to -0.11). Subgroup analyses identified a significantly greater benefit ( P < 0.001) of methylphenidate for fatigue in LTNCs with static pathogenic trajectories (eg, traumatic brain injury) (number needed to treat = 2.5) compared with progressive conditions (eg, multiple sclerosis) (number needed to treat = 40.2).
Methylphenidate may pose an effective intervention for the treatment of fatigue in a number of LTNCs. Nonetheless, given the quality of the current evidence base, there exists a clear need for further robust assessment of the utility of methylphenidate-with a focus on subgroup-specific variability.",brain injury
Consciousness Recovery in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review Comparing Modafinil and Amantadine.,"['AliSeifi', 'SinaHassannezhad', 'RezaMosaddeghi-Heris', 'ArashHaji Kamanaj Olia', 'AliAdib', 'ShaheryarHafeez', 'ColleenBarthol']","Acute traumatic brain injury is one of the most common causes of death and disability. Reduction in the level of consciousness is a significant complication that can impact morbidity. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is the most widely used method of assessing the level of consciousness. Neurostimulants such as amantadine and modafinil are common pharmacologic agents that increase GCS in patients with brain trauma. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of these 2 drugs.
This systematic review obtained articles from Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and MEDLINE databases. Extensive searches were conducted separately by 4 individuals in 3 stages. Ultimately, 16 clinical trials, cohort studies, case reports, and case series articles were obtained after reading the title, abstract, and full text and considering the exclusion criteria. The data of the final article were entered into the analysis table. This study was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42022334409) and conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
Amantadine seems to be associated with a higher overall response rate. In contrast, modafinil is associated with the most remarkable change in GCS score during treatment. However, the number of clinical trials with high quality and sample size has not been satisfactory to compare the effectiveness of these 2 drugs and their potential side effects.
The authors recommend additional double-blind clinical trials are needed to be conducted with a larger sample size, comparing amantadine with modafinil to delineate the efficacy and adverse effects, both short and long term.",brain injury
Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Reduces LPS-Induced Inflammatory Response Via ATF3 Transcription Factor and Stimulates Src/Syk Signaling-Dependent Phagocytosis in Microglia.,"['KatarzynaWieczorek-Szukala', 'MonikaMarkiewicz', 'AnnaWalczewska', 'EmiliaZgorzynska']","Microglial cells play a crucial role in the development of neuroinflammation in response to harmful stimuli, such as infection, ischemia or injury. Their chronic activation, however, is associated with a progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, looking for potential factors limiting microglial activation, the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the inflammatory response and TREM2-dependent phagocytic activity in microglia was investigated.
In LPS-induced primary microglia preincubated with DHA, or without preincubation the expression of ATF3 and TREM2 genes and TREM2, Syk, Akt proteins were determined by RT-PCR and WB, respectively. Cell viability was assayed by MTT and cytokine and chemokine expression was determined by the Proteome Profiler assay. Moreover, the phagocytic activity of microglia was assayed using immunofluorescence.
We found that DHA significantly increased the expression of ATF3 , and decreased the levels of CINC-1, CINC-2αβ, CINC-3 chemokines, IL-1α and IL-1β cytokines, and ICAM-1 adhesion protein. Additionally, preincubation of microglia with DHA resulted in increased Src/Syk kinases activation associated with increased phagocytic microglia activity.
These findings indicate that DHA efficiently inhibits ATF3-dependent release of proinflammatory mediators and enhances phagocytic activity of microglia. The study provides a new mechanism of DHA action in reactive microglia, which may help limit neuronal damage caused by the pro-inflammatory milieu in the brain.",brain injury
Protective effects of Hinokitiol on neuronal ferroptosis by activating the KEAP1/NRF-2/HO-1 pathway in traumatic brain injury.,"['HongxingTang', 'KejunHe', 'KunZhao', 'ChenZheng', 'WeichiWu', 'WeilinJin', 'LixuanYang', 'BaoshuXie']","Hinokitiol (β-thujaplicin, HIK) is a natural monoterpene small molecule compound showing various biological effects including antibacterial, anti- inflammatory and anti-tumor. Ferroptosis, a new form of iron-dependent cell death, has been demonstrated as one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the effect of hinokitiol on neuronal ferroptosis after traumatic brain injury has not been reported. Here, we show that hinokitiol alleviated excessive glutamate-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, and Fe2+ accumulation in HT-22. Moreover, hinokitiol upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, promoted nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) nuclear translocation, and inhibited the activation of microglia and astrocyte after TBI. Furthermore, hinokitiol remarkably reduced brain tissue lesions, mitigated neuron loss, iron deposition and attenuated neurologic impairment in the CCI-constructed TBI model in vivo. These results suggest that hinokitiol has neuroprotective effects on rescuing cells from TBI-induced neuronal ferroptosis. In summary, we reveal a novel role of hinokitiol in TBI, which has neuroprotective effects on rescuing cells from TBI-induced neuronal ferroptosis. Moreover, hinokitiol through activating the Nrf2/Keap1/HO-1 signaling pathway significantly reduces the neuronal damage, suggesting that it is a potential therapeutic candidate for TBI.",brain injury
Capillary regression leads to sustained local hypoperfusion by inducing vasoconstriction in upstream transitional vessels.,"['Stephanie KBonney', 'Cara DNielson', 'Maria JSosa', 'Andy YShih']","In the brain, a microvascular sensory web coordinates oxygen delivery to regions with neuronal activity. This involves a dense network of capillaries that send conductive signals upstream to feeding arterioles to promote vasodilation and blood flow.

Deterioration of capillary networks is a hallmark of many neurological disorders and how this web is engaged during vascular damage remains unknown. We performed 
Deterioration of the capillary network is a hallmark of many neurological diseases and can exacerbate neuronal dysfunction and degeneration due to poor blood perfusion. Here we show that focal capillary injuries can induce vessel regression and elicit sustained vasoconstriction in upstream transitional vessels that branch from cortical penetrating arterioles. This reduces blood flow to broader, uninjured regions of the same microvascular network. These findings suggest that widespread and cumulative damage to brain capillaries in neurological disease may broadly affect blood supply and contribute to disease through their remote actions.",brain injury

CST damage was indexed with weighted CST lesion load (CST-LL). Mixed effects beta-regression models were fit to test the impact of CST-LL, WMH volume, and their interaction on motor impairment. WMH volume related to motor impairment above and beyond CST-LL (β = 0.178, p = 0.022). We tested if relationships varied by WMH severity (mild vs. moderate-severe). In individuals with mild WMHs, motor impairment related to CST-LL (β = 0.888, p < 0.001) with a CST-LL x WMH interaction (β = -0.211, 0.026). In individuals with moderate-severe WMHs, motor impairment related to WMH volume (β = 0.299, p = 0.044), but did not significantly relate to CST-LL or a CST-LL x WMH interaction. WMH-related damage may be under-recognised in stroke research as a factor contributing to variability in motor outcomes.

Neutrophilia with damage to the blood-brain barrier and neurovascular unit following acute lung injury.,"['HermanLi', 'LinhLe', 'MariahMarrero', 'JenniferDavid-Bercholz', 'Ana ICaceres', 'ClaireLim', 'WesleyChiang', 'Ania KMajewska', 'NiccolòTerrando', 'Harris AGelbard']","Links between acute lung injury (ALI), infectious disease, and neurological outcomes have been frequently discussed over the past few years, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, much of the cross-communication between organs, particularly the lung and the brain, has been understudied. Here, we have focused on the role of neutrophils in driving changes to the brain endothelium with ensuing microglial activation and neuronal loss in a model of ALI.
We have applied a three-dose paradigm of 10μg/40μl intranasal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce neutrophilia accompanied by proteinaceous exudate in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in adult C57BL/6 mice. Brain endothelial markers, microglial activation, and neuronal cytoarchitecture were evaluated 24hr after the last intranasal dose of LPS or saline. C57BL/6-
Three doses of intranasal LPS induced robust neutrophilia accompanied by proteinaceous exudate in BALF. ALI triggered central nervous system pathology as highlighted by robust activation of the cerebrovascular endothelium (VCAM1, CD31), accumulation of plasma protein (fibrinogen), microglial activation (IBA1, CD68), and decreased expression of proteins associated with postsynaptic terminals (PSD-95) in the hippocampal stratum lacunosum moleculare, a relay station between the entorhinal cortex and CA1 of the hippocampus. 2-photon imaging of Catchup mice revealed neutrophil homing to the cerebral endothelium in the blood-brain barrier and neutrophil extravasation from cerebral vasculature 24hr after the last intranasal treatment.
Overall, these data demonstrate ensuing brain pathology resulting from ALI, highlighting a key role for neutrophils in driving brain endothelial changes and subsequent neuroinflammation. This paradigm may have a considerable translational impact on understanding how infectious disease with ALI can lead to neurodegeneration, particularly in the elderly.",brain injury
Functional neuroimaging related to lower urinary tract sensations: Future directions for study designs and selection of patient groups: ICI-RS 2023.,"['Mathijs Mde Rijk', 'Marcus JDrake', 'Alexandervon Gontard', 'EskinderSolomon', 'RogerDmochowski', 'BrigitteSchurch', 'Gommert Avan Koeveringe']","Neuroimaging studies have advanced our understanding of the intricate central nervous system control network governing lower urinary tract (LUT) function, shedding light on mechanisms for urine storage and voiding. However, a lack of consensus in methodological approaches hinders the comparability of results among research groups and limits the translation of this knowledge to clinical applications, emphasizing the need for standardized methodologies and clinical utilization guidelines.
This paper reports the discussions of a workshop at the 2023 meeting of the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society, which reviewed uncertainties and research priorities to progress the field of neuroimaging in LUT control and dysfunction.
Neuroimaging holds great potential for improving our understanding of LUT control and pathophysiological conditions. To date, functional neuroimaging techniques have not yet achieved sufficient strength to make a direct clinical impact. Potential approaches that can improve the clinical utilization of neuroimaging were discussed and research questions proposed.
Neuroimaging offers a valuable tool for investigating LUT control, but it's essential to acknowledge the potential for oversimplification when interpreting brain activity due to the complex neural processing and filtering of sensory information. Moreover, technical limitations pose challenges in assessing key brain stem and spinal cord centers, particularly in cases of neurological dysfunction, highlighting the need for more reliable imaging of these centers to advance our understanding of LUT function and dysfunction.",brain injury
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy induce tension pneumocephalus in a patient with ventriculoperitoneal shunt: A case report and literature review.,"['Tan-SiChu', 'Tan-HuyChu', 'Tri-DungHuynh', 'Hoang-VuMai', 'Van-DinhPhan', 'Bao-NgocDang', 'Quoc-DatTran', 'Xuan-SangLe']","We report on a 45-year-old woman who has a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS), experienced drowsy mental status, with hypesthesia and hemiplegia on the left side. Ten days ago she underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Computed tomography revealed tension pneumocephalus, with severe compression on the right side of the brain.
She underwent 2 surgeries, the first surgery was to place a subdural drainage catheter, however, the pneumocephalus relapsed after withdrawing the catheter, and the later surgery was to replace the new VPS.
After replacing the VPS, the patient recovers completely after 10 weeks of follow-up.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of LC-induced tension pneumocephalus in a patient with VPS. The purpose of this study is to share our experience, with the hypothesized mechanism being the retrograde air through the VPS valve because of high abdominal pressurization. We recommend noting the existence of the VPS when the LC or any abdominal laparoscopy is performed. The VPS should be clamped during any laparoscopic procedure until complete depressurization. Furthermore, all patients with VPS who have neurological deterioration after abdominal laparoscopy should be treated as having the diagnosis of a tension pneumocephalus. These patients need emergency surgery to replace VPS and set the valve for high-pressure, which can result in a quick and complete recovery.",brain injury
Fgf2 and Ptpn11 play a role in cerebral injury caused by sevoflurane anesthesia.,"['LinZhang', 'LingyanXu']","Sevoflurane is a new inhaled anesthetic, which has better physical properties than the existing inhalational anesthetics, rapid induction, less tissue uptake, and faster recovery. Sevoflurane can directly dilators cerebral blood vessels and increase cerebral blood flow, but it also reduces cerebral oxygen metabolism rate, thereby reducing cerebral blood flow. However, the role of Fgf2 and Ptpn11 in cerebral injury caused by sevoflurane anesthesia remains unclear. The sevoflurane anesthesia brain tissue datasets GSE139220 and GSE141242 were downloaded from gene expression omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed. Construction and analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) Network. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG), comparative toxicogenomics database (CTD) were performed. A heat map of gene expression was drawn. TargetScan was used to screen miRNAs regulating DEGs. 500 DEGs were identified. According to GO, in Biological Process analysis, they were mainly enriched in response to hypoxia, blood vessel development, inner ear development, neural tube closure, and aging. In Cellular Component (CC), they were mainly enriched in plasma membrane, integral component of membrane, and basal lamina. In Molecular Function (MF), they were mainly associated with protein binding, Wnt-activated receptor activity, and organic anion transmembrane transporter activity. In the KEGG analysis, they were mainly enriched in proteoglycans in cancer, pathways in cancer, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, basal cell carcinoma, thyroid hormone signaling pathway. In the Metascape enrichment analysis, the GO enrichment items revealed upregulated regulation of vascular endothelial cell proliferation, platelet-derived growth factor receptor signaling pathway, inner ear development, and response to hypoxia. A total of 20 modules were generated. Gene Expression Heatmap showed that the core genes (Fgf2, Pdgfra, Ptpn11, Slc2a1) were highly expressed in sevoflurane anesthesia brain tissue samples. CTD Analysis showed that the 4 core genes (Fgf2, Pdgfra, Ptpn11, Slc2a1) were associated with neurodegenerative diseases, brain injuries, memory disorders, cognitive disorders, neurotoxicity, drug-induced abnormalities, neurological disorders, developmental disorders, and intellectual disabilities. Fgf2 and Ptpn11 are highly expressed in brain tissue after sevoflurane anesthesia, higher the expression level of Fgf2 and Ptpn11, worse the prognosis.",brain injury
"Diet's Impact on Post-Traumatic Brain Injury Depression: Exploring Neurodegeneration, Chronic Blood-Brain Barrier Destruction, and Glutamate Neurotoxicity Mechanisms.","['MatthewBoyko', 'Benjamin FGruenbaum', 'AnnaOleshko', 'IgorMerzlikin', 'AlexanderZlotnik']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a profound impact on cognitive and mental functioning, leading to lifelong impairment and significantly diminishing the quality of life for affected individuals. A healthy blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in guarding the brain against elevated levels of blood glutamate, making its permeability a vital aspect of glutamate regulation within the brain. Studies have shown the efficacy of reducing excess glutamate in the brain as a treatment for post-TBI depression, anxiety, and aggression. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the involvement of dietary glutamate in the development of depression after TBI. We performed a literature search to examine the effects of diets abundant in glutamate, which are common in Asian populations, when compared to diets low in glutamate, which are prevalent in Europe and America. We specifically explored these effects in the context of chronic BBB damage after TBI, which may initiate neurodegeneration and subsequently have an impact on depression through the mechanism of chronic glutamate neurotoxicity. A glutamate-rich diet leads to increased blood glutamate levels when contrasted with a glutamate-poor diet. Within the context of chronic BBB disruption, elevated blood glutamate levels translate to heightened brain glutamate concentrations, thereby intensifying neurodegeneration due to glutamate neurotoxicity.",brain injury

Seven days after brain injury, a reduction in NO content of 84% in injured brain regions and 66% in intact brain regions was found. The difference in NO production in injured and uninjured brain regions persisted 7 days after injury. The copper content in the brain remained unchanged one week after modeling of brain and spinal cord injury.

Glaucoma as a Tauopathy-Is It the Missing Piece in the Glaucoma Puzzle?,"['Maria LauraPassaro', 'FrancescoMatarazzo', 'GianmarcoAbbadessa', 'AntonioPezone', 'AntonioPorcellini', 'FaustoTranfa', 'MicheleRinaldi', 'CiroCostagliola']","Glaucoma is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder affecting the visual system which can result in vision loss and blindness. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying glaucomatous optic neuropathy are ultimately enigmatic, prompting ongoing investigations into its potential shared pathogenesis with other neurodegenerative neurological disorders. Tauopathies represent a subclass of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the abnormal deposition of tau protein within the brain and consequent microtubule destabilization. The extended spectrum of tauopathies includes conditions such as frontotemporal dementias, progressive supranuclear palsy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease. Notably, recent decades have witnessed emerging documentation of tau inclusion among glaucoma patients, providing substantiation that this ocular disease may similarly manifest features of tauopathies. These studies found that: (i) aggregated tau inclusions are present in the somatodendritic compartment of RGCs in glaucoma patients; (ii) the etiology of the disease may affect tau splicing, phosphorylation, oligomerization, and subcellular localization; and (iii) short interfering RNA against tau, administered intraocularly, significantly decreased retinal tau accumulation and enhanced RGC somas and axon survival, demonstrating a crucial role for tau modifications in ocular hypertension-induced neuronal injury. Here, we examine the most recent evidence surrounding the interplay between tau protein dysregulation and glaucomatous neurodegeneration. We explore the novel perspective of glaucoma as a tau-associated disorder and open avenues for cross-disciplinary collaboration and new treatment strategies.",brain injury
Sex Differences in Outcome of Trauma Patients Presented with Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: A Multicenter Cohort Study.,"['EliseBeijer', 'Stefan Fvan Wonderen', 'Wietse PZuidema', 'Marieke CVisser', 'Michael J REdwards', 'Michael H JVerhofstad', 'Tjarda NTromp', 'Charissa Evan den Brom', 'Esther M Mvan Lieshout', 'Frank WBloemers', 'Leo M GGeeraedts']","The objective of this study was to determine whether there is an association between sex and outcome in trauma patients presented with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). A retrospective multicenter study was performed in trauma patients aged ≥ 16 years who presented with severe TBI (Head Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) ≥ 4) over a 4-year-period. Subgroup analyses were performed for ages 16-44 and ≥45 years. Also, patients with isolated severe TBI (other AIS ≤ 2) were assessed, likewise, with subgroup analysis for age. Sex differences in mortality, Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS), ICU admission/length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and mechanical ventilation (MV) were examined. A total of 1566 severe TBI patients were included (831 patients with isolated TBI). Crude analysis shows an association between female sex and lower ICU admission rates, shorter ICU/hospital LOS, and less frequent and shorter MV in severe TBI patients ≥ 45 years. After adjusting, female sex appears to be associated with shorter ICU/hospital LOS. Sex differences in mortality and GOS were not found. In conclusion, this study found sex differences in patient outcomes following severe TBI, potentially favoring (older) females, which appear to indicate shorter ICU/hospital LOS (adjusted analysis). Large prospective studies are warranted to help unravel sex differences in outcomes after severe TBI.",brain injury
Histological Assessment of the Bile Duct before Liver Transplantation: Does the Bile Duct Injury Score Predict Biliary Strictures?,"['MarkLy', 'Ngee-SoonLau', 'CatrionaMcKenzie', 'James GKench', 'DorukSeyfi', 'AvikMajumdar', 'KenLiu', 'GeoffreyMcCaughan', 'MichaelCrawford', 'CarloPulitano']","Histological injury to the biliary tree during organ preservation leads to biliary strictures after liver transplantation. The Bile Duct Injury (BDI) score was developed to assess histological injury and identify the grafts most likely to develop biliary strictures. The BDI score evaluates the bile duct mural stroma, peribiliary vascular plexus (PVP) and deep peribiliary glands (DPGs), which were correlated with post-transplant biliary strictures. However, the BDI score has not been externally validated. The aim of this study was to verify whether the BDI score could predict biliary strictures at our transplant centre.
Brain-dead donor liver grafts transplanted at a single institution from March 2015 to June 2016 were included in this analysis. Bile duct biopsies were collected immediately before transplantation and assessed for bile duct injury by two blinded pathologists. The primary outcome was the development of clinically significant biliary strictures within 24 months post-transplant.
Fifty-seven grafts were included in the study which included 16 biliary strictures (28%). Using the BDI score, mural stromal, PVP and DPG injury did not correlate with biliary strictures including Non-Anastomotic Strictures. Severe inflammation (>50 leucocytes per HPF) was the only histological feature inversely correlated with the primary outcome (absent in the biliary stricture group vs. 41% in the no-stricture group, 
The current study highlights limitations of the histological assessment of bile duct injury. Although all grafts had bile duct injury, only inflammation was associated with biliary strictures. The BDI score was unable to predict post-transplant biliary strictures in our patient population.",brain injury
Evolving Clinical-Translational Investigations of Cerebroprotection in Ischemic Stroke.,"['YinghuiLi', 'Laurel ESchappell', 'ClairePolizu', 'JamesDiPersio', 'Stella ETsirka', 'Marc WHalterman', 'Neil ANadkarni']","Ischemic stroke is a highly morbid disease, with over 50% of large vessel stroke (middle cerebral artery or internal carotid artery terminus occlusion) patients suffering disability despite maximal acute reperfusion therapy with thrombolysis and thrombectomy. The discovery of the ischemic penumbra in the 1980s laid the foundation for a salvageable territory in ischemic stroke. Since then, the concept of neuroprotection has been a focus of post-stroke care to (1) minimize the conversion from penumbra to core irreversible infarct, (2) limit secondary damage from ischemia-reperfusion injury, inflammation, and excitotoxicity and (3) to encourage tissue repair. However, despite multiple studies, the preclinical-clinical research enterprise has not yet created an agent that mitigates post-stroke outcomes beyond thrombolysis and mechanical clot retrieval. These translational gaps have not deterred the scientific community as agents are under continuous investigation. The NIH has recently promoted the concept of cerebroprotection to consider the whole brain post-stroke rather than just the neurons. This review will briefly outline the translational science of past, current, and emerging breakthroughs in cerebroprotection and use of these foundational ideas to develop a novel paradigm for optimizing stroke outcomes.",brain injury

Maximizing the Clinical Value of Blood-Based Biomarkers for Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"['Steven HRauchman', 'AaronPinkhasov', 'ShellyGulkarov', 'Dimitris GPlacantonakis', 'JoshuaDe Leon', 'Allison BReiss']","Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and concussion can have serious consequences that develop over time with unpredictable levels of recovery. Millions of concussions occur yearly, and a substantial number result in lingering symptoms, loss of productivity, and lower quality of life. The diagnosis may not be made for multiple reasons, including due to patient hesitancy to undergo neuroimaging and inability of imaging to detect minimal damage. Biomarkers could fill this gap, but the time needed to send blood to a laboratory for analysis made this impractical until point-of-care measurement became available. A handheld blood test is now on the market for diagnosis of concussion based on the specific blood biomarkers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and ubiquitin carboxyl terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1). This paper discusses rapid blood biomarker assessment for mild TBI and its implications in improving prediction of TBI course, avoiding repeated head trauma, and its potential role in assessing new therapeutic options. Although we focus on the Abbott i-STAT TBI plasma test because it is the first to be FDA-cleared, our discussion applies to any comparable test systems that may become available in the future.

FunctionaL Assessment Scale of Hemianopia (FLASH): A New Multidisciplinary Tool to Assess Hemianopia in Patients with Severe Acquired Brain Injury.,"['SusannaLucatello', 'SaraDe Angelis', 'ConcettaDi Lorenzo', 'MarcoIosa', 'LuisaMagnotti', 'MartaDi Paolo', 'MariaDe Luca', 'Maria GabriellaBuzzi', 'MarcoTramontano']","Severe acquired brain injury (sABI) encompasses a range of neurological impairments. Visual dysfunction, particularly homonymous visual field defects (HVFDs) and homonymous hemianopia (HH), commonly afflicts sABI survivors, affecting their cognitive and motor rehabilitation. This study presents the FunctionaL Assessment Scale of Hemianopia (FLASH), developed to analyze the most common postural behaviors exhibited by sABI patients with hemianopia during activities of daily living. A comparison to traditional static automated perimetry for diagnosing visual field deficits (VFDs) to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the FLASH was used. Additionally, this study also aimed to assess its reliability.
Fifty-six patients (25 F, 31 M, mean age 60.59 ± 14.53) with strokes in the sub-acute phase (<6 months from the onset) were assessed with both FLASH and a Humphrey Field Analyzer.
After removing two items found to be less reliable than others, FLASH showed high sensitivity (81%) and specificity (77%) when compared to static automated perimetry. Inter-rater reliability was also high, with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.954, as well as the internal consistency computed by Cronbach's alpha, equal to 0.874.
FLASH could offer a valuable and cost-effective screening tool for VFD in sABI patients during neurorehabilitation, with potential implications for healthcare cost reduction.",brain injury
Supporting the Frontlines: A Scoping Review Addressing the Health Challenges of Military Personnel and Veterans.,"['AbdullahAlruwaili', 'AmirKhorram-Manesh', 'AmilaRatnayake', 'YohanRobinson', 'KrzysztofGoniewicz']","(1) Background: Military personnel and veterans meet unique health challenges that stem from the complex interplay of their service experiences, the nature of warfare, and their interactions with both military and civilian healthcare systems. This study aims to examine the myriad of injuries and medical conditions specific to this population, encompassing physical and psychological traumas. (2) Methods: A scoping review (systematic search and non-systematic review) was performed to evaluate the current landscape of military healthcare. (3) Results: A significant change in the injury profile over time is identified, linked to shifts in combat strategies and the integration of advanced technologies in warfare. Environmental exposures to diverse chemical or natural agents further complicate the health of service members. Additionally, the stressors they face, ranging from routine stress to traumatic experiences, lead to various mental health challenges. A major concern is the gap in healthcare accessibility and quality, worsened by challenges in the civilian healthcare system's capacity to address these unique needs and the military healthcare system's limitations.

The miR-210 Primed Endothelial Progenitor Cell Exosomes Alleviate Acute Ischemic Brain Injury.,"['JinjuWang', 'ShuzhenChen', 'HarshalSawant', 'YanfangChen', 'JiBihl']","Stem cell-released exosomes (EXs) have shown beneficial effects on regenerative diseases. Our previous study has revealed that EXs of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC-EXs) can elicit favorable effects on endothelial function. EXs may vary greatly in size, composition, and cargo uptake rate depending on the origins and stimulus; notably, EXs are promising vehicles for delivering microRNAs (miRs). Since miR-210 is known to protect cerebral endothelial cell mitochondria by reducing oxidative stress, here we study the effects of miR-210-loaded EPC-EXs (miR210-EPC-EXs) on ischemic brain damage in acute ischemic stroke (IS).
The miR210-EPC-EXs were generated from EPCs transfected with miR-210 mimic. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) surgery was performed to induce acute IS in C57BL/6 mice. EPC-EXs or miR210-EPC-EXs were administrated via tail vein injection 2 hrs after IS. To explore the potential mechanisms, inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)/PI3 kinase (PI3K) or tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB)/PI3k pathways were used. The brain tissue was collected after treatments for infarct size, cell apoptosis, oxidative stress, and protein expression (VEGFR2, TrkB) analyses on day two. The neurological deficit score (NDS) was evaluated before collecting the samples.
1) As compared to EPC-EXs, miR210-EPC-EXs profoundly reduced the infarct volume and improved the NDS on day two post-IS. 2) Fewer apoptosis cells were detected in the peri-infarct brain of mice treated with miR210-EPC-EXs than in EPC-EXs-treated mice. Meanwhile, the oxidative stress was profoundly reduced by miR210-EPC-EXs. 3) The ratios of p-PI3k/PI3k, p- VEGFR2/VEGFR2, and p-TrkB/TrkB in the ipsilateral brain were raised by miR210-EPC-EXs treatment. These effects could be significantly blocked or partially inhibited by PI3k, VEGFR2, or TrkB pathway inhibitors.
These findings suggest that miR210-EPC-EXs protect the brain from acute ischemia- induced cell apoptosis and oxidative stress partially through the VEGFR2/PI3k and TrkB/PI3k signal pathways.",brain injury
Experience of early-life pain in premature infants is associated with atypical cerebellar development and later neurodevelopmental deficits.,"['Kevin MCook', 'JosepheenDe Asis-Cruz', 'Jung-HoonKim', 'Sudeepta KBasu', 'NickieAndescavage', 'JonathanMurnick', 'EmmaSpoehr', 'MelissaLiggett', 'Adré Jdu Plessis', 'CatherineLimperopoulos']","Infants born very and extremely premature (V/EPT) are at a significantly elevated risk for neurodevelopmental disorders and delays even in the absence of structural brain injuries. These risks may be due to earlier-than-typical exposure to the extrauterine environment, and its bright lights, loud noises, and exposures to painful procedures. Given the relative underdeveloped pain modulatory responses in these infants, frequent pain exposures may confer risk for later deficits.
Resting-state fMRI scans were collected at term equivalent age from 148 (45% male) infants born V/EPT and 99 infants (56% male) born at term age. Functional connectivity analyses were performed between functional regions correlating connectivity to the number of painful skin break procedures in the NICU, including heel lances, venipunctures, and IV placements. Subsequently, preterm infants returned at 18 months, for neurodevelopmental follow-up and completed assessments for autism risk and general neurodevelopment.
We observed that V/EPT infants exhibit pronounced hyperconnectivity within the cerebellum and between the cerebellum and both limbic and paralimbic regions correlating with the number of skin break procedures. Moreover, skin breaks were strongly associated with autism risk, motor, and language scores at 18 months. Subsample analyses revealed that the same cerebellar connections strongly correlating with breaks at term age were associated with language dysfunction at 18 months.
These results have significant implications for the clinical care of preterm infants undergoing painful exposures during routine NICU care, which typically occurs without anesthesia. Repeated pain exposures appear to have an increasingly detrimental effect on brain development during a critical period, and effects continue to be seen even 18 months later.",brain injury
Hippocampal Microglia Activation Induced by Acute Pancreatic Injury in Rats.,"['TamiresCabral-França', 'Fernanda FerreiraCruz', 'Paulo CesarSilva', 'Vera Lucia NunesPannain', 'ArleteFernandes', 'José Marcus RasoEulálio', 'Maurício MagalhãesPaiva', 'HugoMacedo-Ramos', 'Jose Eduardo FerreiraManso', 'WagnerBaetas-da-Cruz']","Acute pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreatic glandular parenchyma that causes injury with or without the destruction of pancreatic acini. Clinical and experimental evidence suggest that certain systemic proinflammatory mediators may be responsible for initiating the fundamental mechanisms involved in microglial reactivity. Here, we investigated the possible repercussions of acute pancreatitis (AP) on the production of inflammatory mediators in the brain parenchyma focusing on microglial activation in the hippocampus.
The acute pancreatic injury in rats was induced by a pancreas ligation surgical procedure (PLSP) on the splenic lobe, which corresponds to approximately 10% of total mass of the pancreas. Blood samples were collected via intracardiac puncture for the measurement of serum amylase. After euthanasia, frozen or paraffin-embedded brains and pancreas were analyzed using qRT-PCR or immunohistochemistry, respectively.
Immunohistochemistry assays showed a large number of Iba1 and PU.1-positive cells in the CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG) regions of the hippocampus of the PLSP group. TNF-α mRNA expression was significantly higher in the brain from PLSP group. NLRP3 inflammasome expression was found to be significantly increased in the pancreas and brain of rats of the PLSP group. High levels of BNDF mRNA were found in the rat brain of PLSP group. In contrast, NGF mRNA levels were significantly higher in the control group versus PLSP group.
Our findings suggest that AP has the potential to induce morphological changes in microglia consistent with an activated phenotype.",brain injury
Brain age predicted using graph convolutional neural network explains neurodevelopmental trajectory in preterm neonates.,"['MengtingLiu', 'MinhuaLu', 'Sharon YKim', 'Hyun JuLee', 'Ben ADuffy', 'ShiyuYuan', 'YaqiongChai', 'James HCole', 'XiaotongWu', 'Arthur WToga', 'NedaJahanshad', 'DawnGano', 'Anthony JamesBarkovich', 'DuanXu', 'HosungKim']","Dramatic brain morphological changes occur throughout the third trimester of gestation. In this study, we investigated whether the predicted brain age (PBA) derived from graph convolutional network (GCN) that accounts for cortical morphometrics in third trimester is associated with postnatal abnormalities and neurodevelopmental outcome.
In total, 577 T1 MRI scans of preterm neonates from two different datasets were analyzed; the NEOCIVET pipeline generated cortical surfaces and morphological features, which were then fed to the GCN to predict brain age. The brain age index (BAI; PBA minus chronological age) was used to determine the relationships among preterm birth (i.e., birthweight and birth age), perinatal brain injuries, postnatal events/clinical conditions, BAI at postnatal scan, and neurodevelopmental scores at 30 months.
Brain morphology and GCN-based age prediction of preterm neonates without brain lesions (mean absolute error [MAE]: 0.96 weeks) outperformed conventional machine learning methods using no topological information. Structural equation models (SEM) showed that BAI mediated the influence of preterm birth and postnatal clinical factors, but not perinatal brain injuries, on neurodevelopmental outcome at 30 months of age.
Brain morphology may be clinically meaningful in measuring brain age, as it relates to postnatal factors, and predicting neurodevelopmental outcome.
Understanding the neurodevelopmental trajectory of preterm neonates through the prediction of brain age using a graph convolutional neural network may allow for earlier detection of potential developmental abnormalities and improved interventions, consequently enhancing the prognosis and quality of life in this vulnerable population.
•Brain age in preterm neonates predicted using a graph convolutional network with brain morphological changes mediates the pre-scan risk factors and post-scan neurodevelopmental outcomes. •Predicted brain age oriented from conventional deep learning approaches, which indicates the neurodevelopmental status in neonates, shows a lack of sensitivity to perinatal risk factors and predicting neurodevelopmental outcomes. •The new brain age index based on brain morphology and graph convolutional network enhances the accuracy and clinical interpretation of predicted brain age for neonates.",brain injury

Proteomic discovery of prognostic protein biomarkers for persisting problems after mild traumatic brain injury.,"['Min-YongLee', 'MinsooSon', 'Hyun HaengLee', 'Min-GuKang', 'Seo JungYun', 'Han GilSeo', 'YoungsooKim', 'Byung-MoOh']","Some individuals with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as concussion, have neuropsychiatric and physical problems that last longer than a few months. Symptoms following mTBI are not only impacted by the kind and severity of the injury but also by the post-injury experience and the individual's responses to it, making the persistence of mTBI particularly difficult to predict. We aimed to identify prognostic blood-based protein biomarkers predicting 6-month outcomes, in light of the clinical course after the injury, in a longitudinal mTBI cohort (N = 42). Among 420 target proteins quantified by multiple-reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry assays of blood samples, 31, 43, and 15 proteins were significantly associated with the poor recovery of neuropsychological symptoms at < 72 h, 1 week, and 1 month after the injury, respectively. Sequential associations among clinical assessments (depressive symptoms and cognitive function) affecting the 6-month outcomes were evaluated. Then, candidate biomarker proteins indirectly affecting the outcome via neuropsychological symptoms were identified. Using the identified proteins, prognostic models that can predict the 6-month outcome of mTBI were developed. These protein biomarkers established in the context of the clinical course of mTBI may have potential for clinical application.",brain injury
Indoxyl sulfate induces apoptotic cell death by inhibiting glycolysis in human astrocytes.,"['Seung-HyunJeong', 'SamelPark', 'Jae-SungChoi', 'Nam-JunCho', 'Jong-SeokMoon', 'Hyo-WookGil']","Neurologic complications, such as cognitive and emotional dysfunction, have frequently been observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Previous research shows that uremic toxins play a role in the pathogenesis of CKD-associated cognitive impairment. Since astrocytes contribute to the protection and survival of neurons, astrocyte function and brain metabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. Indoxyl sulfate (IS) is the most popular uremic toxin. However, how IS-induced astrocyte injury brings about neurologic complications in CKD patients has not been elucidated.
The rate of extracellular acidification was measured in astrocytes when IS (0.5-3 mM, 4 or 7 days) treatment was applied. The hexokinase 1 (HK1), pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and phosphofructokinase (PFKP) protein levels were also measured. The activation of the apoptotic pathway was investigated using a confocal microscope, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and cell three-dimensional imaging was used.
In astrocytes, IS affected glycolysis in not only dose-dependently but also time-dependently. Additionally, HK1, PKM2, PDH, and PFKP levels were decreased in IS-treated group when compared to the control. The results were prominent in cases with higher doses and longer exposure duration. The apoptotic features after IS treatment were also observed.
Our results showed that the inhibition of glycolysis by IS in astrocytes leads to cell death via apoptosis. Specifically, long-term and higher-dose exposures had more serious effects on astrocytes. Our results suggest that the glycolysis pathway and related targets could provide a novel approach to cognitive dysfunction in CKD patients.",brain injury

Adolescent athletes (N = 57; age = 14.70 ± 1.97) completed pre- and post-season clinical assessments and neuroimaging. Brain perfusion was evaluated using an advanced 3D pseudo-continuous ASL sequence with Hadamard encoded multiple post-labeling delays. Mixed-effect models tested group-by-time interactions for rCBF, ATT, and neurocognition.
A significant group-by-time interaction was observed for rCBF in a cluster consisting primarily of frontal and parietal lobe regions, with regional rCBF increasing in CS and decreasing among NCS athletes. No significant interaction was observed for ATT. A significant group-by-time interaction was observed for verbal memory and visual motor speed, with NCS athletes improving and CS athletes exhibiting lower performance from pre-to post-season in comparison.
Alterations in rCBF and variability in cognition, not purported neurovasculature changes (measured by ATT), were observed following one season of CS participation. Further study surrounding the clinical meaningfulness of these findings, as they related to adverse long-term outcomes, is needed.",brain injury
Formoterol attenuated mitochondrial dysfunction in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease in a rat model: Role of PINK-1/PARKIN and PI3K/Akt/CREB/BDNF/TrKB axis.,"['Haneen YKhidr', 'Noha FHassan', 'S SAbdelrahman', 'Mona REl-Ansary', 'Mohammed FEl-Yamany', 'Mostafa ARabie']","β2-adrenoreceptors (β2AR have been identified recently as regulators of the α-synuclein gene (SNCA), one of the key milieus endorsed in injury of dopamine neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD). Accumulation of α-synuclein leads to mitochondrial dysfunction via downregulation of mitophagy proteins (PINK-1 and PARKIN) and inhibition of mitochondria biogenesis (PGC-1α) along with an increase in the master inflammatory regulator NF-κB p65 production that provokes neurodegeneration and diminishes neuroprotective signaling pathway (PI3k/Akt/CREB/BDNF). Recently, formoterol exhibited a promising neuroprotective effect against neurodegenerative conditions associated with brain inflammation. Therefore, the present investigation aims to unveil the possible neuroprotective activity of formoterol, β2AR agonist, against rotenone-induced PD in rats. Rats received rotenone (1.5 mg/kg; s.c.) every other day for 3 weeks and cured with formoterol (25 μg/kg/day; i.p.) 1 hr. after rotenone administration, starting from day 11. Formoterol treatment succeeded in upregulating β2-adrenoreceptor expression in PD rats and preserving the function and integrity of dopaminergic neurons as witnessed by enhancement of muscular performance in tests, open field, grip strength-meter, and Rotarod, besides the increment in substantia nigra and striatal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoexpression. In parallel, formoterol boosted mitophagy by activation of PINK1 and PARKIN and preserved mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, formoterol stimulated the neuro-survival signaling axis via stimulation of PI3k/pS473-Akt/pS133-CREB/BDNF cascade to attenuate neuronal loss. Noteworthy formoterol reduces neuro-inflammatory status by decreasing NFκBp65 immunoexpression and TNF-α content. Finally, formoterol's potential as a stimulant therapy of mitophagy via the PINK1/PARKIN axis and regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing PGC-1α to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis along with stimulation of PI3k/Akt/CREB/BDNF axis.",brain injury
Torsemide vs Furosemide Among Patients With New-Onset vs Worsening Chronic Heart Failure: A Substudy of the TRANSFORM-HF Randomized Clinical Trial.,"['Selim RKrim', 'SenthilAnand', 'Stephen JGreene', 'AnqiChen', 'DanielWojdyla', 'JuanVilaro', 'HerbertHaught', 'John MHerre', 'Eric LEisenstein', 'Kevin JAnstrom', 'BertramPitt', 'Eric JVelazquez', 'Robert JMentz']","Differences in clinical profiles, outcomes, and diuretic treatment effects may exist between patients with de novo heart failure (HF) and worsening chronic HF (WHF).
To compare clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of torsemide vs furosemide in patients hospitalized with de novo HF vs WHF.
All patients with a documented ejection fraction who were randomized in the Torsemide Comparison With Furosemide for Management of Heart Failure (TRANSFORM-HF) trial, conducted from June 18 through March 2022, were included in this post hoc analysis. Study data were analyzed March to May 2023.
Patients were categorized by HF type and further divided by loop diuretic strategy.
End points included all-cause mortality and hospitalization outcomes over 12 months, as well as change from baseline in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS).
Among 2858 patients (mean [SD] age, 64.5 [14.0] years; 1803 male [63.1%]), 838 patients (29.3%) had de novo HF, and 2020 patients (70.7%) had WHF. Patients with de novo HF were younger (mean [SD] age, 60.6 [14.5] years vs 66.1 [13.5] years), had a higher glomerular filtration rate (mean [SD], 68.6 [24.9] vs 57.0 [24.0]), lower levels of natriuretic peptides (median [IQR], brain-type natriuretic peptide, 855.0 [423.0-1555.0] pg/mL vs 1022.0 [500.0-1927.0] pg/mL), and tended to be discharged on lower doses of loop diuretic (mean [SD], 50.3 [46.2] mg vs 63.8 [52.4] mg). De novo HF was associated with lower all-cause mortality at 12 months (de novo, 65 of 838 [9.1%] vs WHF, 408 of 2020 [25.4%]; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38-0.66; P < .001). Similarly, lower all-cause first rehospitalization at 12 months and greater improvement from baseline in KCCQ-CSS at 12 months were noted among patients with de novo HF (median [IQR]: de novo, 29.94 [27.35-32.54] vs WHF, 23.68 [21.62-25.74]; adjusted estimated difference in means: 6.26; 95% CI, 3.72-8.81; P < .001). There was no significant difference in mortality with torsemide vs furosemide in either de novo (No. of events [rate per 100 patient-years]: torsemide, 27 [7.4%] vs furosemide, 38 [10.9%]; aHR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.40-1.14; P = .15) or WHF (torsemide 212 [26.8%] vs furosemide, 196 [24.0%]; aHR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.89-1.32; P = .42; P for interaction = .10), In addition, no significant differences in hospitalizations, first all-cause hospitalization, or total hospitalizations at 12 months were noted with a strategy of torsemide vs furosemide in either de novo HF or WHF.
Among patients discharged after hospitalization for HF, de novo HF was associated with better clinical and patient-reported outcomes when compared with WHF. Regardless of HF type, there was no significant difference between torsemide and furosemide with respect to 12-month clinical or patient-reported outcomes.",brain injury
Combined Cognitive and Psychological Interventions Improve Meaningful Outcomes after Acquired Brain Injury: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"['AlexandraDavies', 'Jeffrey MRogers', 'KatharineBaker', 'LilyLi', 'JoshuaLlerena', 'Roshandas Nair', 'DanaWong']","Interventions addressing cognitive and emotional difficulties after acquired brain injury (ABI) often focus on specific impairments in cognition or mood. These interventions can be effective at addressing their specific target, but do not routinely translate to improved activity and participation outcomes. Approaches that combine cognitive and psychological rehabilitation are increasingly popular; however, to date, there have been no systematic evaluations of their efficacy. We conducted a systematic review of five databases, searching for randomised controlled trials of adults with diagnoses of non-progressive ABI at least 1-month post injury, in receipt of interventions that combined cognitive and psychological components compared to any control. Screening and data extraction were evaluated by two independent reviewers using a standardised protocol. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedge's g and estimated using a random-effects model. Risk of bias was assessed using the PEDro-P rating system, and quality of evidence evaluated using the grading of recommendation, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach. Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analysis (n = 684). There was an overall small-to-medium effect (g = 0.42) for combined interventions compared with controls, with gains maintained at 6-month follow-up. Improvements were observed at the level of impairment, activity, participation and quality of life. GRADE ratings and analyses investigating sensitivity, heterogeneity and publication bias indicated that these effects were robust. No a priori variables moderated these effects. Overall, this review provides strong evidence that combined cognitive and psychological interventions create meaningful change in the lives of people with ABI.",brain injury
Multi-modal MRI of hippocampal morphometry and connectivity after pediatric severe TBI.,"['Jose MGuerrero-Gonzalez', 'Gregory RKirk', 'RasmusBirn', 'Erin DBigler', 'KatherineBowen', 'Aimee TBroman', 'Bedda LRosario', 'WarwickButt', 'Sue RBeers', 'Michael JBell', 'Andrew LAlexander', 'Peter AFerrazzano', 'NoneNone']","This investigation explores memory performance using the California Verbal Learning Test in relation to morphometric and connectivity measures of the memory network in severe traumatic brain injury. Twenty-two adolescents with severe traumatic brain injury were recruited for multimodal MRI scanning 1-2 years post-injury at 13 participating sites. Analyses included hippocampal volume derived from anatomical T1-weighted imaging, fornix white matter microstructure from diffusion tensor imaging, and hippocampal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity as well as diffusion-based structural connectivity. A typically developing control cohort of forty-nine age-matched children also underwent scanning and neurocognitive assessment. Results showed hippocampus volume was decreased in traumatic brain injury with respect to controls. Further, hippocampal volume loss was associated with worse performance on memory and learning in traumatic brain injury subjects. Similarly, hippocampal fornix fractional anisotropy was reduced in traumatic brain injury with respect to controls, while decreased fractional anisotropy in the hippocampal fornix also was associated with worse performance on memory and learning in traumatic brain injury subjects. Additionally, reduced structural connectivity of left hippocampus to thalamus and calcarine sulcus was associated with memory and learning in traumatic brain injury subjects. Functional connectivity in the left hippocampal network was also associated with memory and learning in traumatic brain injury subjects. These regional findings from a multi-modal neuroimaging approach should not only be useful for gaining valuable insight into traumatic brain injury induced memory and learning disfunction, but may also be informative for monitoring injury progression, recovery, and for developing rehabilitation as well as therapy strategies.",brain injury
Modified Glucose-insulin-potassium Therapy for Hemorrhage-induced Traumatic Cardiac Arrest in Rabbits.,"['LinZhang', 'Wen-QiongDu', 'Zhao-WenZong', 'XinZhong', 'Yi-JunJia', 'Ren-QingJiang', 'ZhaoYe']","Resuscitation with whole blood is known to be better than that with saline in attaining the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and improving the short-term survival rate for hemorrhage-induced traumatic cardiac arrest (HiTCA). However, the resuscitation with whole blood alone fails to address the pathophysiological abnormalities, including hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia and coagulopathy, after HiTCA. The present study aimed to determine whether the modified glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) therapy can ameliorate the above-mentioned pathophysiological abnormalities, enhance the ROSC, improve the function of key organs, and reduce the mortality after HiTCA.
HiTCA was induced in rabbits (n=36) by controlled hemorrhage. Following arrest, the rabbits were randomly divided into three groups (n=12 each): group A (no resuscitation), group B (resuscitation with whole blood), and group C (resuscitation with whole blood plus GIK). The GIK therapy was administered based on the actual concentration of glucose and potassium. The ROSC rate and survival rate were obtained. Hemodynamical and biochemical changes were detected. Thromboelastography (TEG) was used to measure coagulation parameters, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect parameters related to inflammation, coagulation and the function of brain.
All animals in groups B and C attained ROSC. Two rabbits died 24-48 h after HiTCA in group B, while no rabbits died in group C. The GIK therapy significantly reduced the levels of blood glucose, potassium, and biological markers for inflammatory reaction, and improved the heart, kidney, liver and brain function in group C when compared to group B. Furthermore, the R values of TEG were significantly lower in group C than in group B, and the maximum amplitude of TEG was slightly lower in group B than in group C, with no significant difference found.
Resuscitation with whole blood and modified GIK therapy combined can ameliorate the pathophysiological disorders, including hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia and coagulopathy, and may improve the function of key organs after HiTCA.",brain injury
Sertraline Pre-Treatment Attenuates Hemorrhagic Transformation Induced in Rats after Cerebral Ischemia Reperfusion via Down Regulation of Neuronal CD163: Involvement of M1/M2 Polarization Interchange and Inhibiting Autophagy.,"['Shimaa KMohamed', 'Amany A EAhmed', 'AbeerElkhoely']","Cerebral ischemia reperfusion (I/R) is one of the neurovascular diseases which leads to severe brain deterioration. Haemorrhagic transformation (HT) is the main complication of ischemic stroke. It exacerbates by reperfusion, causing a more deleterious effect on the brain and death. The current study explored the protective effect of sertraline (Sert) against cerebral I/R in rats by inhibiting HT, together with the molecular pathways involved in this effect. Forty-eight wister male rats were divided into 4 groups: Sham, Sert + Sham, I/R, and Sert + I/R. The ischemic model was induced by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery for 20 min, then reperfusion for 24 h. Sertraline (20 mg/kg, p.o.) was administrated for 14 days before exposure to ischemia. Pre-treatment with Sert led to a significant attenuation of oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, Sert attenuated phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinases and nuclear factor kappa-p65 expression, consequently modulating microglial polarisation to M2 phenotype. Moreover, Sert prevented the hemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke as indicated by the notable decrease in neuronal expression of CD163, activity of Heme oxygenase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and 9 levels. In the same context, Sert decreased levels of autophagy and apoptotic markers. Furthermore, histological examination, Toluidine blue, and Prussian blue stain aligned with the results. In conclusion, Sert protected against cerebral I/R damage by attenuating oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy, and apoptotic process. It is worth mentioning that our study was the first to show that Sert inhibited hemorrhagic transformation.

Anti-inflammatory effects of antenatal administration of stem cell derived extracellular vesicles in the brain of rat fetuses with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.,"['MatisseBlundell', 'FabianDoktor', 'Rebeca LFigueira', 'KasraKhalaj', 'GeorgeBiouss', 'LinaAntounians', 'AugustoZani']","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) survivors may experience neurodevelopmental impairment, whose etiology remains elusive. Preclinical evidence indicates that amniotic fluid stem cell extracellular vesicle (AFSC-EV) administration promotes lung development but their effects on other organs are unknown. Herein, we investigated the brain of rat fetuses with CDH for signs of inflammation and response to AFSC-EVs.
CDH was induced by maternal nitrofen administration at E9.5. At E18.5, fetuses were injected intra-amniotically with saline or AFSC-EVs (isolated by ultracentrifugation, characterized as per MISEV guidelines). Fetuses from vehicle-gavaged dams served as controls. Groups were compared for: lung hypoplasia, TNFa and IL-1B brain expression, and activated microglia (Iba1) density in the subgranular zone (SGZ).
CDH lungs had fewer airspaces compared to controls, whereas AFSC-EV-treated lungs had rescued branching morphogenesis. Fluorescently labeled AFSC-EVs injected intra-amniotically into CDH fetuses had fluorescent signal in the brain. Compared to controls, the brain of CDH fetuses had higher TNFa and IL-1B levels, and increased activated microglia density. Conversely, the brain of AFSC-EV treated fetuses had inflammatory marker expression levels and microglia density similar to controls.
This study shows that the brain of rat fetuses with CDH has signs of inflammation that are abated by the intra-amniotic administration of AFSC-EVs.",brain injury
"HH-A, a modified honokiol, protects against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion induced brain injury in rodent via Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways.","['YuyingZhang', 'PingpingZhang', 'XinZhang', 'YeLiu']","Honokiol, a bioactive component found in Magnolia officinalis, has shown in protecting against ischemic stroke in animal models. However, its poor water solubility has limited its clinical applications. In this study, we introduced a hydrophilic building block on the aromatic ring of honokiol, resulting in the synthesis of four new compounds (HH-A, -B, -C and -D) with significantly improved water solubility. We then investigated the neuroprotective effects of these compounds in mouse and rat models of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (tMCAO/R) brain injury. Among the compounds tested, HH-A, also known as (S)-6-((3',5-diallyl-2,4'-dihydroxy-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-yl)amino)-6-oxohexane-1,5-diaminium chloride, showed the most promising results. HH-A was found to significantly reduced the infarct volume and brain edema in mice. It also outperformed the other three compounds and honokiol, even surpassing the effects of edaravone dexborneol. Additionally, HH-A demonstrated dose-dependent improvements in body weight, neurological deficits, and infarct volume. Further analysis in tMCAO/R rat model revealed that HH-A treatment led to significant upregulations of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the brain. HH-A also significantly reduced the expression of HNE, and exhibited anti-apoptotic effects by decreasing the expression of Bax and increasing the expression of Bcl-2. This was further supported by a decrease in the number of TUNEL positive cells. Taken together, the neuroprotective effects of HH-A may be attributed to its ability to target the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, leading to reduced oxidative stress and apoptosis in the brain. These findings suggest that HH-A has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of ischemic stroke.",brain injury
Dynamic alternations of interhemispheric functional connectivity in brachial plexus avulsion injury patients with nerve transfer: a resting state fMRI study.,"['YangYang', 'TieLi', 'YanDeng', 'JunlongWang', 'YajieLi', 'HanqiuLiu', 'WeiweiWang']","Brachial plexus avulsion injury (BPAI) is a severe peripheral nerve injury that leads to functional reorganization of the brain. However, the interhemispheric coordination following contralateral cervical 7 nerve transfer remains unclear. In this study, 69 BPAI patients underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging examination to assess the voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC), which reveals the interhemispheric functional connection. The motor function of the affected upper extremity was measured using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) scale. The VMHC analysis showed significant differences between the bilateral precentral gyrus, supplementary motor area (SMA), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and insula. Compared to the preoperative group, the VMHC of the precentral gyrus significantly increased in the postoperative short-term group (PO-ST group) but decreased in the postoperative long-term group (PO-LT group). Additionally, the VMHC of the SMA significantly increased in the PO-LT group. Furthermore, the VMHC of the precentral gyrus in the PO-ST group and the SMA in the PO-LT group were positively correlated with the FMA-UE scores. These findings highlight a positive relationship between motor recovery and increased functional connectivity of precentral gyrus and SMA, which provide possible therapeutic targets for future neuromodulation interventions to improve rehabilitation outcomes for BPAI patients.",brain injury

The National Institutes of Health-supported Benchmark Evidence from Latin America-Treatment of Raised Intracranial Pressure-Pediatrics trial will compare outcomes from pediatric sTBI of a management protocol based on ICP monitoring vs 1 based on imaging and clinical examination without monitoring. Because no applicable comprehensive management algorithms for either cohort are available, it was necessary to develop them.
A consensus conference involving the 21 intensivists and neurosurgeons from the 8 trial sites used Delphi-based methodology to formulate management algorithms for both study cohorts. We included recommendations from the latest Brain Trauma Foundation pediatric sTBI guidelines and the consensus-based adult algorithms (Seattle International Brain Injury Consensus Conference/Consensus Revised Imaging and Clinical Examination) wherever relevant. We used a consensus threshold of 80%.
We developed comprehensive management algorithms for monitored and nonmonitored cohort children with sTBI. We defined suspected intracranial hypertension for the nonmonitored group, set minimum number and timing of computed tomography scans, specified minimal age-adjusted mean arterial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure targets, defined clinical neuroworsening, described minimal requisites for intensive care unit management, produced tiered management algorithms for both groups, and listed treatments not routinely used.
We will study these protocols in the Benchmark Evidence from Latin America-Treatment of Raised Intracranial Pressure-Pediatrics trial in low- and middle-income countries. Second, we present them here for consideration as prototype pediatric sTBI management algorithms in the absence of published alternatives, acknowledging their limited evidentiary status.

Demethylnobiletin ameliorates cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats through Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.,"['DanHuang', 'Ali Chyadmarzok AlAwad', 'ChuaiTang', 'YunqiangChen']","Demethylnobiletin (DN), with a variety of biological activities, is a polymethoxy-flavanone (PMF) found in citrus. In the present study, we explored the biological activities and potential mechanism of DN to improve cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury (CIRI) in rats, and identified DN as a novel neuroprotective agent for patients with ischemic brain injury.
Rat CIRI models were established via middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Primary nerve cells were isolated and cultured in fetal rat cerebral cortex in vitro, and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) models of primary nerve cells were induced. After intervention with DN with different concentrations in MCAO rats and OGD/R nerve cells, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to quantify cerebral infarction size in CIRI rats. Modified neurological severity score was utilized to assess neurological performance. Histopathologic staining and live/dead cell-viability staining was used to observe apoptosis. Levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in tissues and cells were detected using commercial kits. DN level in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of MCAO rats were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, expression levels of proteins like Kelch like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nfr2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and apoptosis-related proteins like Cleaved caspase-3, BCL-2-associated X protein (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence.
DN can significantly enhance neurological function recovery by reducing cerebral infarction size and weakening neurocytes apoptosis in MCAO rats. It was further found that DN could improve oxidative stress (OS) injury of nerve cells by bringing down MDA and ROS levels and increasing SOD and GSH levels. Notably, DN exerts its pharmacological influences through entering blood-brain barrier. Mechanically, DN can reduce Keap1 expression while activate Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in neurocytes.
The protective effect of DN on neurocytes have been demonstrated in both in vitro and in vivo circumstances. It deserves to be developed as a potential neuroprotective agent through regulating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway to ameliorate neurocytes impairment caused by OS.",brain injury
Association between opioid use during mechanical ventilation in preterm infants and evidence of brain injury: a propensity score-matched cohort study.,"['LisaSzatkowski', 'DonSharkey', 'HelenBudge', 'ShaliniOjha']","Preterm infants often require mechanical ventilation (MV), which can be a painful experience. Opioids (such as morphine) are used to provide analgesia, despite conflicting evidence about their impact on the developing brain. We aimed to quantify the use of opioids during MV in infants born at <32 weeks' gestational age and to investigate the association between opioid use and evidence of brain injury.
In this retrospective propensity score-matched cohort study, we used routinely recorded data from the National Neonatal Research Database to study infants born at 22-31 weeks gestational age who were admitted to neonatal units in England and Wales (between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2020) and who were mechanically ventilated on one or more days during their hospital stay. We used propensity score matching to identify pairs of infants (one who received opioids during MV and one who did not) with similar demographic and clinical characteristics. The pre-specified primary outcome was preterm brain injury assessed in all infants who received MV for more than two days and had evidence of preterm brain injury at or before discharge from neonatal care. Adjusted analyses accounted for differences in infants' characteristics, including illness severity and painful/surgical conditions.
Of 67,206 infants included, 45,193 (67%) were mechanically ventilated for one or more days and 26,201 (58% of 45,193) received an opioid whilst ventilated. Opioids were given for a median of 67% of ventilated days (IQR 43-92%) and the median exposure was 4 days (2-11). The percentage of mechanically ventilated infants who received opioids while ventilated increased from 52% in 2012 to 60% in 2020 (morphine, 51%-56%; fentanyl, 6%-18%). In the propensity score-matched cohort of 3608 pairs who were ventilated for >2 consecutive days, the odds of any preterm brain injury (adjusted odds ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.10-1.35) were higher in those who received opioids compared with those who did not (received opioids, 990/3608 (27.4%) vs. did not receive opioids, 855/3608 (23.7%). The adjusted odds of these adverse outcomes increased with increasing number of days of opioid exposure.
Use of opioids during mechanical ventilation of preterm infants increased during the study period (2012-2020). Although causation cannot be determined, among those ventilated for >2 consecutive days, these data suggest that opioid use is associated with an increased risk of preterm brain injury and the risk increases with longer durations of exposure.

"In humans, striato-pallido-thalamic projections are largely segregated by their origin in either the striosome-like or matrix-like compartments.","['Adrian TFunk', 'Asim A OHassan', 'NorbertBrüggemann', 'NutanSharma', 'Hans CBreiter', 'Anne JBlood', 'Jeff LWaugh']","Cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) loops are fundamental organizing units in mammalian brains. CSTCs process limbic, associative, and sensorimotor information in largely separated but interacting networks. CTSC loops pass through paired striatal compartments, striosome (aka patch) and matrix, segregated pools of medium spiny projection neurons with distinct embryologic origins, cortical/subcortical structural connectivity, susceptibility to injury, and roles in behaviors and diseases. Similarly, striatal dopamine modulates activity in striosome and matrix in opposite directions. Routing CSTCs through one compartment may be an anatomical basis for regulating discrete functions. We used differential structural connectivity, identified through probabilistic diffusion tractography, to distinguish the striatal compartments (striosome-like and matrix-like voxels) in living humans. We then mapped compartment-specific projections and quantified structural connectivity between each striatal compartment, the globus pallidus interna (GPi), and 20 thalamic nuclei in 221 healthy adults. We found that striosome-originating and matrix-originating streamlines were segregated within the GPi: striosome-like connectivity was significantly more rostral, ventral, and medial. Striato-pallido-thalamic streamline bundles that were seeded from striosome-like and matrix-like voxels transited spatially distinct portions of the white matter. Matrix-like streamlines were 5.7-fold more likely to reach the GPi, replicating animal tract-tracing studies. Striosome-like connectivity dominated in six thalamic nuclei (anteroventral, central lateral, laterodorsal, lateral posterior, mediodorsal-medial, and medial geniculate). Matrix-like connectivity dominated in seven thalamic nuclei (centromedian, parafascicular, pulvinar-anterior, pulvinar-lateral, ventral lateral-anterior, ventral lateral-posterior, ventral posterolateral). Though we mapped all thalamic nuclei independently, functionally-related nuclei were matched for compartment-level bias. We validated these results with prior thalamostriate tract tracing studies in non-human primates and other species; where reliable data was available, all agreed with our measures of structural connectivity. Matrix-like connectivity was lateralized (left > right hemisphere) in 18 thalamic nuclei, independent of handedness, diffusion protocol, sex, or whether the nucleus was striosome-dominated or matrix-dominated. Compartment-specific biases in striato-pallido-thalamic structural connectivity suggest that routing CSTC loops through striosome-like or matrix-like voxels is a fundamental mechanism for organizing and regulating brain networks. Our MRI-based assessments of striato-thalamic connectivity in humans match and extend the results of prior tract tracing studies in animals. Compartment-level characterization may improve localization of human neuropathologies and improve neurosurgical targeting in the GPi and thalamus.",brain injury
The Impact of Non-opioid Analgesic Usage on Total Opioid Load During Traumatic Brain Injury Rehabilitation: A Retrospective Study.,"['Joshua DKing', 'KyloCautivar', 'Duc ATran', 'MohammadAli', 'NicholasSchmidt', 'MichelleMcSkane', 'EugenePak']","Background Patients staying in acute rehabilitation often use large amounts of opioids during their stay. There are a number of reasons for this increased opioid exposure, including but not limited to daily exercises with physical and occupational therapists, increased demand on a healing body, and use of previously atrophying musculature. Some physiatrists have noticed that patients who concurrently are prescribed medications such as Robaxin seem to require fewer opioids during their stay in acute rehabilitation. This study aimed to determine the association between non-opioid analgesic use and total opioid load, as measured using morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs), during inpatient rehabilitation for traumatic brain injury. Methodology A retrospective study of individuals with a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury admitted to an acute inpatient rehabilitation program was performed. Non-opioid medications that were reviewed in the study included acetaminophen, amitriptyline, baclofen, diclofenac, gabapentin, ibuprofen, lidocaine, methocarbamol, nortriptyline, and pregabalin. Five of the most-used non-opioid medications (acetaminophen, diclofenac, gabapentin, lidocaine, and methocarbamol) were statistically analyzed using regression and analysis of variance to evaluate for any significant variables. Results Results showed that the average daily dose of acetaminophen has a significant effect on the average daily MME and that the average daily dose of gabapentin and methocarbamol each have a significant effect on the change of daily MME usage from admission to discharge from acute rehab (ΔMME). Results also showed that the mere presence of methocarbamol (regardless of daily or total dosage) had a significant effect on the ΔMME. Conclusions Based on these findings, physicians may want to consider prescribing acetaminophen, gabapentin, or methocarbamol for patients admitted for inpatient rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury who require high amounts of opioids.",brain injury

We present a case of a 79-year-old woman with no prior seizure history, who was admitted for Pseudomonas aeruginosa surgical wound infection for which she was on cefepime. She developed acute encephalopathy with associated, occasional, right-sided myoclonic facial twitches 11 days into her admission. Electroencephalogram (EEG) confirmed NCSE as evident by epileptiform activity described as generalized periodic discharges with predominantly triphasic morphology. Cefepime was substituted with piperacillin-tazobactam> 24 hours after symptom onset. NCSE completely resolved two days after the discontinuation of cefepime. This case highlights the fact that NCSE can occur even when precautions such as renal dosing of cefepime are observed. Clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion for the condition when taking care of at-risk patients on cefepime, as delayed diagnosis correlates with potentially fatal outcomes.",brain injury
Sex differences in neonatal brain injury and inflammation.,"['Lynne AKelly', 'AoifeBranagan', 'GerganaSemova', 'Eleanor JMolloy']","Neonatal brain injury and associated inflammation is more common in males. There is a well-recognised difference in incidence and outcome of neonatal encephalopathy according to sex with a pronounced male disadvantage. Neurodevelopmental differences manifest from an early age in infancy with females having a lower incidence of developmental delay and learning difficulties in comparison with males and male sex has consistently been identified as a risk factor for cerebral palsy in epidemiological studies. Important neurobiological differences exist between the sexes with respect to neuronal injury which are especially pronounced in preterm neonates. There are many potential reasons for these sex differences including genetic, immunological and hormonal differences but there are limited studies of neonatal immune response. Animal models with induced neonatal hypoxia have shown various sex differences including an upregulated immune response and increased microglial activation in males. Male sex is recognized to be a risk factor for neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) during the perinatal period and this review discusses in detail the sex differences in brain injury in preterm and term neonates and some of the potential new therapies with possible sex affects.",brain injury

Access to Rehabilitation After Hospitalization for Traumatic Brain Injury: A National Longitudinal Cohort Study in Sweden.,"['AndreaKlang', 'YasminaMolero', 'PaulLichtenstein', 'HenrikLarsson', ""Brian MatthewD'Onofrio"", 'NiklasMarklund', 'ChristianOldenburg', 'ElhamRostami']","Rehabilitation is suggested to improve outcomes following traumatic brain injury (TBI), however, the extent of access to rehabilitation among TBI patients remains unclear.
To examine the level of access to rehabilitation after TBI, and its association with health and sociodemographic factors.
We conducted a longitudinal cohort study using Swedish nationwide healthcare and sociodemographic registers. We identified 15 880 TBI patients ≥18 years hospitalized ≥3 days from 2008 to 2012 who were stratified into 3 severity groups; grade I (n = 1366; most severe), grade II (n = 5228), and grade III (n = 9268; least severe). We examined registered contacts with specialized rehabilitation or geriatric care (for patients ≥65 years) during the hospital stay, and/or within 1 year post-discharge. We performed a generalized linear model analysis to estimate the risk ratio (RR) for receiving specialized rehabilitation or geriatric care after a TBI based on sociodemographic and health factors.
Among TBI patients, 46/35% (grade I), 14/40% (grade II), and 5/18% (grade III) received specialized rehabilitation or geriatric care, respectively. Being currently employed or studying was positively associated (RR 1.7, 2.3), while living outside of a city area was negatively associated (RR 0.36, 0.79) with receiving specialized rehabilitation or geriatric care. Older age and a prior substance use disorder were negatively associated with receiving specialized rehabilitation (RR 0.51 and 0.81).
Our results suggest insufficient and unequal access to rehabilitation for TBI patients, highlighting the importance of organizing and standardizing post-TBI rehabilitation to meet the needs of patients, regardless of their age, socioeconomic status, or living area.",brain injury
Correlation of sLOX-1 and CSF1 with the pathological progression of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in neonatal rats.,"['JunHuang', 'WentaoJiang', 'JunpingPan', 'XuetaoXu']","To provide clinical evidence for the management of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) by analyzing the role of soluble lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (sLOX-1) and colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) in the disease. We purchased 15 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat pups and randomized them into five groups (n=3), of which one group was untreated as the control group and the other four were modeled by HIE. After modeling, a group was treated as a model group without any treatment, another group was injected with sLOX-1-silencing lentiviral vector (sLOX-1-si group), and the third and fourth were injected with CSF1-silencing lentiviral vector (CSF1-si group) and an equal amount of normal saline (blank group), respectively. After the corresponding intervention, the rat tissue in each group was obtained to observe the pathological injury by HE and TUNEL staining. In addition, sLOX-1, CSF1, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE) levels in brain tissue of each group were determined. The model group showed more severe pathological damage of the hippocampus and higher neuronal apoptosis than the control group. Besides, higher sLOX-1 and CSF1 levels and lower 5-HT, DA and NE contents were identified in the model group versus the control group (P<0.05). Compared with the blank group, sLOX-1-si and CSF1-si groups showed significantly alleviated hippocampal damage, inhibited neuronal apoptosis, reduced 5-HT, DA, NE, Bax, and cl-caspase-3, and increased Bcl-2 (P<0.05).

Whole brain irradiation-induced endothelial dysfunction in the mouse brain.,"['TamasKiss', 'AnnaUngvari', 'RafalGulej', 'ÁdámNyúl-Tóth', 'StefanoTarantini', 'ZoltanBenyo', 'BoglarkaCsik', 'AndriyYabluchanskiy', 'PeterMukli', 'AnnaCsiszar', 'ZoltanUngvari']","Whole brain irradiation (WBI), also known as whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT), is a well-established treatment for multiple brain metastases and as a preventive measure to reduce the risk of recurrence after surgical removal of a cerebral metastasis. However, WBI has been found to lead to a gradual decline in neurocognitive function in approximately 50% of patients who survive the treatment, significantly impacting their overall quality of life. Recent preclinical investigations have shed light on the underlying mechanisms of this adverse effect, revealing a complex cerebrovascular injury that involves the induction of cellular senescence in various components of the neurovascular unit, including endothelial cells. The emergence of cellular senescence following WBI has been implicated in the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and impairment of neurovascular coupling responses following irradiation. Building upon these findings, the present study aims to test the hypothesis that WBI-induced endothelial injury promotes endothelial dysfunction, which mimics the aging phenotype. To investigate this hypothesis, we employed a clinically relevant fractionated WBI protocol (5 Gy twice weekly for 4 weeks) on young mice. Both the WBI-treated and control mice were fitted with a cranial window, enabling the assessment of microvascular endothelial function. In order to evaluate the endothelium-dependent, NO-mediated cerebral blood flow (CBF) responses, we topically administered acetylcholine and ATP, and measured the resulting changes using laser Doppler flowmetry. We found that the increases in regional CBF induced by acetylcholine and ATP were significantly diminished in mice subjected to WBI. These findings provide additional preclinical evidence supporting the notion that WBI induces dysfunction in cerebrovascular endothelial cells, which in turn likely contributes to the detrimental long-term effects of the treatment. This endothelial dysfunction resembles an accelerated aging phenotype in the cerebrovascular system and is likely causally linked to the development of cognitive impairment. By integrating these findings with our previous results, we have deepened our understanding of the lasting consequences of WBI. Moreover, our study underscores the critical role of cerebromicrovascular health in safeguarding cognitive function over the long term. This enhanced understanding highlights the importance of prioritizing cerebromicrovascular health in the context of preserving cognitive abilities.",brain injury
Neurodegenerative Etiology of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency: a Novel Concept for Expanding Treatment Strategies.,['ZohiSternberg'],"Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADC-DY) is caused by one or more mutations in the DDC gene, resulting in the deficit in catecholamines and serotonin neurotransmitters. The disease has limited therapeutic options with relatively poor clinical outcomes. Accumulated evidence suggests the involvement of neurodegenerative mechanisms in the etiology of AADC-DY. In the absence of neurotransmitters' neuroprotective effects, the accumulation and the chronic presence of several neurotoxic metabolites including 4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine, 3-methyldopa, and homocysteine, in the brain of subjects with AADC-DY, promote oxidative stress and reduce the cellular antioxidant and methylation capacities, leading to glial activation and mitochondrial dysfunction, culminating to neuronal injury and death. These pathophysiological processes have the potential to hinder the clinical efficacy of treatments aimed at increasing neurotransmitters' synthesis and or function. This review describes in detail the mechanisms involved in AADC-DY neurodegenerative etiology, highlighting the close similarities with those involved in other neurodegenerative diseases. We then offer novel strategies for the treatment of the disease with the objective to either reduce the level of the metabolites or counteract their prooxidant and neurotoxic effects. These treatment modalities used singly or in combination, early in the course of the disease, will minimize neuronal injury, preserving the functional integrity of neurons, hence improving the clinical outcomes of both conventional and unconventional interventions in AADC-DY. These modalities may not be limited to AADC-DY but also to other metabolic disorders where a specific mutation leads to the accumulation of prooxidant and neurotoxic metabolites.",brain injury
Neurophobia Amongst Medical Students: Is Virtual Teaching the Answer?,"['Dr PrabhjotSingh Malhotra', 'Dr MaxBennett', 'Dr LuciaYin', 'Dr LukeWhiting', 'Dr RobinaRobbie Singh', 'Dr JanSindhar']","'Neurophobia' is well-recognised to dissuade medical students from the neuro-centric specialities and limit the success of neurology and neurosurgery teaching at medical school. Past studies have associated neurophobia with deficiencies in medical education.
We performed a cross-sectional analysis on medical students' confidence and perceived level of knowledge in recognising the following neurosurgical and neurological emergencies- ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke, status epilepticus, subarachnoid haemorrhage, raised intracranial pressure, acute hydrocephalus, spinal cord injury, cauda equina syndrome and traumatic brain injury. Additionally, we assessed the utility of virtual seminars in neurosurgery and neurology teaching.
Medical students from King's College London were invited to a virtual teaching session. We obtained pre- and post- teaching scores for students' subjective ability to recognise specific neurological and neurosurgical emergencies, along with their confidence in the subject.
97 medical students attended the teaching session. For our sample group's subjective rating on their confidence in neurology or neurosurgery as a subject, we obtained a mean score of 3.87 and a median score of 4. Across all domains, there was a significant forward shift in the distribution curve of scores post-teaching. We obtained statistically significant differences for all 9 neurological and neurosurgical emergencies evaluated in our questionnaire (Asymp.Sig. <0.001). Median scores for all 9 conditions improved after the teaching session, with >50% positive ranks seen within each group. Across the teaching modalities compared; placement-teaching was the highest scoring while online lectures received a better rating than in-person lectures.
In neurosurgery teaching, virtual seminars may compensate for deficiencies that currently exist within medical education, hence limiting the effects of neurophobia.",brain injury
Cost Associated with Geriatric TBI in Developing Countries: An Observational Study.,"['AdhamAl Rahbi', 'OmarAl Mahrouqi', 'HashimAl Ibrahim', 'MaryamAl Saidi', 'YusraAbid Shah', 'TariqAl-Saadi']","Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) in the geriatric population is a serious public health problem and has a huge impact on mortality and morbidity.
A retrospective cohort study including patients aged above 65 admitted to a tertiary specialized trauma center, in the period from January 2016 to 31 December 2019. The data collected includes patients' demographics, diagnosis, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on arrival, length of stay (LOS), investigations, and type of surgery done.
Total number of TBI cases in our study is 145. The most frequent single diagnosis was subdural hematoma (SDH) (85). Subsequently, it was the costliest diagnosis with an average cost of 3569 USD per patient. LOS on average was 17.11±41 hours, with the majority (109 patients) having non-prolonged hospital stay (< 14 days). Most of those managed by observation have below-average costs compared to other patients (p < 0.001). Complete Blood Count (CBC) was the highly requested test with a total cost 5070 $ in the study period. And head CT had the highest total cost 58864 $. 21 craniotomies and 30 burr holes were made with a total cost of 30000 and 25325 respectively. Patients with lower GCS (64.6%) have below-average hospitalization costs compared to those who got high GCS scores (p < 0.001).
This study provides the first estimates of the financial burden of Geriatric TBI in the region, which signifies the importance of developing strategies to prevent TBIs and help in resource allocation and healthcare policy formation.",brain injury
Periplaneta Americana (L.) extract activates the ERK/CREB/BDNF pathway to promote post-stroke neuroregeneration and recovery of neurological functions in rats.,"['JiangyanRao', 'HongpuLi', 'HaonanZhang', 'XiaoxiaXiang', 'XinyuDing', 'LiLi', 'FunengGeng', 'HongyiQi']","Periplaneta americana (L.) (PA) has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years for the effect of invigorating blood circulation and removing blood stasis. Modern pharmacological research shown that PA extract exhibits promising effects in promoting wound healing and regeneration, as well as in brain diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). However, whether it is effective for neuroregeneration and neurological function recovery after stroke still unknown.
This study aims to investigate the potential effect of PA extract to promote brain remodeling through the activation of endogenous neurogenesis and angiogenesis, in addition, preliminary exploration of its regulatory mechanism.
Firstly, BrdU proliferation assay and immunofluorescence (IF) staining were used to evaluate the effect of PA extract on the neurogenesis and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, the effects of PA extract on brain injury in stroke rats were assessed by TTC and HE. While mNSS score, adhesive removal test, rota-rod test, and morris water maze test were used to assess the impact of PA extract on neurological function in post-stroke rats. Finally, the molecular mechanisms of PA extract regulation were explored by RNA-Seq and western blotting.

Virtual lesions in MEG reveal increasing vulnerability of the language network from early childhood through adolescence.,"['Brady JWilliamson', 'Hansel MGreiner', 'Darren SKadis']","In childhood, language outcomes following brain injury are inversely related to age. Neuroimaging findings suggest that extensive representation and/or topological redundancy may confer the pediatric advantage. Here, we assess whole brain and language network resilience using in silico attacks, for 85 children participating in a magnetoencephalography (MEG) study. Nodes are targeted based on eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality, or at random. The size of each connected component is assessed after iterated node removal; the percolation point, or moment of dis-integration, is defined as the first instance where the second largest component peaks in size. To overcome known effects of fixed thresholding on subsequent graph and resilience analyses, we study percolation across all possible network densities, within a Functional Data Analysis (FDA) framework. We observe age-related increases in vulnerability for random and betweenness centrality-based attacks for whole-brain and stories networks (adjusted-p < 0.05). Here we show that changes in topology underlie increasing language network vulnerability in development.",brain injury
Emergence of task-related spatiotemporal population dynamics in transplanted neurons.,"['HarmanGhuman', 'KyungsooKim', 'SapeedaBarati', 'KaruneshGanguly']","Loss of nervous system tissue after severe brain injury is a main determinant of poor functional recovery. Cell transplantation is a promising method to restore lost tissue and function, yet it remains unclear if transplanted neurons can demonstrate the population level dynamics important for movement control. Here we present a comprehensive approach for long-term single neuron monitoring and manipulation of transplanted embryonic cortical neurons after cortical injury in adult male mice performing a prehension task. The observed patterns of population activity in the transplanted network strongly resembled that of healthy networks. Specifically, the task-related spatiotemporal activity patterns of transplanted neurons could be represented by latent factors that evolve within a low dimensional manifold. We also demonstrate reliable modulation of the transplanted networks using minimally invasive epidural stimulation. Our approach may allow greater insight into how restoration of cell-type specific network dynamics in vivo can restore motor function.",brain injury
Infiltrating myeloid cell-derived properdin markedly promotes microglia-mediated neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke.,"['Pin-YiLiu', 'Hui-QinLi', 'Meng-QiDong', 'Xin-YaGu', 'Si-YiXu', 'Sheng-NanXia', 'Xin-YuBao', 'YunXu', 'XiangCao']","Emerging evidence has shown that myeloid cells that infiltrate into the peri-infarct region may influence the progression of ischemic stroke by interacting with microglia. Properdin, which is typically secreted by immune cells such as neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells, has been found to possess damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) properties and can perform functions unrelated to the complement pathway. However, the role of properdin in modulating microglia-mediated post-stroke neuroinflammation remains unclear.
Global and conditional (myeloid-specific) properdin-knockout mice were subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Histopathological and behavioral tests were performed to assess ischemic brain injury in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing and immunofluorescence staining were applied to explore the source and the expression level of properdin. The transcriptomic profile of properdin-activated primary microglia was depicted by transcriptome sequencing. Lentivirus was used for macrophage-inducible C-type lectin (Mincle) silencing in microglia. Conditioned medium from primary microglia was administered to primary cortex neurons to determine the neurotoxicity of microglia. A series of cellular and molecular biological techniques were used to evaluate the proinflammatory response, neuronal death, protein-protein interactions, and related signaling pathways, etc. RESULTS: The level of properdin was significantly increased, and brain-infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages were the main sources of properdin in the ischemic brain. Global and conditional myeloid knockout of properdin attenuated microglial overactivation and inflammatory responses at the acute stage of tMCAO in mice. Accordingly, treatment with recombinant properdin enhanced the production of proinflammatory cytokines and augmented microglia-potentiated neuronal death in primary culture. Mechanistically, recombinant properdin served as a novel ligand that activated Mincle receptors on microglia and downstream pathways to drive primary microglia-induced inflammatory responses. Intriguingly, properdin can directly bind to the microglial Mincle receptor to exert the above effects, while Mincle knockdown limits properdin-mediated microglial inflammation.
Properdin is a new medium by which infiltrating peripheral myeloid cells communicate with microglia, further activate microglia, and exacerbate brain injury in the ischemic brain, suggesting that targeted disruption of the interaction between properdin and Mincle on microglia or inhibition of their downstream signaling may improve the prognosis of ischemic stroke.",brain injury

Silica nanoparticles containing nano-silver and chlorhexidine respond to pH to suppress biofilm acids and modulate biofilms toward a non-cariogenic composition.,"['SupingWang', 'LixinFang', 'HuoxiangZhou', 'ManWang', 'HaoZheng', 'YiyiWang', 'Michael DWeir', 'RadiMasri', 'Thomas WOates', 'LeiCheng', 'Hockin H KXu', 'FeiLiu']","Dental caries is caused by acids from biofilms. pH-sensitive nanoparticle carriers could achieve improved targeted effectiveness. The objectives of this study were to develop novel mesoporous silica nanoparticles carrying nanosilver and chlorhexidine (nMS-nAg-Chx), and investigate the inhibition of biofilms as well as the modulation of biofilm to suppress acidogenic and promote benign species for the first time.
nMS-nAg was synthesized via a modified sol-gel method. Carboxylate group functionalized nMS-nAg (COOH-nMS-nAg) was prepared and Chx was added via electrostatic interaction. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), inhibition zone, and growth curves were evaluated. Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii), and Streptococcus sanguinis (S. sanguinis) formed multispecies biofilms. Metabolic activity, biofilm lactic acid, exopolysaccharides (EPS), and TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were tested. Biofilm structures and biomass were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and live/dead bacteria staining.
nMS-nAg-Chx possessed pH-responsive properties, where Chx release increased at lower pH. nMS-nAg-Chx showed good biocompatibility. nMS-nAg-Chx exhibited a strong antibacterial function, reducing biofilm metabolic activity and lactic acid as compared to control (p < 0.05, n = 6). Moreso, biofilm biomass was dramatically suppressed in nMS-nAg-Chx groups. In control group, there was an increasing trend of S. mutans proportion in the multispecies biofilm, with S. mutans reaching 89.1% at 72 h. In sharp contrast, in nMS-nAg-Chx group of 25 μg/mL, the ratio of S. mutans dropped to 43.7% and the proportion of S. gordonii and S. sanguinis increased from 19.8% and 10.9 to 69.8% and 56.3%, correspondingly.
pH-sensitive nMS-nAg-Chx had potent antibacterial effects and modulated biofilm toward a non-cariogenic tendency, decreasing the cariogenic species nearly halved and increasing the benign species approximately twofold. nMS-nAg-Chx is promising for applications in mouth rinse and endodontic irrigants, and as fillers in resins to prevent caries.",brain injury

Ultrasound examination of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) is considered a potential, non-invasive, and effective method for assessing ICP. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of ONSD ultrasound detection and invasive ICP monitoring methods to compare and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ONSD ultrasound detection methods for intracranial hypertension (IH) in patients with TBI.
We searched the Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ONSD sonography for predicting increased ICP. The two authors independently extracted the collected data. Simultaneously, the QUADAS-2 tool was used to evaluate the bias risk of each study and conducted random-effects meta-analyses for the accuracy and specificity of diagnosis, and calculated pooled estimates.
Ten studies with 512 patients were included. The diagnostic accuracy of ONSD sonography for IH was revealed as a pooled sensitivity of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.89) and specificity of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80-0.93), compared with the invasive ICP monitoring standard for patients with TBI.

Injury-dependent and -independent mechanisms have provided important insight into neuronal regeneration, however, common denominators underpinning regeneration remain elusive. A comparative analysis of transcriptomic datasets associated with neuronal regenerative ability revealed circadian rhythms as the most significantly enriched pathway. Subsequently, we demonstrated that sensory neurons possess an endogenous clock and that their regenerative ability displays diurnal oscillations in a murine model of sciatic nerve injury. Consistently, transcriptomic analysis showed a time-of-day-dependent enrichment for processes associated with axonal regeneration and the circadian clock. Conditional deletion experiments demonstrated that Bmal1 is required for neuronal intrinsic circadian regeneration and target re-innervation. Lastly, lithium enhanced nerve regeneration in wild-type but not in clock-deficient mice. Together, these findings demonstrate that the molecular clock fine-tunes the regenerative ability of sensory neurons and propose compounds affecting clock pathways as a novel approach to nerve repair.",brain injury

Additionally, anxiety-like behavior and hippocampal-associated spatial learning and memory impairment were found in the elevated plus maze and in the Barnes maze, respectively. Levels of a set of inflammatory mediators and neurotrophic factors were analyzed at 6 h, 24 h, 72 h, and 30 days after injury in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Principal components analysis revealed two principal components (PC), which represented 59.1% of data variability. PC1 (cytokines and chemokines) expression varied between both hemispheres, while PC2 (neurotrophic factors) expression varied only across the investigated brain areas.

Automatic Quantification of Enlarged Perivascular Space in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury Using Super-resolution of T2-weighted Images.,"['JiachenZhuo', 'PrashantRaghavan', 'MuhanShao', 'Steven RRoys', 'XiaoLiang', 'Rosy LindaNjonkou Tchoquessi', 'ChandlerSours Rhodes', 'NeerajBadjatia', 'JerryPrince', 'Rao PGullapalli']","The perivascular space (PVS) is important to brain waste clearance and brain metabolic homeostasis. Enlarged PVS (ePVS) becomes visible on MRI and is best appreciated on T2-weighted (T2w) images. Quantification of ePVS is however challenging because standard-of-care T1-weighted (T1w) and T2w images are often obtained as 2D acquisition, whereas accurate quantification of ePVS normally requires high-resolution volumetric 3D T1w and T2w images. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of a deep learning based super-resolution technique to improve ePVS quantification from 2D T2w images for application in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. We prospectively recruited 26 volunteers (Age: 31±12yrs, 12M/14F) where both 2D T2w and 3D T2w were acquired along with 3D T1w images to validate the ePVS quantification using super-resolution T2w images. We then applied the super-resolution method to retrospectively acquired 2D T2w images in 41 chronic TBI patients (Age: 41±16yrs, 32M/9F). ePVS volumes were automatically quantified within the whole brain white matter and major brain lobes (temporal, parietal, frontal, occipital) in all subjects. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (PSQI) was obtained on all TBI patients. Compared to the Silver Standard (3D T2w), in the validation study, the super-resolution T2w provided similar whole brain white matter ePVS volume (r=0.98, p<0.0001), and similar age-related ePVS burden increase (r = 0.80, p < 0.0001). In the patient study, TBI patients with poor sleep showed a higher age-related ePVS burden increase than those with good sleep. Sleep status is a significant interaction factor in the whole brain (p = 0.047) and the frontal lobe (p = 0.027). We demonstrate that images produced by super-resolution of 2D T2w images can be automatically analyzed to produce comparable results to that obtained by 3D T2 volumes. Reliable age-related ePVS burden across the whole brain white matter was observed in all subjects. Poor sleep, affecting the glymphatic function, may contribute to the accelerated increase of ePVS burden following TBI.",brain injury

The Blast Exposure Threshold Survey (BETS) was acquired to determine blast history. Both self-report and neurocognitive measures were acquired to assess cognition. Similarity-driven Multi-view Linear Reconstruction (SiMLR) was used for joint analysis of acquired data. Analysis of BDEVs indicated significant positive associations with a generalized blast exposure value (GBEV) derived from the BETS. SiMLR-based analyses of neuroimaging demonstrated exposure-related relationships between GBEV, PET-neuroinflammation, cortical thickness and volume loss within special operators. Affected brain networks included regions associated with memory retrieval, executive functioning as well as visual and heteromodal processing. Post-hoc assessments of cognitive measures failed to demonstrate significant associations with GBEV. This emerging evidence suggests neuroinflammation may be a key feature of the brain response to blast exposure over a career in operational personnel. The common thread of neuroinflammation observed in blast-exposed populations requires further study.",brain injury
In Vivo Electrochemical Measurement of Glucose Variation in the Brain of Early Diabetic Mice.,"['BoyuZhu', 'XinruLi', 'LihangZhu', 'MinQi', 'JiayiCao', 'LinZhou', 'BinSu']","Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by a decrease in insulin level or insulin resistance. Diabetes also has detrimental effects on the brain, which can lead to the injury of the blood-brain barrier and influence the glucose transport. In this study, we use in vivo electrochemical measurement to explore the glucose variation in the brain of early diabetic mice. The glucose level in mice brain is measured using a carbon fiber microelectrode modified with the osmium-derivatized polymer and glucose oxidase. The electrode shows an excellent electrochemical performance, antibiofouling ability, and high stability, which can work stably in the mice brain for 2 h. By monitoring the glucose level in the brain of normal and diabetic mice after injection of concentrated glucose solution into the abdominal cavity, it is found that the variation of cerebral glucose decreases by ∼2 fold for diabetic mice. It is proposed that diabetes can downregulate the activity of glucose transporter in the brain and finally inhibit the brain glucose uptake.",brain injury
Nature-based rehabilitation-experiences from patients with acquired brain injury: an explorative qualitative study.,"['Anne PernilleVibholm', 'HannePallesen', 'Jeanette ReffstrupChristensen', 'DortheVarning Poulsen']","Nature has been found to improve and promote health and prevent disease. Nature-based rehabilitation (NBR) delivered as part of neurorehabilitation is a developing approach. Yet to date the research is sparse. Following an acquired brain injury (ABI), people often experience impairments that cause limitations in activity and participation in daily life, which can impact the quality of life long-term. NBR delivered in neurorehabilitation has previously been explored from the perspective of occupational therapists and physiotherapists, however, to date patients' experiences are yet to be explored. This study aims to explore patients' experiences and perspectives of NBR delivered as part of standard neurorehabilitation.
This qualitative study had a constructivist and phenomenological design. Semi-structured focus group interviews were carried out across three healthcare settings in Denmark with 17 participants. Data was analysed using content analysis.
The analysis generated three categories: 1. Outdoor versus indoor environment, 2. The natural environment as a co-therapist, and 3. Interrelatedness.
The study provides insight into participants' experiences of NBR. They reported that interacting with the natural environment as part of neurorehabilitation enhanced activity. Moreover, being in nature increased their self-efficacy, sense of autonomy, community spirit, cooperation, and joy, and led to a feeling of peace.
Nature-based rehabilitation (NBR) delivered as part of neurorehabilitation provides an alternative to indoor rehabilitation.The natural environment offers multisensory stimulation, sensory-motor training, and opportunities for mental restoration.NBR promotes social engagement, cooperation, and feelings of being in the same boat and may increase autonomy, self-efficacy, activity, and participation.NBR can be designed and delivered in a way where the natural environment and the intervention promote individual and group rehabilitation.The benefits of NBR in neurorehabilitation for patients appear to be an underexposed topic, and the intervention may provide an opportunity for improving rehabilitation for patients with acquired brain injury.",brain injury
The Neuroimmune System and the Cerebellum.,['Donna LGruol'],"The recognition that there is an innate immune system of the brain, referred to as the neuroimmune system, that preforms many functions comparable to that of the peripheral immune system is a relatively new concept and much is yet to be learned. The main cellular components of the neuroimmune system are the glial cells of the brain, primarily microglia and astrocytes. These cell types preform many functions through secretion of signaling factors initially known as immune factors but referred to as neuroimmune factors when produced by cells of the brain. The immune functions of glial cells play critical roles in the healthy brain to maintain homeostasis that is essential for normal brain function, to establish cytoarchitecture of the brain during development, and, in pathological conditions, to minimize the detrimental effects of disease and injury and promote repair of brain structure and function. However, dysregulation of this system can occur resulting in actions that exacerbate or perpetuate the detrimental effects of disease or injury. The neuroimmune system extends throughout all brain regions, but attention to the cerebellar system has lagged that of other brain regions and information is limited on this topic. This article is meant to provide a brief introduction to the cellular and molecular components of the brain immune system, its functions, and what is known about its role in the cerebellum. The majority of this information comes from studies of animal models and pathological conditions, where upregulation of the system facilitates investigation of its actions.",brain injury
Linking biomarkers with healthy lifestyle outcomes after stroke: Supplementary results of a 12-month randomized controlled trial.,"['ChadSwank', 'EvanMcShan', 'TeodoroBottiglieri', 'SandyZurawski', 'LibradaCallender', 'MonicaBennett', 'RandiDubiel', 'SimonDriver']","Participation in a healthy lifestyle intervention such as the Diabetes Prevention Program Group Lifestyle Balance-adapted for stroke (GLB-CVA) may reduce stroke burden.

Kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside contributes to modulation of depressive-like behavior in C57BL/6J mice by activating AMPK.,"['RongWang', 'XiaolongHu', 'ShumengLiu', 'JingjinWang', 'FeiXiong', 'XiaoqiZhang', 'WencaiYe', 'HaoWang']","Kaempferol-3-O-sophoroside (PCS-1) is the main component in Crocus sativus (Saffron), a traditional herb with mood-enhancing properties. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a potential therapeutic target for depression. This study aims to explore the antidepressive-like properties of PCS-1 and its AMPK activation to confirm AMPK as a target for antidepression.
Corticosterone (CORT)-induced PC12 cell injury served as an in-vitro model to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of PCS-1. Neuro-2a cells and primary neurons were utilized to evaluate the synaptogenesis role of PCS-1. CORT-induced mouse depression model and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model were used to assess the antidepressive-like properties of PCS-1 through behavioral tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and biochemical index measurements. Western blot and immunofluorescence assays were used to study the mechanisms of PCS-1. Cellular thermal shift assay was used to confirm the binding target.
PCS-1 (12.5-50 μM) ameliorated CORT-induced PC12 cell damage, oxidative stress and inflammation. PCS-1 (12.5-50 μM) alone promoted an increase in synapses in Neuro-2a cells and primary neurons. Oral administration of PCS-1 (10 and 20 mg/kg) ameliorated weight loss, dyskinesia, and hippocampal volume reduction induced by CORT and CUMS. Mechanistically, PCS-1 bound to AMPK to improve the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and induce autophagy.
PCS-1 binds to AMPK to promote BDNF production and autophagy enhancement, ultimately achieving antidepressant effects. This study provides support for the clinical application of saffron petals and provides further evidence for AMPK as a potential target for antidepression.",brain injury
Development of a therapeutic monoclonal antibody against circulating adipocyte fatty acid binding protein to treat ischemic stroke.,"['BoyaLiao', 'ShilunYang', 'LeiluoGeng', 'JiuyuZong', 'ZixuanZhang', 'MengxueJiang', 'XueJiang', 'SimengLi', 'AiminXu', 'JunleiChang', 'Ruby Lai ChongHoo']","Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (A-FABP) exacerbates cerebral ischemia injury by disrupting the blood-brain barrier (BBB) through inducing MMP-9 expression. Circulating A-FABP positively correlates with the infarct size of stroke patients. We hypothesize that targeting circulating A-FABP by a neutralizing antibody alleviates ischemic stroke outcome.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against A-FABP were generated using mouse hybridoma technique. Binding affinities of a generated mAb named 6H2 towards various FABPs were determined using Biacore. Molecular docking studies were performed to characterize the 6H2-A-FABP complex structure and epitope. The therapeutic potential and safety of 6H2 were evaluated in mice with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and healthy mice, respectively.
Replenishment of recombinant A-FABP exaggerated the stroke outcome in A-FABP-deficient mice. 6H2 exhibited nanomolar to picomolar affinities to human and mouse A-FABP, respectively, with minimal cross-reactivities with heart and epidermal FABPs. 6H2 effectively neutralized A-FABP-elicited JNK/c-Jun activation and reduced MMP-9 production in macrophages. Molecular docking suggested that 6H2 interacts with the ""lid"" of the fatty acid binding pocket of A-FABP, thus likely hindering the binding of its substrates. In mice with transient MCAO, 6H2 significantly attenuated BBB disruption, cerebral edema, infarction, neurological deficits, and decreased mortality associating with reduced cytokines and MMP-9 production. Chronic 6H2 treatment showed no obvious adverse effects in healthy mice.
These results establish the circulating A-FABP as a viable therapeutic target for ischemic stroke, and provide a highly promising antibody drug candidate with superb affinity and specificity.",brain injury
Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Autoimmunity After Aseptic Meningitis: A Report of 2 Cases.,"['Christian GBien', 'ThomasBüttner', 'Ina CReichen', 'AnnetteThomas', 'BenjaminVlad', 'FriedrichWoermann', 'Corinna IBien', 'IlijasJelcic']","We describe 2 patients with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) autoimmunity secondary to aseptic viral meningitis or meningoencephalomyelitis.
This study involved a retrospective chart review.
Two female patients, 45 and 55 years of age, developed aseptic meningoencephalomyelitis or meningitis; in one patient, it was likely caused by herpes simplex virus 2. The patients were recovering from the infectious condition when they, 51 and 5 days after onset, had new symptoms with detection of GFAP antibodies in the CSF; CSF and serum samples from the initial lumbar punctures had been negative for GFAP antibodies. Both patients recovered with steroid treatment (in one case, plus rituximab; in the other, plus azathioprine) including resolution of MRI and CSF abnormalities.
These 2 patients had GFAP autoimmunity secondary to viral meningoencephalomyelitis or meningitis. This suggests that GFAP astrocytopathy might not always be a primary disease entity; it may follow another brain injury that triggers this autoimmune response.",brain injury
Effects of neuromuscular and proprioceptive training on self-reported wellness and health scores and knee sensorimotor characteristics in active seniors.,"['TakashiNagai', 'Nathaniel ABates', 'LucaRigamonti', 'John HHollman', 'Edward RLaskowski', 'Nathan DSchilaty']","Athletes regularly engage in comprehensive neuromuscular and proprioceptive training (NPT) to prevent musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries. NPT exercises such as movement technique, agility, balance, and posture as well as yoga-based stretching and slow/deep breathing have shown added benefits in psychological and other well-being. This study aimed to examine the effects of NPT on knee sensorimotor characteristics and multi-domain wellness and health scores in active seniors.
Twenty seniors participated in the NPT intervention (15-20min session twice a week for 10 weeks) while the control group did not receive any intervention. All participants completed surveys (general health, frailty, anxiety, stress, mindfulness, optimism, and sleep quality) and laboratory testing before and after intervention. Laboratory testing included frailty tests (grip strength, 4-m walk speed, and calcaneal ultrasound-based bone density) and knee sensorimotor characteristics (peak force, visual-motor reaction time, and force steadiness).
There was significant increase in general mental health (Short Form 36 Mental Health; p = 0.005) and decrease in stress (Perceived Stress Scale; p = 0.010) and sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; p = 0.019) post-intervention while no significant changes were observed in the control group (p = 0.310-0.654). Peak knee forces in all directions and some visual-motor reaction time and force steadiness were significantly improved post-intervention only in the experimental group (p = 0.001-0.038).
A simple, yet, comprehensive NPT has potential to improve MSK health as well as various domains of well-being among active seniors.",brain injury

Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder in Athletes.,"['CollinLeibold', 'Racheal MSmetana', 'Siobhán MStatuta']","ADHD is common among the general population and may be slightly more common among athletes. Diagnosis requires six or more DSM-5-TR symptoms to have been present prior to age 12 and to have an effect on functioning in multiple settings. Different sporting organizations have varying requirements for documentation when making a diagnosis. Stimulant medications are the mainstay of treatment; psychosocial interventions, exercise, and non-stimulant medications can serve as adjuncts. Future directions in research on ADHD in sports include determining whether ADHD is overrepresented among the population of elite athletes and parsing out the relationship between ADHD and concussion risk and recovery.",brain injury
Mental Health in the Youth Athlete.,"['Mary MDaley', 'Claudia LReardon']","Though research is inconclusive in being able to determine if young athletes are more or less likely to suffer from mental health disorders compared with their non-athlete peers, there are important psychological considerations that are unique to the athletic population.

Optimization of mental health care in youth athletes requires continued efforts to improve mental health literacy, decrease stigma, encourage help-seeking behaviors, and advance the routine implementation of effective screening practices.",brain injury
Cerebral small vessel disease modifies outcomes after minimally invasive surgery for intracerebral haemorrhage.,"['YunkeLi', 'Sung-MinCho', 'RadhikaAvadhani', 'HassanAli', 'YiHao', 'Santosh BMurthy', 'Joshua NGoldstein', 'FanXia', 'XinHu', 'Natalie LUllman', 'IssamAwad', 'DanielHanley', 'Wendy CZiai']","Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) is controversial but may be beneficial if end-of-treatment (EOT) haematoma volume is reduced to ≤15 mL. We explored whether MRI findings of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) modify the effect of MIS on long-term outcomes.
Prespecified blinded subgroup analysis of 288 subjects with qualified imaging sequences from the phase 3 Minimally Invasive Surgery Plus Alteplase for Intracerebral Haemorrhage Evacuation (MISTIE) trial. We tested for heterogeneity in the effects of MIS and MIS+EOT volume ≤15 mL on the trial's primary outcome of good versus poor function at 1 year by the presence of single CSVD features and CSVD scores using multivariable models.
Of 499 patients enrolled in MISTIE III, 288 patients had MRI, 149 (51.7%) randomised to MIS and 139 (48.3%) to standard medical care (SMC). Median (IQR) ICH volume was 42 (30-53) mL. In the full MRI cohort, there was no statistically significant heterogeneity in the effects of MIS versus SMC on 1-year outcomes by any specific CSVD feature or by CSVD scores (all P

Inhibition of S100A9 alleviates neurogenic pulmonary edema after subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"['GuijunWang', 'GuoHou', 'QiTian', 'ChengliLiu', 'YujiaGuo', 'HengWei', 'ZhanZhang', 'MingchangLi']","Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) frequently arises as a complication subsequent to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Heterodimers of S100A8 and S100A9 are commonly formed, thereby initiating an inflammatory reaction through receptor binding on the cell surface. Paquinimod serves as a specific inhibitor of S100A9. The objective of this investigation is to assess the impact of Paquinimod administration and S100A9 knockout on NPE following SAH.
In this study, SAH models of C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) and S100A9 knockout mice were established through intravascular perforation. These models were then divided into several groups, including the WT-sham group, S100A9-KO-sham group, WT-SAH group, WT-SAH + Paquinimod group, and S100A9-KO-SAH group. After 24 h of SAH induction, pulmonary edema was assessed using the lung wet-dry weight method and Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Additionally, the expression levels of various proteins, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), occludin, claudin-3, Bax, Bcl-2, TLR4, MYD88, and pNF-κB, in lung tissue were analyzed using western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Lung tissue apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining.
Firstly, our findings indicate that the knockout of S100A9 has a protective effect on early brain injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Additionally, the reduction of brain injury after SAH can also alleviate neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE). Immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis revealed that compared to SAH mice with wild-type S100A9 expression (WT-SAH), the lungs of S100A9 knockout SAH mice (S100A9-KO-SAH) and mice treated with Paquinimod exhibited decreased levels of inflammatory molecules (IL-1β and TNF-α) and increased levels of tight junction proteins. Furthermore, the knockout of S100A9 resulted in upregulated expression of the apoptotic-associated protein Bax and down-regulated expression of Bcl-2. Furthermore, a decrease in TLR4, MYD88, and phosphorylated pNF-κB was noted in S100A9-KO-SAH and Paquinimod treated mice, indicating the potential involvement of the TLR4/MYD88/NF-κB signaling pathway in the inhibition of the protective effect of S100A9 on NPE following SAH.
The knockout of S100A9 not only ameliorated initial cerebral injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but also mitigated SAH-associated neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE). Additionally, Paquinimod was found to diminish NPE. These findings imply a correlation between the central nervous system and peripheral organs, highlighting the potential of safeguarding the brain to mitigate harm to peripheral organs.",brain injury
Neuronal pyroptosis mediated by STAT3 in early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"['ShengjieTang', 'NianshengLai', 'LiangXu']","Neuroinflammation induced by early brain injury (EBI) seriously affects the prognosis of patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Pyroptosis can aggravate inflammatory injury by promoting the secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Meanwhile, STAT3 plays a critical role in the inflammatory response of EBI after SAH. However, whether it plays a pyroptotic role in SAH is mainly unknown. This study aimed to explore the mechanism of STAT3 in pyroptosis in EBI after SAH. C57BL/6J mice were used to establish the SAH model. Brain tissues were collected at different time points for q-RT-PCR and western blot to detect the expression level of STAT3. After intracerebroventricular injection of STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201, they were divided into sham, SAH, SAH + Vehicle, and SAH + S3I-201. Then, the SAH grade, cerebral edema content, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, and neurological scores of mice in each group were detected. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to detect related genes and proteins, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect the expression levels of IL-18 and IL-1β. Immunofluorescence staining was used to observe the expression level of proteins. At the same time, S3I-201 was added to the primary neuron cells of the culture medium containing OxyHb to simulate the in vitro experiment, and the relevant indicators consistent with the in vivo experiment were detected. The expression of STAT3 was upregulated after SAH. Inhibition of STAT3 with S3I-201 attenuated neurological deficits, cerebral edema, and BBB damage after SAH. In addition, S3I-201 can also reduce the expression of pyroptosis-related inflammasomes such as GSDMD, NLRP3, Caspase 1, and AIM2 after SAH and the neurological damage caused by IL-18 and IL-1β. Further studies have shown that STAT3 regulates pyroptosis by promoting the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Our finding demonstrated that STAT3 regulates neuronal pyroptosis in EBI after SAH. Inhibition of STAT3 may be a potential target to attenuate the damage that triggers neuroinflammation after SAH.",brain injury
Mild traumatic brain injury induces pericyte detachment independent of stroke vulnerability.,"['BaileyWhitehead', 'DeborahCorbin', 'AliAlbowaidey', 'NingZhang', 'KateKarelina', 'Zachary MWeil']","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is an independent risk factor for ischemic stroke and can result in poorer outcomes- an effect presumed to involve the cerebral vasculature. Here we tested the hypothesis that mTBI-induced pericyte detachment from the cerebrovascular endothelium is responsible for worsened stroke outcomes. We performed a mild closed-head injury and/or treated C57/bl6 mice with imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that induces pericyte detachment. The time course of pericyte detachment was assessed 7, 14, and 28 days post injury (DPI). To test the role of pericytes in TBI-induced exacerbation of ischemic stroke outcomes, we induced mTBI and/or treated mice with imatinib for one week prior to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. We found that injury promoted pericyte detachment from the vasculature commensurate with the levels of detachment seen in imatinib-only treated animals, and that the detachment persisted for at least 14DPI, but recovered to sham levels by 28DPI. Further, mTBI, but not imatinib-induced pericyte detachment, increased infarct volume. Thus, we conclude that the transient detachment of pericytes caused by mTBI may not be sufficient to exacerbate subsequent ischemic stroke damage. These data have important implications for understanding cerebrovascular dysfunction following mTBI and potential mechanisms of increased risk for future ischemic strokes.",brain injury
Downregulation of Nrp1 transcription promotes blood-brain barrier disruption following experimental cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.,"['XiangXu', 'GangChen', 'HaiZhou', 'YangyangLiu', 'HaojieDing', 'ZongqiWang', 'HaitaoShen', 'XiangLi', 'HaiyingLi']","Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) following cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CIRI) is a major factor in the pathophysiology of stroke. Endothelial cell-cell communication is essential for maintaining BBB integrity. By analyzing GSE227651 data, we found that a decrease in endothelial cell-cell communication mediated by Sema3/Nrp1 may be due to the downregulation of Nrp1 transcription, which could contribute to BBB breakdown after CIRI. We confirmed this hypothesis by using western blot analysis to show a reduction in Nrp1 protein levels in penumbra endothelial cells after CIRI in mice. We then overexpressed Nrp1 specifically in brain endothelial cells using adeno-associated virus in mice. Furthermore, Nrp1 overexpression had a protective effect on BBB integrity, as evidenced by a decrease in IgG and albumin leakage caused by CIRI in mice. Finally, we found that Nrp1 overexpression also reduced brain cell death and neurological deficits induced by cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in mice. Our findings suggest that Nrp1 downregulation may be a key factor in the breakdown of endothelial cell-cell communication and subsequent BBB disruption following CIRI. Targeting Nrp1-mediated pathways may be a promising approach for mitigating BBB damage and alleviating neurological consequences in stroke patients.",brain injury
NTS-105 decreased cell death and preserved long-term potentiation in an in vitro model of moderate traumatic brain injury.,"['Mary Kate RDwyer', 'NicolasAmelinez-Robles', 'IsabellaPolsfuss', 'KeondreHerbert', 'CarolynKim', 'NevinVarghese', 'Tom JParry', 'BenjaminBuller', 'Todd AVerdoorn', 'Clare BBilling', 'BarclayMorrison']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of hospitalization and death. To mitigate these human costs, the search for effective drugs to treat TBI continues. In the current study, we evaluated the efficacy of the novel neurosteroid, NTS-105, to reduce post-traumatic pathobiology in an in vitro model of moderate TBI that utilizes an organotypic hippocampal slice culture. NTS-105 inhibited activation of the androgen receptor and the mineralocorticoid receptor, partially activated the progesterone B receptor and was not active at the glucocorticoid receptor. Treatment with NTS-105 starting one hour after injury decreased post-traumatic cell death in a dose-dependent manner, with 10 nM NTS-105 being most effective. Post-traumatic administration of 10 nM NTS-105 also prevented deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) without adversely affecting neuronal activity in naïve cultures. We propose that the high potency pleiotropic action of NTS-105 beneficial effects at multiple receptors (e.g. androgen, mineralocorticoid and progesterone) provides significant mechanistic advantages over native neurosteroids such as progesterone, which lacked clinical success for the treatment of TBI. Our results suggest that this pleiotropic pharmacology may be a promising strategy for the effective treatment of TBI, and future studies should test its efficacy in pre-clinical animal models of TBI.",brain injury
Role of calpain-5 in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury.,"['YusakuChukai', 'GingaIto', 'YasuoMiki', 'KoichiWakabayashi', 'KenItoh', 'ErikoSugano', 'HiroshiTomita', 'TomokazuFukuda', 'TakuOzaki']","Ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury exacerbate the prognosis of ischemic diseases. The cause of this exacerbation is partly a mitochondrial cell death pathway. Mitochondrial calpain-5 is proteolyzed/autolyzed under endoplasmic reticulum stress, resulting in inflammatory caspase-4 activation. However, the role of calpain-5 in I/R injury remains unclear. We hypothesized that calpain-5 is involved in ischemic brain disease.
Mitochondria from C57BL/6J mice were extracted via centrifugation with/without proteinase K treatment. The expression and proteolysis/autolysis of calpain-5 were determined using western blotting. The mouse and human brains with I/R injury were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. HT22 cells were treated with tunicamycin and CAPN5 siRNA.
Calpain-5 was expressed in the mitochondria of mouse tissues. Mitochondrial calpain-5 in mouse brains was responsive to calcium earlier than cytosolic calpain-5 in vitro calcium assays and in vivo bilateral common carotid artery occlusion model mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that neurons were positive for calpain-5 in the normal brains of mice and humans. The expression of calpain-5 was increased in reactive astrocytes at human infarction sites. The knockdown of calpain-5 suppressed of cleaved caspase-11.
The neurons of human and mouse brains express calpain-5, which is proteolyzed/autolyzed in the mitochondria in the early stage of I/R injury and upregulated in reactive astrocytes in the end-stage.
Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying I/R injury. Targeting the expression or activity of mitochondrial calpain-5 may suppress the inflammation during I/R injuries such as cerebrovascular diseases.",brain injury
Do academic accommodations help students recover following sport-related concussion? A retrospective study of 96 youth athletes.,"['Grant HRigney', 'JacobJo', 'CarterBurns', 'Kristen LWilliams', 'Douglas PTerry', 'Scott LZuckerman']","Many schools utilize academic accommodations to help athletes return-to-learn after sport-related concussion, yet little is known about the impact of accommodations on recovery. In a cohort of adolescent athletes with sport-related concussion, the authors sought to 1) describe academic accommodations, 2) determine predictors of receiving accommodations, and 3) determine how accommodations influenced recovery, as defined by days to return-to-learn, symptom resolution, and return-to-play.
A retrospective survey study was undertaken that included all athletes between the ages of 12 and 24 years who were seen at a regional sport-related concussion center from April 1, 2020, to April 1, 2022. Demographic characteristics, past medical history, injury characteristics, school-related factors, and recovery were collected via a telephone-based survey and from medical charts. The independent variable was the use of academic accommodations by students. The outcome variables included days to return-to-learn, symptom resolution, and return-to-play. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed.
Of 300 athletes contacted, 96 consented to participate in this study (mean age ± SD 16.6 ± 2.6 years, 60.4% male). The mean return-to-learn was 9.0 ± 13.2 days. In total, 63.5% of athletes received some kind of school accommodation. The most common accommodations included extra time on tests (46/96 [47.9%] athletes) and extra time for assignments (43/96 [44.8%]), whereas preferential seating in class (0/96 [0.0%]) and reduced workloads (4/96 [4.2%]) were the least commonly used accommodations. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that White race (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.02-0.71, p = 0.03) and higher initial Post-Concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS) score (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p = 0.02) were predictive of receiving accommodations. Univariable models showed that receiving accommodations was not predictive of return-to-learn (β = 4.67, 95% CI -0.92 to 10.25, p = 0.10), symptom resolution (β = 24.71, 95% CI -17.41 to 66.83, p = 0.26), or return-to-play (β = 13.35, 95% CI -14.56 to 41.27, p = 0.35). Regarding other predictors of each outcome, several factors emerged irrespective of accommodations. Multivariable analysis revealed that longer time to return-to-learn was associated with a history of psychiatric illness (β = 8.00, 95% CI 1.71-14.29, p = 0.02) and initial PCSS score (β = 0.14, 95% CI 0.06-0.23, p < 0.01). Finally, predictors of days to return-to-play included school personnel who were knowledgeable of concussion (β = -5.07, 95% CI -9.93 to -0.21, p = 0.04) and higher initial PCSS score (β = 0.67, 95% CI 0.04-1.29, p = 0.03).
The most common accommodation was extra time on tests/assignments, whereas reduced workload was the least common. White race and greater initial PCSS score were associated with receiving accommodations.

The Impact of an Early Out-of-Bed Paradigm in Postoperative Outcomes of Chronic Subdural Hematomas: GET-UP Randomized Prospective Trial (GET-UP Trial) is a randomized clinical trial comparing a postoperative early mobilization protocol to bed rest. Previously reported results at clinical discharge and 1 month after surgery indicated a decreased risk of medical complications in the early mobilization group. Herein, the authors report outcomes at the 1-year follow-up.
The GET-UP Trial is a prospective, randomized, unicentric, open-label study with an intention-to-treat primary analysis designed to evaluate the impact of an early mobilization protocol after burr hole craniostomy for cSDH on the occurrence of medical complications and functional outcomes. Between January 2019 and August 2021, a total of 208 patients were recruited and randomized to either an early mobilization group, in which patients began elevation of the head of the bed within the first 12 hours after surgery, or to a bed rest group, in which patients remained recumbent for 48 hours. Outcomes assessed at the 1-year follow-up included functional status as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) and repeat surgery for hematoma recurrence (surgical recurrence).
A total of 203 patients completed 1 year of follow-up: 101 in the bed rest group and 102 in the early mobilization group. No significant baseline pre-randomization clinical differences were observed between the two management groups. At 1 year after surgery, a favorable functional outcome, defined as a GOSE score ≥ 5, was observed in 59 patients (58.4%) in the bed rest group and 78 (76.5%) in the early mobilization group (p = 0.006). Death occurred in 25 patients (24.8%) in the bed rest group and 16 (15.7%) in the early mobilization group (p = 0.108). Surgical recurrence was noted in 6 patients (5.9%) in the bed rest group and 7 (6.9%) in the early mobilization group (p = 0.788). Multivariate analysis showed an independent association between early mobilization and an increase in favorable functional outcomes (OR 2.006, 95% CI 1.076-3.739, p = 0.028).
The GET-UP Trial is the first randomized clinical trial assessing the impact of mobilization strategies on medical complications after burr hole craniostomy for cSDH. Regarding functional results 1 year after surgery, early mobilization was associated with an improvement in functional outcomes without an increase in surgical recurrence. These findings support the preference for an early mobilization protocol in cSDH patients over mandatory bed rest strategies.",brain injury
Restoring neuronal iron homeostasis revitalizes neurogenesis after spinal cord injury.,"['HuiminGeng', 'ZhiweiLi', 'ZhengLi', 'YuqiZhang', 'ZhiliangGao', 'LeiSun', 'XingangLi', 'JiweiCui', 'ShileiNi', 'JingchengHao']","Spinal cord injury (SCI) can lead to iron overloading and subsequent neuronal ferroptosis, which hinders the recovery of locomotor function. However, it is still unclear whether the maintenance of neuronal iron homeostasis enables to revitalize intrinsic neurogenesis. Herein, we report the regulation of cellular iron homeostasis after SCI via the chelation of excess iron ions and modulation of the iron transportation pathway using polyphenol-based hydrogels for the revitalization of intrinsic neurogenesis. The reversed iron overloading can promote neural stem/progenitor cell differentiation into neurons and elicit the regenerative potential of newborn neurons, which is accompanied by improved axon reinnervation and remyelination. Notably, polyphenol-based hydrogels significantly increase the neurological motor scores from ~8 to 18 (out of 21) and restore the transmission of sensory and motor electrophysiological signals after SCI. Maintenance of iron homeostasis at the site of SCI using polyphenol-based hydrogels provides a promising paradigm to revitalize neurogenesis for the treatment of iron accumulation-related nervous system diseases.",brain injury
"Plasma Reference Ranges for Brain Injury Biomarkers (NfL, NfH, MCP-1, and MMP-9) in Healthy Chinese.","['HuiminZhu', 'XiaodongJia', 'ZhenjuanFang', 'ChengyiZhang', 'NingningWang', 'HaoxiaoChang', 'Wei-NaJin', 'Fu-DongShi', 'WenyanHe']","Brain injury triggers neuroaxonal injury and neural death, that leads to the development of secondary sequelae. Throughout this process, brain injury factors released into circulation via the injured neurovascular unit are important prognostic parameters. Plasma NfL, NfH, MCP-1, and MMP-9 have been identified as potential indicators in this regard.
Using a microfluidic ELISA platform, we measured plasma from 273 healthy subjects that underwent quantifications of NfL, NfH, MCP-1, and MMP-9 levels. We investigated the possible associations between biomarkers and basic demographics.
The median concentration of plasma NfL was 10.40 (IQR = 6.73 - 16.60) pg/mL, NfH was 70.70 (IQR = 39.75 - 125.50) pg/mL, MCP-1 was 191.0 (IQR = 162.0 - 237.5) pg/mL, and MMP-9 was 169,255 (IQR = 107,657 - 231,276) pg/mL. Among all four biomarkers, plasma NfL and NfH levels were positively correlated with age (r = 0.557, p < 0.001, r = 0.364, p = 0.003). NfL was also correlated with NfH (r = 0.391, p = 0.002).
These data provide a basis for the potential application of a brain-injury biomarker panel in routine clinical practice. It lays a significant foundation in supporting circulating CNS-biomarkers as noninvasive biomarkers for neurological disorders.",brain injury
Social workers and acquired brain injury: A systematic review of the current evidence-base.,"['Mark ALinden', 'MarkHolloway', 'ClaireCooper', 'AkudoAmadiegwu', 'CarolineBald', 'MichaelClark', 'AndyMantell', 'AlysonNorman', 'AndrewBateman']","Social work plays an important role in the assessment and treatment of people with acquired brain injury. Acquired brain injury is a complex and highly prevalent condition which can impact on cognitive, emotional and social domains. As acquired brain injury is a hidden disability it can be misdiagnosed or classified as another condition entirely. We sought to systematically explore the evidence base to examine how social workers have been prepared to work with their clients with brain injury. Employing six electronic databases (Social Policy & Practice, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL Plus) we reviewed 1071 papers. After applying eligibility criteria 17 papers were included in this review. We utilised standardised data extraction and quality appraisal tools to assess all included papers. Following appraisal, 9 papers were judged as possessing high methodological quality whilst 8 were judged as medium. Employing narrative synthesis, we identified four themes which captured the key findings of these papers. Themes were named as (i) advocacy and social work (ii) training and multidisciplinary team working (iii) inclusion of social networks and (iv) societal barriers. In order to meet their statutory responsibilities to practice safely, social workers must receive training in how to identify ABI and develop understanding of its consequences and subsequent need for provision. Social workers are also in a unique position to advocate for their clients and should make every effort to ensure their needs are met.",brain injury
Unequal Cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging Changes in Perinatal Hypoxic Ischemic Injury of Term Neonates.,"['Shyam Sunder BVenkatakrishna', 'MohamedElsingergy', 'FikaduWorede', 'JelenaCuric', 'SavvasAndronikou']","Perinatal hypoxic ischemic injury (HII) has a higher prevalence in the developing world. One of the primary concepts for suggesting that an imaging pattern reflects a global insult to the brain is when the injury is noted to be bilateral and symmetric in distribution. In the context of HII in term neonates, this is either bilateral symmetric ( a ) peripheral/watershed (WS) injury or ( b ) bilateral symmetric basal-ganglia-thalamus (BGT) pattern, often with the peri-Rolandic and hippocampal injury. Unilateral, asymmetric, or unequal distribution of injury may therefore be misdiagnosed as perinatal arterial ischemic stroke.
We aimed to determine the prevalence of unequal cerebral injury in HII, identify patterns, and determine their relationship with existing classification of HII.
Review of brain magnetic resonance imaging from a database of children with HII. Reports with any unequal pattern of injury were included and further classified as a unilateral, bilateral asymmetric, or symmetric but unequal degree pattern of HII.
A total of 1213 MRI scans in patients with a diagnosis of HII revealed 156 (13%) with unequal involvement of the hemispheres: unilateral in 2 of 1213 (0.2%) (involvement only in the WS), asymmetric in 48 of 1213 (4%) (WS in 6 [0.5%], BGT in 4 [0.3%], and combined BGT and WS in 38 [3.1%]), and bilateral symmetric but unequal degree in 106 of 1213 (8.7%) (WS in 20 [1.6%], BGT in 17 [1.4%], and combined BGT and WS in 69 [5.7%]).
The majority of children with cerebral palsy due to HII demonstrate a characteristic bilateral symmetric pattern of injury. In our study, 13% demonstrated an unequal pattern. Differentiation from perinatal arterial ischemic stroke, which is mostly unilateral and distributed typically in the middle cerebral artery territory, should be possible and recognition of the typical BGT or WS magnetic resonance imaging patterns should add confidence to the diagnosis, in such scenarios.",brain injury
Measurement of Head Kinematics Using Instrumented Mouthguards During Introductory Boxing Courses in U.S. Military Academy Cadets.,"['Travis JFetchko', 'Gerald JHart', 'Michael JAderman', 'Jeremy DRoss', 'Steven RMalvasi', 'Megan HRoach', 'Kenneth LCameron', 'Tyler FRooks']","Use of wearable impact sensor devices to quantitatively measure head impact exposure remains largely unstudied in military-style martial arts training and combat sports, particularly at the beginner levels. The baseline frequency and severity of head impact exposure during introductory military-style martial arts trainings, such as combatives training, is valuable information for developing future programs of instruction and exposure monitoring programs. The purpose of this study was to describe head impact exposures experienced during introductory combatives training (a boxing course) at U.S. Military Academy.
This study used instrumented mouthguards to measure head impact exposure in U.S. Military Academy cadets during a compulsory boxing course. Summary exposures from a preliminary dataset are presented.
Twenty-two male subjects (19.9 ± 1.1 years, 86.6 ± 11.7 kg) participated in 205 analyzed player-bouts (full contact sparring sessions) with 809 video verified impacts (average 3.9 impacts per player-bout). The mean peak linear acceleration was 16.5 ±7.1 G, with a maximum of 70.8 G. There was a right-skewed distribution, with 640/809 (79.1%) events falling between 10 and 20 G. The mean peak angular acceleration was 1.52 ± 0.96 krad/s2, with a maximum of 8.85 krad/s2.
Compared to other high-risk sports at Service Academies, head impacts from beginner boxing were of similar magnitude to those reported for Service Academy football and slightly lower than those reported for Service Academy rugby. Based on these preliminary data, the risk profile for introductory military-style martial arts training, such as boxing or combatives, may be similar to other contact sports like football and rugby, but further research is required to confirm these findings and understand the effects of the exposures in a shorter duration.",brain injury
A Common Data Element-Based Adjudication Process for mTBI Clinical Profiles: A Targeted Multidomain Clinical Trial Preliminary Study.,"['Kori JDurfee', 'R JElbin', 'Alicia MTrbovich', 'Melissa NWomble', 'AnneMucha', 'KatieStephenson', 'Cyndi LHolland', 'Christina MDollar', 'Patrick JSparto', 'Michael WCollins', 'Anthony PKontos']","The primary purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence and percent agreement of clinician-identified mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) clinical profiles and cutoff scores for selected Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research common data elements (CDEs). A secondary purpose was to investigate the predictive value of established CDE assessments in determining clinical profiles in adults with mTBI.
Seventy-one (23 males; 48 females) participants (M = 29.00, SD = 7.60, range 18-48 years) within 1-5 months (M = 24.20, SD = 25.30, range 8-154 days) of mTBI completed a clinical interview/exam and a multidomain assessment conducted by a licensed clinician with specialized training in concussion, and this information was used to identify mTBI clinical profile(s). A researcher administered CDE assessments to all participants, and scores exceeding CDE cutoffs were used to identify an mTBI clinical profile. The clinician- and CDE-identified clinical profiles were submitted to a multidisciplinary team for adjudication. The prevalence and percent agreement between clinician- and CDE-identified clinical profiles was documented, and a series of logistic regressions with adjusted odds ratios were performed to identify which CDE assessments best predicted clinician-identified mTBI clinical profiles.
Migraine/headache, vestibular, and anxiety/mood mTBI clinical profiles exhibited the highest prevalence and overall percent agreement among CDE and clinician approaches. Participants exceeding cutoff scores for the Global Severity Index and Headache Impact Test-6 assessments were 3.90 and 8.81 times more likely to have anxiety/mood and migraine/headache profiles, respectively. The Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening vestibular items and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index total score were predictive of clinician-identified vestibular and sleep profiles, respectively.
The CDEs from migraine/headache, vestibular, and anxiety/mood domains, and to a lesser extent the sleep modifier, may be clinically useful for identifying patients with these profiles following mTBI. However, CDEs for cognitive and ocular may have more limited clinical value for identifying mTBI profiles.",brain injury
Provider Perceptions of Oxygenation Strategies for Critically Ill Trauma Patients With and Without Moderate-to-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury.,"['LayneDylla', 'David JDouin', 'Jessica ECwik', 'AimeeSteinwand', 'John DRice', 'Conner LJackson', 'Erin LAnderson', 'Hannah MHiggins', 'Andrew AMonte', 'Adit AGinde']","Hypoxia and hyperoxia (pulse oximetry [SpO2] > 96%) are associated with increased mortality in critically ill patients. However, provider practices regarding oxygenation in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients are unknown. This study assesses views on oxygenation of critically ill trauma patients with and without TBI and how this varies between Neurological ICU (NeuroICU) and Surgical-Trauma ICU (STICU) providers.
This is a cross-sectional survey of Level I trauma center's NeuroICU and STICU providers. We used Likert scales, yes-no questions, and multiple-choice case-based scenarios to characterize provider views on oxygenation with descriptive statistics to characterize responses. Significant differences regarding TBI and non-TBI patients or NeuroICU and STICU providers were determined using Fisher's exact test and a P-value of .05.
A total of 83 providers initiated the survey, and 53 providers completed it. Most providers identified a threshold SpO2 < 92% for the administration of supplemental oxygen in critically ill TBI patients. A total of 9% of providers ""somewhat or completely agreed"" that they were more likely to give supplemental oxygen to a critically ill trauma patient with TBI than one without TBI and the same SpO2. A total of 48% of providers selected an SpO2 < 90% as the point at which supplemental oxygen should be initiated in patients without TBI, compared to 27% of providers in patients with TBI (P < .01). This threshold for supplemental oxygen use varied by provider type for non-TBI patients, but not for TBI patients (30% NeuroICU and 69% STICU providers selected SpO2 < 90% in non-TBI, P < .05; 30% NeuroICU and 35% STICU providers selected SpO2 < 90% in TBI, P = .85).
Critical care providers at UCHealth University of Colorado Hospital approach the oxygenation of critically ill trauma patients with and without TBI differently. Specifically, critical care respondents accepted a different lower oxygen saturation threshold for TBI and non-TBI patients. NeuroICU and STICU respondents differed in their threshold for the down-titration of supplemental oxygen. Targeted education for critical care providers may reduce these discrepancies and optimize oxygen use.",brain injury
A Novel External Ventricular Drain Sensor to Improve Acquired Brain Injury Monitoring.,"['ZackGoldblum', 'VictoriaGruen', 'DaiWai MOlson', 'GiovanniKanter', 'DickMoberg']","The insufficiency of current methods to capture the context and environment of neurocritical care can negatively impact patient outcomes. Insertion of an external ventricular drain (EVD) into the ventricles to monitor intracranial pressure (ICP) is a common lifesaving procedure for acquired brain injury patients. Yet, nursing interventions that significantly affect the measured ICP value, such as changing the EVD stopcock position, are poorly documented. Environmental factors like light and noise levels are not monitored as standard of care despite worse outcomes in patients affiliated with sensory sensitivities. Capturing these missing data is an essential first step toward quantifying their effects.
Our entry point was the development of a stopcock position sensor (SPS) that attaches to the EVD stopcock and time-synchronously annotates the recorded ICP data with its position. A two-phase, prospective, nonrandomized observational study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the SPS. Phase I assessed the SPS using an ex vivo simulation of ICP management. Phase II involved human subjects with the SPS attached to the EVD stopcock while patients were managed per standard of care.
The SPS accurately annotated the ICP data and identified that the EVD drained the cerebrospinal fluid for 94.52% of total patient monitoring time (16.98 h). For only 3.54% of the time, the stopcock directed the cerebrospinal fluid into the pressure transducer for accurate ICP measurement. For the remaining 1.94% of the time, the stopcock was positioned off: No cerebrospinal fluid drainage and no ICP monitoring.
We successfully captured an important aspect of the ICP monitoring context, the EVD stopcock position, and time-synchronized it with the recorded physiology. Our system enables future investigations into the impact that a broad contextual data environment has on physiological measurements and acquired brain injury patient outcomes. In the future, we aim to capture additional contextual data sources and expand the scope to battlefield environments.",brain injury
Development of the Troop Readiness Evaluation With Augmented Reality Return-to-Duty (Troop READY) Platform to Aid in the Detection and Treatment of Military Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"['Anson BRosenfeldt', 'Ryan DKaya', 'KelseyOwen', 'KarissaHastilow', 'KathrynScelina', 'LoganScelina', 'MandyMiller Koop', 'EricZimmerman', 'Jay LAlberts']","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is prevalent in service members (SMs); however, there is a lack of consensus on the appropriate approach to return to duty (RTD). Head-mounted augmented reality technology, such as the HoloLens 2, can create immersive, salient environments to more effectively evaluate relevant military task performance. The Troop Readiness Evaluation with Augmented Reality Return-to-Duty (READY) platform was developed to objectively quantify cognitive and motor performance during military-specific activities to create a comprehensive approach to aid in mTBI detection and facilitate appropriate RTD. The aim of this project was to detail the technical development of the Troop READY platform, the outcomes, and its potential role in the aiding detection and RTD decision-making post mTBI. The secondary aim included evaluating the safety, feasibility, and SM usability of the Troop READY platform.
The Troop READY platform comprises three assessment modules of progressing complexity: (1) Static and Dynamic Mobility, (2) Rifle Qualification Test, and (3) Small Unit Operations Capacity-Room Breach/Clearing Exercise. The modules were completed by 137 active duty SMs. Safety was assessed through monitoring of adverse events. Feasibility was assessed using the self-directed module completion rate. Usability was measured using the Systems Usability Scale.
No adverse events occurred. Completion rates of the three modules ranged from 98 to 100%. In terms of usability, the mean Systems Usability Scale score of all participants was 83.92 (13.95), placing the Troop READY platform in the good-to-excellent category. Objective motor and cognitive outcomes were generated for each module.
The Troop READY platform delivers self-directed, salient assessment modules to quantify single-task, dual-task, and unit-based performance in SMs. The resultant data provide insight into SM performance through objective outcomes and identify specific areas of executive or motor function that may be slow to recover following mTBI.",brain injury
Mitigation of Hearing Damage With Liraglutide Treatment in Chinchillas After Repeated Blast Exposures at Mild-TBI.,"['ShangyuanJiang', 'SarahSanders', 'Rong ZGan']","Although hearing protection devices (HPDs) have been widely used during training and combat, over one million veterans experience service-connected hearing loss. Hearing damage has been reported to be associated with blast-induced mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and there is a lack of understanding and treatment. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and a potential treatment for TBI-induced memory deficits. This study aims to investigate the function of the liraglutide to prevent damage and facilitate hearing restoration in chinchillas exposed to multiple high-intensity, mTBI-level blasts.
Chinchillas were divided into three treatment groups: blast control, pre-blast drug treatment, and post-blast drug treatment. On day 1, the chinchilla ears were protected by HPDs and exposed to three blasts with peak pressure levels of 15-25 psi. The auditory brainstem response (ABR), distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE), and middle latency response (MLR) were recorded pre- and post-blast on day 1 and on days 4, 7, 14, and 28.
Substantial acute damage was observed and progressively recovered in chinchillas after the blast exposures. The pre-blast treatment group exhibited the lowest elevation of the ABR threshold and reduction of the wave I amplitude on day 1 after blasts. The liraglutide treatment insignificantly facilitated the recovery of the DPOAE levels and ABR thresholds on days 14 and 28. The pre-blast treatment chinchillas showed reduced MLR amplitudes on days 4 and 7.
This study indicated that the pre-blast liraglutide administration provided damage protection against blasts in addition to the HPDs. Current evidence suggests that the effect of liraglutide is more prominent in the early phase of the experiment.",brain injury
The Microsoft HoloLens 2 Provides Accurate Biomechanical Measures of Performance During Military-Relevant Activities in Healthy Adults.,"['MandyMiller Koop', 'Anson BRosenfeldt', 'KelseyOwen', 'EricZimmerman', 'JoshuaJohnston', 'Matthew CStreicher', 'AlecAlbright', 'Amanda LPenko', 'Jay LAlberts']","Augmented reality systems, like the HoloLens 2 (HL2), have the potential to provide accurate assessments of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) symptoms in military personnel by simulating complex military scenarios while objectively measuring the user's movements with embedded motion sensors. The aim of this project was to determine if biomechanical measures of marching and squatting, derived from the HL2 motion sensors, were statistically equivalent, within 5%, to metrics derived from the gold-standard three-dimensional motion capture (MoCap) system.
Sixty-four adults (18-45 years; 34 males) completed a squatting and a marching task under single- (motor) and dual-task (motor + cognitive) conditions. Positional data from the HL2 and MoCap were simultaneously collected during the tasks and used to calculate and compare biomechanical outcomes. The HL2's augmented reality capabilities were utilized to deliver the cognitive component of the marching dual task.
Equivalence testing indicated the HL2 and MoCap measures were within 5% in all squatting metrics-trial time, squat duration, squat velocity, squat depth, and dwell time. Marching metrics, including trial time, step count, stepping rate, and step interval, were also equivalent between the two systems. The mean reaction time for responses during the Stroop test was 810 (125) milliseconds per response.
Biomechanical outcomes characterizing performance during two common military movements, squatting and marching, were equivalent between the HL2 and MoCap systems in healthy adults. Squatting and marching are two military-relevant tasks that require strength, motor coordination, and balance to perform, all of which are known to be affected by mTBI. Taken together, the data provide support for using the HL2 platform to deliver military-specific assessment scenarios and accurately measure performance during these activities. Utilizing objective and quantitative measures of motor function may enhance the management of military mTBI and reduce unnecessary risk to service members.",brain injury
Regional Strain Response of an Anatomically Accurate Human Finite Element Head Model Under Frontal Versus Lateral Loading.,"['Tyler FRooks', 'Valeta CarolChancey', 'Jamie LBaisden', 'NarayanYoganandan']","Because brain regions are responsible for specific functions, regional damage may cause specific, predictable symptoms. However, the existing brain injury criteria focus on whole brain response. This study developed and validated a detailed human brain computational model with sufficient fidelity to include regional components and demonstrate its feasibility to obtain region-specific brain strains under selected loading.
Model development used the Simulated Injury Monitor (SIMon) model as a baseline. Each SIMon solid element was split into 8, with each shell element split into 4. Anatomical regions were identified from FreeSurfer fsaverage neuroimaging template. Material properties were obtained from literature. The model was validated against experimental intracranial pressure, brain-skull displacement, and brain strain data. Model simulations used data from laboratory experiments with a rigid arm pendulum striking a helmeted head-neck system. Data from impact tests (6 m/s) at 2 helmet sites (front and left) were used.
Model validation showed good agreement with intracranial pressure response, fair to good agreement with brain-skull displacement, and good agreement for brain strain. CORrelation Analysis scores were between 0.72 and 0.93 for both maximum principal strain (MPS) and shear strain. For frontal impacts, regional MPS was between 0.14 and 0.36 (average of left and right hemispheres). For lateral impacts, MPS was between 0.20 and 0.48 (left hemisphere) and between 0.22 and 0.51 (right hemisphere). For frontal impacts, regional cumulative strain damage measure (CSDM20) was between 0.01 and 0.87. For lateral impacts, CSDM20 was between 0.36 and 0.99 (left hemisphere) and between 0.09 and 0.93 (right hemisphere).
Recognizing that neural functions are related to anatomical structures and most model-based injury metrics focus on whole brain response, this study developed an anatomically accurate human brain model to capture regional responses. Model validation was comparable with current models. The model provided sufficient anatomical detail to describe brain regional responses under different impact conditions.",brain injury
Strain Response of an Anatomically Accurate Nonhuman Primate Finite Element Brain Model Under Sagittal Loading.,"['Tyler FRooks', 'Valeta CarolChancey', 'Jamie LBaisden', 'NarayanYoganandan']","Prevention and treatment of traumatic brain injuries is critical to preserving soldier brain health. Laboratory studies are commonly used to reproduce injuries, understand injury mechanisms, and develop tolerance limits; however, this approach has limitations for studying brain injury, which requires a physiological response. The nonhuman primate (NHP) has been used as an effective model for investigating brain injury for many years. Prior research using the NHP provides a valuable resource to leverage using modern analysis and modeling techniques to improve our understanding of brain injury. The objectives of the present study are to develop an anatomically accurate finite element model of the NHP and determine regional brain responses using previously collected NHP data.
The finite element model was developed using a neuroimaging-based anatomical atlas of the rhesus macaque that includes both cortical and subcortical structures. Head kinematic data from 10 sagittal NHP experiments, four +Gx (rearward) and six -Gx (frontal), were used to test model stability and obtain brain strain responses from multiple severities and vectors.
For +Gx tests, the whole-brain cumulative strain damage measure exceeding a strain threshold of 0.15 (CSDM15) ranged from 0.28 to 0.89, and 95th percentile of the whole-brain maximum principal strain (MPS95) ranged from 0.21 to 0.59. For -Gx tests, whole-brain CSDM15 ranged from 0.02 to 0.66, and whole-brain MPS95 ranged from 0.08 to 0.39.
Recognizing that NHPs are the closest surrogate to humans combined with the limitations of conducting brain injury research in the laboratory, a detailed anatomically accurate finite element model of an NHP was developed and exercised using previously collected data from the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory. The presently developed model can be used to conduct additional analyses to act as pilot data for the design of newer experiments with statistical power because of the sensitivity and resources needed to conduct experiments with NHPs.",brain injury
The Impact of Lifetime Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) on Mental Health Symptoms among Service Members in Interdisciplinary TBI Programs.,"['Rosemay ARemigio-Baker', 'Jason MBailie', 'Mark LEttenhofer', 'EvelynCordero', 'Lars DHungerford']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is highly prevalent among active duty service members (ADSMs) and imposes a significant health burden, particularly on mental health (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and depressive symptoms). Little is known about how TBI setting characteristics impact PTSD and depressive symptom expression in service members undergoing interdisciplinary TBI care.
The study included 455 patients enrolled in interdisciplinary, outpatient TBI programs within the military health system. Using Poisson regression with robust error variance, TBI injury setting characteristics (i.e., before military service, during military training, and during noncombat/combat deployment) were evaluated against clinically-elevated PTSD (PTSD Checklist, DSM-5 score ≥ 33) and depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-8 score ≥ 15) symptoms.
In adjusted models, TBI sustained before military service was associated with less likelihood for clinically-elevated PTSD symptoms at pretreatment (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.76, confidence interval [CI] = 0.60-0.96) and post-treatment (PR = 0.67, CI = 0.52-0.87). TBI sustained during combat deployment, however, resulted in the greatest impact on clinically-elevated pretreatment PTSD (PR = 1.49, CI = 1.16-1.91) and depressive (PR = 1.47, CI = 1.06-2.03) symptoms. Null results were found between military training/noncombat deployment and mental health symptoms. Regardless of the TBI setting, following TBI treatment, there remained 37.5% (n = 180) and 24.8% (n = 108) with clinically-elevated PTSD and depressive symptoms, respectively.
There was a differential impact of TBI settings, particularly between TBI sustained before military service and that from combat deployment among ADSMs enrolled in outpatient TBI programs. This may be indicative of differences in the characteristics of these environments (e.g., injury severity) or the impact of such an event during recovery from current TBIs. The large percentage of ADSMs who present with clinically-elevated mental health symptoms after treatment may suggest the need for additional resources to address mental health needs before, during, and after treatment in TBI programs.",brain injury
Prevalence and Risk Factors of Self-reported Dizziness in Post-9/11 Service Members and Veterans.,"['AnnekaSonstroem', 'SamritaThapa', 'KayleePigott', 'James AHenry', 'JamesSchultz', 'CarlosEsquivel', 'Kathleen FCarlson', 'Timothy EHullar', 'Kelly MReavis']","Dizziness is prevalent in the general population, but little is known about its prevalence in the U.S. military population. Dizziness is commonly associated with blast exposure and traumatic brain injury (TBI), but the potential independent contributions of blast and TBI have yet to be evaluated. This study's goal was to estimate the prevalence of dizziness among post-9/11 service members and Veterans and to examine independent and joint associations between military TBI history, blast exposure, and self-reported dizziness.
The study sample consisted of service members (n = 424) and recently separated (< ∼2.5 years) Veterans (n = 492) enrolled in the Noise Outcomes in Service members Epidemiology (NOISE) Study. We examined associations between self-reported history of probable TBI and blast exposure and recent dizziness using logistic regression. Models were stratified by service member versus Veteran status and adjusted to account for potentially confounding demographic and military characteristics.
Overall, 22% of service members and 31% of Veterans self-reported dizziness. Compared to those with neither TBI nor blast exposure history, both service members and Veterans with TBI (with or without blast) were three to four times more likely to self-report dizziness. Those with blast exposure but no TBI history were not more likely to self-report dizziness. There was no evidence of an interaction effect between blast exposure and a history of TBI on the occurrence of dizziness.
Self-reported dizziness was prevalent in this sample of service members and Veterans. Probable TBI history, with or without blast exposure, was associated with dizziness, but blast exposure without TBI history was not. This suggests that treatment guidelines for TBI-related dizziness may not need to be tailored to the injury mechanism. However, future efforts should be directed toward the understanding of the pathophysiology of TBI on self-reported dizziness, which is fundamental to the design of treatment strategies.",brain injury
Relation of Aerobic Activity to Cognition and Well-being in Chronic Mild Traumatic Brain Injury: A LIMBIC-CENC Study.,"['Brennan MWright', 'ChongZhang', 'Renae RFisher', 'Amol MKarmarkar', 'James MBjork', 'Mary JoPugh', 'Cooper BHodges', 'Sarah LMartindale', 'Elisabeth AWilde', 'KimbraKenney', 'Scott DMcDonald', 'Randall SScheibel', 'Mary RNewsome', 'Lawrence JCook', 'William CWalker']","Because chronic difficulties with cognition and well-being are common after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and aerobic physical activity and exercise (PAE) is a potential treatment and mitigation strategy, we sought to determine their relationship in a large sample with remote mTBI.
The Long-Term Impact of Military-Relevant Brain Injury Consortium-Chronic Effects of Neurotrauma Consortium prospective longitudinal study is a national multicenter observational study of combat-exposed service members and veterans. Study participants with positive mTBI histories (n = 1,087) were classified as ""inactive"" (23%), ""insufficiently active"" (46%), ""active"" (19%), or ""highly active"" (13%) based on the aerobic PAE level. The design was a cross-sectional analysis with multivariable regression. PAE was reported on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Preselected primary outcomes were seven well-validated cognitive performance tests of executive function, learning, and memory: The California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition Long-Delay Free Recall and Total Recall, Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised Total Recall, Trail-Making Test-Part B, and NIH Toolbox for the Assessment of Neurological Behavior and Function Cognition Battery Picture Sequence Memory, Flanker, and Dimensional Change Card Sort tests. Preselected secondary outcomes were standardized self-report questionnaires of cognitive functioning, life satisfaction, and well-being.
Across the aerobic activity groups, cognitive performance tests were not significantly different. Life satisfaction and overall health status scores were higher for those engaging in regular aerobic activity. Exploratory analyses also showed better working memory and verbal fluency with higher aerobic activity levels.
An association between the aerobic activity level and the preselected primary cognitive performance outcome was not demonstrated using this study sample and methods. However, higher aerobic activity levels were associated with better subjective well-being. This supports a clinical recommendation for regular aerobic exercise among persons with chronic or remote mTBI. Future longitudinal analyses of the exercise-cognition relationship in chronic mTBI populations are recommended.",brain injury
The Association Between Glasgow Coma Scale Scores and PTSD in Military Trauma Casualties: Does Mental Status Following Injury Play a Role in PTSD Development?,"['ShirBulis', 'TomerTalmy', 'IrinaRadomislensky', 'DanielGelman', 'ShirBushinsky', 'DiklaNachum', 'GaiaTomer', 'Avishai MTsur', 'OmerPaulman', 'SamiGendler', 'OferAlmog', 'AviBenov']","Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent among military personnel and may arise following a wide range of traumatic exposures. Consciousness level following traumatic injury may play a role in the development of PTSD, but its effects have been primarily investigated in the context of traumatic brain injury.
Registry-based study surveying three databases documenting care from point of injury to long-term rehabilitation of traumatic injuries among military personnel. The study population was divided according to Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores upon emergency department admission (GCS scores 15, 13 and 14, 9-12, and 3-8), with PTSD diagnoses being determined according to disability claim records. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to determine the association between GCS score at admission and PTSD.
Overall, 3,376 military personnel hospitalized following traumatic injuries between 1997 and 2020 were included. The majority were male (92.3%), with a median age of 20 (interquartile range 19-22) at the injury time. Of these, 569 (16.9%) were diagnosed with PTSD according to disability claims, with a median follow-up time of 10.9 years. PTSD diagnosis was most prevalent (30.3% of patients), with a GCS score of 13 and 14. In the adjusted multivariable model, a GCS score of 13 and 14 was associated with significantly higher odds of PTSD diagnosis when compared to a GCS score of 15 (odds ratio 2.19, 95% CI, 1.21-3.88). The associations of other GCS groupings with PTSD diagnosis were nonsignificant.
Minimally impaired consciousness following traumatic injuries is associated with increased odds of PTSD. The role of patient awareness, analgesia, and sedation following an injury in developing PTSD warrants further investigation and could guide early diagnosis and preventive interventions.",brain injury
Paroxysmal Sympathetic Hyperactivity After Acquired Brain Injury: An Integrative Review of Diagnostic and Management Challenges.,"['Sui-YiXu', 'QiZhang', 'Chang-XinLi']","Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH) mainly occurs after acquired brain injury (ABI) and often presents with high fever, hypertension, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, and dystonia (increased muscle tone or spasticity). The pathophysiological mechanisms of PSH are not fully understood. Currently, there are several views: (1) disconnection theory, (2) excitatory/inhibitory ratio, (3) neuroendocrine function, and (4) neutrophil extracellular traps. Early diagnosis of PSH remains difficult, given the low specificity of its diagnostic tools and unclear pathogenesis. According to updated case analyses in recent years, PSH is now more commonly observed in patients with stroke, with tachycardia and hypertension as the main clinical manifestations, which is not fully consistent with previous data. To date, the PSH Assessment Measure tool is optimal for the early identification of PSH and stratification of symptom severity. Clinical strategies for the management of PSH are divided into three main points: (1) reduction of stimulation, (2) reduction of sympathetic excitatory afferents, and (3) inhibition of the effects of sympathetic hyperactivity on target organs. However, use of drugs and standards have not yet been harmonized. Further investigation on the relationship between PSH severity and long-term neurological prognosis in patients with ABI is required. This review aimed to determine the diagnostic and management challenges encountered in PSH after ABI.",brain injury
Effect of Naoxintong Capsule on Microglia and Proteomics of Cortex After Myocardial Infarction in Rats.,"['MengliChang', 'YuxinLei', 'JingZhang', 'JingXu', 'HongweiWu', 'ShihuanTang', 'HongjunYang']","Neuroinflammation caused by microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) is observed after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the inflammatory response mechanism remains unclear. BuChang Naoxintong capsule (NXT) is a Chinese medicine for treating ischemic cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, requiring more studies to understand the pharmacodynamic mechanism. Permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was performed in rats. Additionally, histopathological staining in the left ventricular (LV) and immunofluorescence within the brain cortex after 1 d and 7 d of MI were performed to determine the NXT pharmacodynamic action and best administration dosage. Proteomics helped obtain the essential proteins related to neuroinflammation and MI in the heart and brain tissue after 7 d of MI. Based on TTC, HE, Masson, and immunofluorescence staining results of CD206 and IBA-1, NXT demonstrated a better pharmacodynamic action towards myocardial injury and neuroinflammation after 7 d of MI. Moreover, the human equivalent dosage of NXT (220 mg/kg) became the best administration dose. The proteome bioinformatics analysis in the LV and brain cortex was performed. Thus, the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 5 (ELOVL5) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 4 (ABCG4) became critical proteins related to MI and neuroinflammation. The western blotting results indicated that ABCG4 expression possessed the same trend as the proteomics results. The auto-dock results revealed that ABCG4 had a good binding ability with Ferulic acid, Paeoniflorin, and Tanshinone II A, the key ingredients of NXT. The cellular thermal shift assay results demonstrated that ABCG4 showed better thermal stability post-NXT treatment. NXT can improve myocardial injury, such as heart infarct size, pathological injury, myocardial fibrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration. Additionally, brain neuroinflammation induced by microglia after MI affects the expression and structure of ABCG4. Thus, ABCG4 could be the key protein associated with MI and neuroinflammation.",brain injury

Effect of Naoluoxintong formula and its split prescriptions on cerebral vascular regeneration in rats with the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion.,"['ShiXiao', 'WangLina', 'H UJianpeng', 'ZhangLimiao', 'WangJin']","To observe regulatory effect of Naoluoxintong formula (, NLXT) and its split prescriptions on vascular regeneration of rats suffering from cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (IR) syndrome of Qi deficiency with blood stasis (QDBS).
NLXT is the representative prescription of Yiqi Huoxue Tongluo decoction, and NLXT is divided into Yiqi herbs and Huoxue Tongluo herbs according to their efficacies. One hundred and eight specific-pathogen-free, clean-grade, Sprague-Dawley male rats were selected to prepare the classical rat model with QDBS due to middle artery ischemia-reperfusion using the multi-factor compound simulation approach. The animals were classified into sham operation (S), model (M), Nimodping (NMDP), NLXT, YQ and HXTL groups, each having 18 rats. Cerebral ischemia was reperfused after 2 h, and 24 h later, they were administered traditional Chinese medicine treatment for 14 d twice a day. Angiogenesis changes after NLXT administration to middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion (MCAO/R) rats with QDBS were analyzed using the neurological deficit score and hematoxylin-eosin staining. Cerebral infarct area by 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride was detected, and the ultrastructure of the blood vessel in the ischemic frontoparietal cortex was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), angiopoietin 2 (Ang2), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (CD31), angiopoietin receptor 2 (Tie2), and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) protein levels in the frontal and parietal cortex were quantified by immunofluorescence, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and Western blotting assays.
Relative to the S group, VEGFA and VEGFR2 levels in the frontal and parietal cortex of group M were increased, and Ang1, Ang2, Tie2, CD31, and p38 MAPK levels remarkably increased (
NLXT can promote the angiogenesis of the rat model of MCAO/R with QDBS by activating VEGFA and inhibiting P38 MAPK, and the effect is better than that of split prescription groups.",brain injury
Panax notoginseng: derived exosome-like nanoparticles attenuate ischemia reperfusion injury via altering microglia polarization.,"['ShiyiLi', 'RuZhang', 'AnniWang', 'YangLi', 'MiaomiaoZhang', 'JisuKim', 'YingZhu', 'QizhengWang', 'YueZhang', 'YingWei', 'JianxinWang']","Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/R) injury is a clinical conundrum during the treatment of ischemic stroke. Cell-derived exosomes (CDE) were proved to be therapeutically effective for CI/R injury. However, production of CDE is time and effort consuming. Increasing studies reported that plants can also generate exosome-like nanoparticles (ELN) which are therapeutically effective and have higher yield compared with CDE. In this study, a commonly used Chinese herb Panax notoginseng (PN), whose active ingredients were well-documented in the treatment of CI/R injury, was chosen as a source of ELNs. It was found that Panax notoginseng derived exosome like nanoparticles (PDN) could enter the brain without modification and ameliorate cerebral infarct volume, improve behavior outcome and maintained the integrity of BBB. PDNs attenuated CI/R injury by altering the phenotype of microglia from ""pro-inflammation"" M1 type to ""anti-inflammation"" M2 type. Also, we found that lipids from PDNs were the major therapeutic effective component. As a mechanism of action, PDN was proved to exert therapeutic effect via activating pI3k/Akt pathway.",brain injury
Walking against traffic and pedestrian injuries in the United Kingdom: new insights.,"['Akhmad FajriWidodo', 'ChenyiChen', 'Cheng-WeiChan', 'WafaaSaleh', 'Bayu SatriaWiratama', 'Chih-WeiPai']","Studies from Finland and Taiwan have shown that walking against traffic was beneficial for reducing pedestrian crashes and fatalities. This study examined whether such beneficial effects are consistent across various circumstances.
This study aimed to investigate pedestrian fatalities in walking-against or with-traffic crashes by analysing the UK STATS19 crash data for the period between 1991 and 2020. We firstly employed Chi-square tests to examine risk factors for pedestrian injury severity. These variables were then incorporated into stepwise logistic regression models with multiple variables. We subsequently conducted joint effect analysis to investigate whether the beneficial effects of walking against traffic on injury severity vary across different situations.
Our data contained 44,488 pedestrian crashes, of which 16,889 and 27,599 involved pedestrians walking against and with traffic, respectively. Pedestrians involved in with-traffic crashes were more likely to sustain fatalities (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.542; confidence interval [CI] = 1.139-1.927) compared with those in walking against-traffic crashes. The detrimental effect of walking with traffic on fatalities appeared to be more pronounced in darkness-unlit conditions (AOR = 1.48; CI = 1.29-1.70), during midnight hours (00:00-06:59 am) (AOR = 1.60; CI = 1.37-1.87), in rural areas (AOR = 2.20; CI = 1.92-2.51), when pedestrians were elderly (≥ 65 years old) (AOR = 2.65, CI = 2.16-3.26), and when heavy goods vehicles were crash partners (AOR = 1.51, CI = 1.28-1.78).
Walking against traffic was beneficial in reducing pedestrian fatalities compared with walking with traffic. Furthermore, such a beneficial effect was more pronounced in darkness-unlit conditions, at midnights (00:00-06:59 am), in rural areas, when pedestrians were elderly, and when heavy goods vehicles struck pedestrians.",brain injury
Intranasal Delivery of Mitochondria Attenuates Brain Injury by AMPK and SIRT1/PGC-1α Pathways in a Murine Model of Photothrombotic Stroke.,"['MohdSalman', 'Amanda SStayton', 'KehkashanParveen', 'ArshiParveen', 'Michelle APuchowicz', 'SuhelParvez', 'AmandeepBajwa', 'TauheedIshrat']","Ischemic stroke is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Mitochondria play a vital role in the pathological processes of cerebral ischemic injury, but its transplantation and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of mitochondrial therapy on the modulation of AMPK and SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway, oxidative stress, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation after photothrombotic ischemic stroke (pt-MCAO). The adult male mice were subjected to the pt-MCAO in which the proximal-middle cerebral artery was exposed with a 532-nm laser beam for 4 min by retro-orbital injection of a photosensitive dye (Rose Bengal: 15 mg/kg) before the laser light exposure and isolated mitochondria (100 μg protein) were administered intranasally at 30 min, 24 h, and 48 h following post-stroke. After 72 h, mice were tested for neurobehavioral outcomes and euthanized for infarct volume, brain edema, and molecular analysis. First, we found that mitochondria therapy significantly decreased brain infarct volume and brain edema, improved neurological dysfunction, attenuated ischemic stroke-induced oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Second, mitochondria treatment inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, mitochondria therapy accelerated p-AMPKα(Thr172) and PGC-1α expression and resorted SIRT1 protein expression levels in pt-MCAO mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that mitochondria therapy exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting oxidative damage and inflammation, mainly dependent on the heightening activation of the AMPK and SIRT1/PGC-1α signaling pathway. Thus, intranasal delivery of mitochondria might be considered a new therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke treatment.",brain injury
Molecular Mechanisms Associated with Neurodegeneration of Neurotropic Viral Infection.,"['PrapimpunWongchitrat', 'TheerawutChanmee', 'PiyaratGovitrapong']","Viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS) cause variable outcomes from acute to severe neurological sequelae with increased morbidity and mortality. Viral neuroinvasion directly or indirectly induces encephalitis via dysregulation of the immune response and contributes to the alteration of neuronal function and the degeneration of neuronal cells. This review provides an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of virus-induced neurodegeneration. Neurotropic viral infections influence many aspects of neuronal dysfunction, including promoting chronic inflammation, inducing cellular oxidative stress, impairing mitophagy, encountering mitochondrial dynamics, enhancing metabolic rewiring, altering neurotransmitter systems, and inducing misfolded and aggregated pathological proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. These pathogenetic mechanisms create a multidimensional injury of the brain that leads to specific neuronal and brain dysfunction. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the neurophathogenesis associated with neurodegeneration of viral infection may emphasize the strategies for prevention, protection, and treatment of virus infection of the CNS.",brain injury

Hippocampal slice preparations following closed-head, rotational acceleration injury in swine have previously demonstrated reduced axonal function and hippocampal circuitry disruption. However, electrophysiological changes in hippocampal neurons and their subtypes in a large animal mTBI model have not been examined. Using in vivo electrophysiology techniques, we examined laminar oscillatory field potentials and single unit activity in the hippocampal network 7 days post-injury in anesthetized minipigs. Concussion altered the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal cells and interneurons differently in area CA1. While the firing rate, spike width and amplitude of CA1 interneurons were significantly decreased post-mTBI, these parameters were unchanged in CA1 pyramidal neurons. In addition, CA1 pyramidal neurons in TBI animals were less entrained to hippocampal gamma (40-80 Hz) oscillations. Stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals also revealed hyperexcitability across the CA1 lamina post-mTBI. Computational simulations suggest that reported changes in interneuronal physiology may be due to alterations in voltage-gated sodium channels. These data demonstrate that a single concussion can lead to significant neuronal and circuit level changes in the hippocampus, which may contribute to cognitive dysfunction following mTBI.",brain injury
The elusive nature of the oligoclonal bands in multiple sclerosis.,"['Peter G EKennedy', 'WoroGeorge', 'XiaoliYu']","Intrathecal immunoglobulin G (IgG) and oligoclonal bands (OCBs) detected in both the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are seminal features of multiple sclerosis (MS). The presence of OCBs correlates with elevated disease burden and severity and supports the diagnosis of MS. Despite numerous investigations into the potential viral and autoantigen targets, the precise antigenic specificity of OCBs has remained elusive. We have little knowledge of the nature regarding these oligoclonal IgG bands. Here, we present compelling evidence highlighting the key findings that both OCBs and intrathecal IgG antibodies are under genetic control and that OCBs originate from clonal B-cells in both the periphery and CNS. We propose that MS OCBs are IgG immune complexes composed of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies and that the pathological role of OCB stems from the IgG effector functions of these complexes, leading to demyelination and axonal injuries. We present additional evidence regarding the nature of MS OCBs: (1) disease-modifying therapies have been shown to affect CSF OCB; (2) OCBs have also been detected in several neuroinfectious diseases; (3) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been particularly linked with MS pathogenesis, and its association with OCB is an important area of study. Although OCBs are closely associated with MS, more meticulously planned research is necessary to clarify the precise role of OCB in MS, both in terms of disease pathogenesis and diagnosis.",brain injury

In the present study, we developed a deep learning (DL) localization model to help localize the early infarction sign on NCCT. This retrospective study included consecutive 517 ischemic stroke (IS) patients who received NCCT within 12 h after stroke onset. A total of 21,436 infarction patches and 20,391 non-infarction patches were extracted from the slice pool of 1,634 NCCT according to brain symmetricity property. The generated patches were fed into different pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) models such as Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16), GoogleNet, Residual Networks 50 (ResNet50), Inception-ResNet-v2 (IR-v2), Inception-v3 and Inception-v4. The selected VGG16 model could detect the early infarction in both supratentorial and infratentorial regions to achieve an average area under curve (AUC) 0.73 after extensive customization. The properly tuned-VGG16 model could identify the early infarction in the cortical, subcortical and cortical plus subcortical areas of supratentorial region with the mean AUC > 0.70. Further, the model could attain 95.6% of accuracy on recognizing infarction lesion in 494 out of 517 IS patients.",brain injury
Deep brain stimulation in disorders of consciousness: 10 years of a single center experience.,"['DarkoChudy', 'VedranDeletis', 'VeronikaParadžik', 'IvanDubroja', 'PetarMarčinković', 'DarkoOrešković', 'HanaChudy', 'MarinaRaguž']","Disorders of consciousness (DoC), namely unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) and minimally conscious state (MCS), represent severe conditions with significant consequences for patients and their families. Several studies have reported the regaining of consciousness in such patients using deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subcortical structures or brainstem nuclei. Our study aims to present the 10 years' experience of a single center using DBS as a therapy on a cohort of patients with DoC. Eighty Three consecutive patients were evaluated between 2011 and 2022; entry criteria consisted of neurophysiological and neurological evaluations and neuroimaging examinations. Out of 83, 36 patients were considered candidates for DBS implantation, and 32 patients were implanted: 27 patients had UWS, and five had MCS. The stimulation target was the centromedian-parafascicular complex in the left hemisphere in hypoxic brain lesion or the one better preserved in patients with traumatic brain injury. The level of consciousness was improved in seven patients. Three out of five MCS patients emerged to full awareness, with the ability to interact and communicate. Two of them can live largely independently. Four out of 27 UWS patients showed consciousness improvement with two patients emerging to full awareness, and the other two reaching MCS. In patients with DoC lasting longer than 12 months following traumatic brain injury or 6 months following anoxic-ischemic brain lesion, spontaneous recovery is rare. Thus, DBS of certain thalamic nuclei could be recommended as a treatment option for patients who meet neurological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging criteria, especially in earlier phases, before occurrence of irreversible musculoskeletal changes. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of cooperation between centers worldwide in studies on the potentials of DBS in treating patients with DoC.",brain injury

In pain-injured rats miR-203a-3p was the most highly upregulated miRNA in the ARC. A similar increase was identified in the cerebrospinal fluid of trigeminal neuralgia patients. Mechanistically, we found histone deacetylase 9 was downregulated following nerve injury, which decreased deacetylation of histone H3 lysine-18, facilitating the binding of NR4A2 transcription factor to the miR-203a-3p gene promoter, thereby upregulating miR-203a-3p expression. Further, increased miR-203a-3p was found to maintain neuropathic pain by targeting proprotein convertase 1, an endopeptidase necessary for the cleavage of proopiomelanocortin, the precursor of β-EP. The identified mechanism may provide an avenue for the development of new therapeutic targets for neuropathic pain treatment.",brain injury
Effect of valproic acid combined with transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells modified by neurotrophic 3 gene on nerve protection and repair after traumatic brain injury.,"['HaimingLi', 'ZhijieYin', 'ShuangzhuYue', 'YunyingAn', 'XiaoyinWang', 'ShifangZhou', 'LeiMeng', 'BaozheJin']","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often leads to cognitive and neurological dysfunction. Valproic acid (VPA) has a neuroprotective effect in acute central nervous system diseases; the neurotrophin 3 gene (NT-3) can maintain the survival of neurons, and olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) can promote the growth of nerve axons. This study aimed to evaluate the restorative effect of VPA combined with NT-3 modified OECs (NT-3-OECs) on neurological function after TBI.
The neurological severity score (NSS) of rats was evaluated on the 1st, 7th, 14th, and 28th day after TBI modeling and corresponding intervention. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, p75 nerve growth factor receptor (P75), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament protein (NF)staining, and argyrophilic staining were used to observe the morphology of brain tissue 28 days after modeling. Moreover, TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) was used to detect the apoptosis rate of neurons. The changes in synapses and mitochondria in the injured area were observed by electron microscope.
NT-3-OECs transplantation can increase the content of NT-3 in brain tissue, and NT-3-OECs can survive for >28 days. The NSS score of the TBI-VPA-NT-3-OECs group 28 days after cell transplantation was significantly lower than that of the other model treatment groups (P < 0.05). The morphological structure of the brain tissue was more complete, and the neurofilament fibers were neatly arranged, achieving better results than those of the other groups. The apoptosis rate of nerve cells in the TBI-VPA-NT-3-OECs group was significantly lower than in the other treatment groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the number of synapses in the combined intervention group was significantly higher than in the other treatment groups, and the mitochondrial structure was more complete.
NT-3-OECs have good biological function, and VPA combined with NT-3-OECs transplantation can effectively improve the prognosis of TBI rats.",brain injury
"Evaluation of Cerebral Infarction by Carotid Doppler Ultrasound Combined with Cysteine, D Dimer, and Other Indexes.","['YuliangYin', 'LetaoYu']","Cerebral infarction, formerly known as ischemic stroke, refers to localized ischemic necrosis or softening caused by disorders of blood supply to the brain, ischemia, or hypoxia. Cerebral infarction is characterized by high mortality and morbidity. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis of cerebral infarction is of great significance to the selection of treatment and prognosis of patients. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the traditional method for diagnosing myocardial infarction. However, ECG diagnosis of myocardial infarction based on electrophysiological manifestations of cardiac electrostimulation can only indirectly reflect the anatomical lesions, and can not diagnose the lesions in special parts of the heart, so there are diagnostic limitations, there will be certain missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis.
Our study aimed to assess the effect of carotid Doppler ultrasound combined with cysteine, D dimer, and other indexes in the clinical diagnosis of cerebral infarction, in order to provide effective basis for early diagnosis and treatment of cerebral infarction patients.
This study was a retrospective study.
This study was carried out in First Affiliated Hospital, Anhui University of Science and Technology (Huainan First People's Hospital) from November 2020 to December 2022.
A total of 40 patients with cerebral infarction were selected as the observation group (OG). At the same time, 40 healthy people who underwent physical examinations were selected as the control group (CG). There were 21 males and 19 females in the OG. The age ranged from 59 to 76 years, with an average of (67.11±0.23) years. There were 23 males and 17 females in the CG. The age ranged from 58 to 77 years, with an average of (68.04±0.35) years.
Both groups of subjects underwent carotid Doppler ultrasound examination to observe the number of carotid plaque formation, the carotid artery intimal thickness and the lumen diameter. Besides, serum homocysteine (Hcy) and cystatin C (Cys-C) levels of the subjects were detected by an automatic biochemical analyzer and supporting reagents. The serum high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) levels of the two groups were detected by immune turbidimetry. The plasma levels of D-dimer (D-D) and fibrinogen (FIB) were detected by immunoturbidimetric method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was implemented to analyze the value of Color Carotid Doppler ultrasound combined with Hcy, Cys-C, hsCRP, D-D and FIB detection in diagnosing cerebral infarction.
(1) Carotid Doppler ultrasound can observe cardiac morphological changes from multiple angles and planes, and diagnose myocardial infarction according to the changes of ventricular wall structure caused by myocardial ischemia. It has the advantages of simple operation and high image quality. (2) The hemodynamic parameters of the bilateral common carotid artery and internal carotid artery, (3) Serum Hcy, Cys-C, and hsCRP levels, as well as plasma levels of D-D and FIB. Hcy is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and the Hcy level is directly related to the pre-onset of cerebral infarction patients. Cys-C is an ideal endogenous marker to reflect the change of glomerular filtration rate. In recent years, it has been found that the interaction of Cys-C, Hcy and cathepsin is involved in the pathological process of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, aneurysm and myocardial infarction. hsCRP can reflect left ventricular function, myocardial injury, inflammation and other conditions, which is helpful to evaluate the condition of cerebral infarction patients. D-D can reflect the coagulation function of the body, and its high expression can indicate that the body is in a state of hypercoagulation, accompanied by secondary hyperfibrinolysis, and is often used in the clinical diagnosis of cerebral infarction. FIB is an important factor contributing to atherosclerosis and plays an important role in the occurrence and development of cerebral infarction. (4) ROC curve results.
The number of carotid plaque formation in the OG was significantly higher compared to the CG (P < .05). The carotid artery intimal thickness in the OG was relatively elevated relative to the CG (P < .05). The lumen diameter was smaller in the OG compared to the CG (P < .05). The peak systolic velocity and end-diastolic velocity of the left and right common carotid artery and the left and right internal carotid artery in the OG declined compared to the CG, and the resistance index of the left and right common carotid artery and the left and right internal carotid artery in the OG was elevated compared to the CG (P < .05). The serum levels of Hcy, Cys-C, and hsCRP, as well as plasma levels of D-D and FIB in the OG, were elevated compared to the CG (<.05). The sensitivity and specificity of Color Carotid Doppler ultrasound combined with Hcy, Cys-C, hsCRP, D-D and FIB in the diagnosis of AMI were 0.919 and 0.817 respectively, significantly higher than that predicted by alone (P < .001).
Carotid Doppler ultrasound combined with cysteine, D dimer, and other indexes played an important role in the clinical diagnosis of cerebral infarction, which was worthy of promotion. Our experimental results provide an important basis for the clinical scientific application of Carotid Doppler ultrasound and myocardial marker detection, especially for those AMI patients with no abnormal changes in ECG and no obvious clinical symptoms, it can realize early diagnosis and timely treatment, and reduce the mortality of AMI.",brain injury
Blockade of connexin hemichannels with tonabersat protects against mild hypoxic ischemic brain injury in neonatal rats.,"['AliceMcDouall', 'GuidoWassink', 'SumuduRanasinghe', 'Kelly QZhou', 'Rashika NKarunasinghe', 'Justin MDean', 'Joanne ODavidson']","There is growing evidence that infants with mild hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy have increased risk of brain injury and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Currently, there is no approved treatment for these infants. It was previously shown that blocking connexin 43 hemichannels is neuroprotective in models of moderate to severe HI injury. However, it is yet to be established whether these channels play a role in the evolution of mild HI brain injury, and whether blocking these channels after mild HI is neuroprotective.
HI was induced in postnatal day 10 rats of both sexes by right carotid artery ligation followed by 80 min of hypoxia in 8% oxygen. Pups receiving HI were randomised to receive intraperitoneal injections of either saline, vehicle (2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin polyethylene glycol-400), or tonabersat (2 mg/kg), at 60 min, 24 h, and 48 h after hypoxia. Seven days after HI, brains were harvested for measurement of volume loss and histological analysis.
HI resulted in a significant reduction in hemispheric, hippocampal, and white matter volumes, which were significantly attenuated after treatment with tonabersat. HI was also associated with a significant reduction in numbers of neurons in the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal regions, a reduction in the numbers of oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum, and an increase in the number of astrocytes in both regions, which were significantly attenuated by tonabersat treatment. There were no differences in rectal temperatures between tonabersat- and vehicle-treated rat pups.
Blockade of connexin hemichannels with tonabersat significantly reduced mild HI injury in the hippocampus and white matter, without causing hypothermia.",brain injury
Association of postoperative hypernatremia with outcomes after elective craniotomy.,"['TianguiLi', 'YuZhang', 'XingChen', 'LuJia', 'YixingTian', 'JialingHe', 'MiaoHe', 'LvlinChen', 'PengfeiHao', 'YangchunXiao', 'LiyuanPeng', 'WeelicChong', 'YangHai', 'ChaoYou', 'FangFang']","Hypernatremia is a treatable biochemical disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing surgery. However, its impact on patients who undergo elective craniotomy is not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic implications of postoperative hypernatremia on the 30-day mortality of patients undergoing elective craniotomy.
Retrospective cohort study.
The Department of Neurosurgery of a high-volume center.
Adult patients undergoing elective craniotomy except those with pituitary tumors, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or traumatic brain injury.
None.
Perioperative laboratory data were collected for all study participants, including sodium levels, neutrophil count, serum albumin, lymphocyte count, and blood glucose. These measurements were obtained as part of routine clinical care and provided valuable information for data analysis.
Of the 10,223 identified elective craniotomy patients who met our inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14.9% (1519) developed postoperative hypernatremia. This population's overall postoperative 30-day mortality rate was 1.7% (175). After performing an adjusted logistic regression analysis, we found that the odds of 30-day mortality increased gradually with increasing severity of hypernatremia: 2.9 deaths (OR, 3.79; 95% CI, 2.46-5.85) in patients with mild hypernatremia, 13.9 deaths (OR, 17.73; 95% CI, 11.17-28.12) in those with moderate hypernatremia, and 38.3 deaths (OR, 67.00; 95% CI, 40.44-111.00) in those with severe hypernatremia.
Hypernatremia is common after elective craniotomy, and its presence is associated with increased mortality and complications, particularly in cases of severe hypernatremia. These results emphasize the significance of risk evaluation in neurosurgical patients and propose the advantages of closely monitoring serum sodium levels in high-risk individuals. Future randomized controlled trials could provide more insight into the effect of treating postoperative hypernatremia in these patients.",brain injury
Association of blood pressure parameters post mechanical thrombectomy in anemic versus non-anemic patients and clinical outcomes.,"['TahaNisar', 'ToluwalaseTofade', 'KonradLebioda', 'ShaulShaulov', 'SaraShapouran', 'OsamaAbu-Hadid', 'PriyankKhandelwal']","Higher blood pressure (BP) is considered to be detrimental in patients who undergo mechanical thrombectomy (MT), however, the impact of BP post-MT based on comorbidities like anemia has not been well studied. We aim to determine the association of 24-h post-MT BP parameters with clinical outcomes depending on their anemia status.
We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent MT at a comprehensive stroke center from 1/2015 to 12/2020. Patients were dichotomized into anemic and non-anemic groups based on the World Health Organization's definition of anemia [hemoglobin < 12.0 g/dL in women and < 13.0 g/dL in men]. We performed a multivariable analysis with binary logistic regression with the 24-h post-MT BP parameters as predictors. The outcomes were functional dependence (3-month mRS 3-6), mortality, and an early neurological improvement.
220 patients met the inclusion criteria. 158 (71.82 %) patients had functional dependence at 3-months. In the multivariable analysis, the parameters of a higher mean SBP (132.9 ± 11.94 vs.126.52 ± 13.3; OR, 1.05; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.09; P 0.011), a higher mean MAP (93.35 ± 8.44 vs.89.69 ± 10.03; OR,1.06; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.11; P 0.029) and a higher maximum MAP (115.26 ± 11.73 vs.109.37 ± 12.51; OR,1.05; 95 % CI, 1.01-1.08; P 0.023)were significantly associated with functional dependence in non-anemic patients, while a lower mean DBP (65.53 ± 9.73 vs. 71.94 ± 10.16; OR, 0.92; 95 % CI, 0.86-0.98; P 0.007), lower mean MAP (85.7 ± 8.65 vs. 91.38 ± 10; OR, 0.93; 95 % CI, 0.86-0.99; P 0.02), a lower minimum DBP (49.27 ± 10.51 vs. 55.1 ± 11.23; OR, 0.93; 95 % CI, 0.88-0.99; P 0.019), a lower minimum MAP (68.96 ± 9.54 vs. 74.73 ± 10.47; OR, 0.93; 95 % CI, 0.87-0.99; P 0.023) were significantly associated with mortality in patients with anemia, and a lower minimum DBP (54.75 ± 10.42 vs. 59.69 ± 8.87; OR, 0.95; 95 % CI, 0.91-0.99; P 0.012) and a lower minimum MAP (71.92 ± 14.7 vs.75.67 ± 14.17; OR, 0.97; 95 % CI, 0.94-0.99; P 0.047) were significantly associated with an early neurological improvement in non-anemic patients. For patients with anemia, there was no association between 24-hour BP Parameters post-MT and functional dependence and early neurological improvement, and between 24-hour BP Parameters post-MT and mortality in non-anemic patients.
In our study, higher BP parameters were associated with worse outcomes in patients without anemia, however, this effect was not found in patients with anemia. Certain lower BP parameters were associated with higher 3-month mortality in anemic patients; however, this effect was not found in non-anemic patients. Higher BP post-MT can potentially promote perfusion and thus is not associated with worse outcomes in anemic patients post-MT, whereas in non-anemic patients it may potentially lead to reperfusion injury While our study is limited because of size and its retrospective nature, the findings suggest that an individualized approach to tailor the target BP post-MT to a patient's risk factor profile and associated co-morbid conditions to achieve optimization of medical care post-MT and associated co-morbid conditions to achieve optimization of medical care post-MT.",brain injury
Reversal of pre-injury factor-Xa inhibitors with prothrombin complex concentrates in patients following traumatic brain injury.,"['Jeffrey FBarletta', 'Gina RShirah', 'Alicia JMangram', 'Joseph FSucher', 'Sarah AHostert', 'KimberliBruce', 'HayleySprings', 'VictorZach']","There is substantial debate on the best method to reverse factor Xa-inhibitors in patients following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) have been used for this indication but their role has been questioned. This study reported failure rates with PCC in patients following TBI and as a secondary objective, compared 4-factor (4 F-PCC) and activated PCC (APCC).
Consecutive patients with TBI on factor Xa-inhibitors admitted to one of two trauma centers were retrospectively identified. Patients with penetrating TBI, delays in PCC administration (>6 h), receipt of tranexamic acid, factor VIIa or no follow up CT-scan were excluded. The primary outcome was treatment failure defined as hematoma expansion > 20% from baseline for SDH, EDH or IPH, a new hematoma not present on the initial CT scan or any expansion of a SAH or IVH. Hematoma expansion was further categorized as symptomatic or asymptomatic, designated by a change in the motor GCS score, neurologic exam or change ≥ 3 in NIH Stroke Scale. Multi-variate analysis was performed.
There were 43 patients with a mean age of 77 ± 13 years with primarily mild TBI (95%) after a ground level fall (79%). The mean dose was 41 ± 12 units/kg. Sixty percent received 4 F-PCC and 40% APCC. The incidence of treatment failure was 28% (12/43). Of the 12 patients with hematoma expansion, only 3 were symptomatic (9.3%). Hematoma expansion with 4 F-PCC and APCC were similar (27% vs. 29%,p = .859). Only sex was associated with hematoma expansion on multivariate analysis [OR (95% CI) = 6.7 (1.1 - 40.9)].
PCC was an effective option for factor Xa inhibitor reversal following TBI. The relationship between radiographic expansion and clinical expansion was poor.",brain injury
OPRM1 and BDNF polymorphisms associated with a compensatory neurophysiologic signature in knee osteoarthritis patients.,"['Fernanda de ToledoGonçalves', 'Lucas MurrinsMarques', 'Anne VictórioPessotto', 'Sara PintoBarbosa', 'MartaImamura', 'MarcelSimis', 'FelipeFregni', 'LinamaraBattistella']","The present study investigated the relationship between three genetic polymorphisms of OPRM1 (rs1799971 - A118G and rs1799972 - C17T) and BDNF (rs6265 - C196T) and EEG-measured brain oscillations in Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) patients.
We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study (DEFINE cohort), KOA arm, with 66 patients, considering demographic (age, sex, and education), clinical (pain intensity and duration), OPRM1 (rs1799971 - A118G and rs1799972 - C17T) and BDNF (rs6265 - C196T) genotypes, and electrophysiological measures. Brain oscillations relative power from Delta, Theta, Alpha, Low Alpha, High Alpha, Beta, Low Beta and High Beta oscillations were measured during resting state EEG. Multivariate regression models were used to explore the main brain oscillation predictors of the three genetic polymorphisms.
Our findings demonstrate that Theta and Low Beta oscillations are associated with the variant allele of OPRM1-rs1799971 (A118G) on left frontal and left central regions, respectively, while Alpha brain oscillation is associated with variant genotypes (CT/TT) of BDNF-rs6265 on frontal (decrease of oscillation power) and left central (increase of oscillation power) regions. No significant model was found for OPRM1-rs1799972 (C17T) in addition to the inclusion of pain intensity as a significant predictor of this last model.
One potential interpretation for these findings is that polymorphisms of OPRM1 - that is involved with endogenous pain control - lead to increased compensatory oscillatory mechanisms, characterized by increased theta oscillations. Along the same line, polymorphisms of the BDNF lead to decreased alpha oscillations in the frontal area, likely also reflecting the disruption of resting states to also compensate for the increased injury associated with knee OA. It is possible that these polymorphisms require additional brain adaption to the knee OA related injury.",brain injury
The critical role of technologies in neonatal care.,"['SyedTaha', 'Rosalind BSimpson', 'DonSharkey']","Neonatal care has made significant advances in the last few decades. As a result, mortality and morbidity in high-risk infants, such as extremely preterm infants or those infants with birth-related brain injury, has reduced significantly. Many of these advances have been facilitated or delivered through development of medical technologies allowing clinical teams to be better supported with the care they deliver or provide new therapies and diagnostics to improve management. The delivery of neonatal intensive care requires the provision of medical technologies that are easy to use, reliable, accurate and ideally developed for the unique needs of the newborn population. Many technologies have been developed and commercialised following adult trials without ever being studied in neonatal patients despite the unique characteristics of this population. Increasingly, funders and industry are recognising this major challenge which has resulted in initiatives to develop new ideas from concept through to clinical care. This review explores some of the key medical technologies used in neonatal care and the evidence to support their adoption to improve outcomes. A number of devices have yet to realise their full potential and will require further development to optimise and find their ideal target population and clinical benefit. Examples of emerging technologies, which may soon become more widely used, are also discussed. As neonatal care relies more on medical technologies, we need to be aware of the impact on care pathways, especially from a human factors approach, the associated costs and subsequent benefits to patients alongside the supporting evidence.",brain injury
Communication between rehabilitation staff and people with traumatic brain injury: A systematic review.,"['IbenChristensen', 'EmmaPower', 'LeanneTogher', 'SophieBrassel', 'EliseElbourn', 'NaomiFolder', 'Lise RandrupJensen']","This systematic review aimed to synthesize barriers and facilitators in communicative interactions between staff and people with traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the rehabilitation context. Searches captured published evidence up to November 2022 in MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Science, CINAHL, AMED, and PsycINFO. Eligible studies reported on the communicative interaction between rehabilitation staff and adults with TBI. In total, 31 studies were included in the review; including quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods designs. Quality assessment was carried out using standard checklists. Quantitative studies and quantitative components of mixed-method studies were synthesized descriptively according to reported communication barriers and facilitators. Qualitative studies and qualitative components of mixed-method studies were analysed through an inductive thematic meta-synthesis; generating six main themes with four subthemes. Themes were categorized as barriers or facilitators to communicative interaction. Findings demonstrated that cognitive-communication disorders of people with TBI challenge the communicative interaction between rehabilitation staff and people with TBI. However, the extent to which these disorders create a communicative barrier is closely related to staff's communicative approach. While staff holding a collaborative and acknowledging approach and using supportive strategies may facilitate successful communicative interactions, staff using the opposite approach may exacerbate communication barriers.",brain injury
Using normative modeling and machine learning for detecting mild traumatic brain injury from magnetoencephalography data.,"['VeeraItälinna', 'HannaKaltiainen', 'NinaForss', 'MiaLiljeström', 'LauriParkkonen']","New biomarkers are urgently needed for many brain disorders; for example, the diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is challenging as the clinical symptoms are diverse and nonspecific. EEG and MEG studies have demonstrated several population-level indicators of mTBI that could serve as objective markers of brain injury. However, deriving clinically useful biomarkers for mTBI and other brain disorders from EEG/MEG signals is hampered by the large inter-individual variability even across healthy people. Here, we used a multivariate machine-learning approach to detect mTBI from resting-state MEG measurements. To address the heterogeneity of the condition, we employed a normative modeling approach and modeled MEG signal features of individual mTBI patients as deviations with respect to the normal variation. To this end, a normative dataset comprising 621 healthy participants was used to determine the variation in power spectra across the cortex. In addition, we constructed normative datasets based on age-matched subsets of the full normative data. To discriminate patients from healthy control subjects, we trained support-vector-machine classifiers on the quantitative deviation maps for 25 mTBI patients and 20 controls not included in the normative dataset. The best performing classifier made use of the full normative data across the entire age and frequency ranges. This classifier was able to distinguish patients from controls with an accuracy of 79%. Inspection of the trained model revealed that low-frequency activity in the theta frequency band (4-8 Hz) is a significant indicator of mTBI, consistent with earlier studies. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using normative modeling of MEG data combined with machine learning to advance diagnosis of mTBI and identify patients that would benefit from treatment and rehabilitation. The current approach could be applied to a wide range of brain disorders, thus providing a basis for deriving MEG/EEG-based biomarkers.",brain injury
Prehospital high-dose methylprednisolone in resuscitated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients (STEROHCA): a randomized clinical trial.,"['Laust E RObling', 'Rasmus PBeske', 'Martin A SMeyer', 'JohannesGrand', 'SebastianWiberg', 'BenjaminNyholm', 'JakobJosiassen', 'Frederik TSøndergaard', 'ThomasMohr', 'AndersDamm-Hejmdal', 'MetteBjerre', 'RuthFrikke-Schmidt', 'FredrikFolke', 'Jacob EMøller', 'JesperKjaergaard', 'ChristianHassager']","Patients who are successfully resuscitated following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are still at a high risk of neurological damage and death. Inflammation and brain injury are components of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome, and can be assessed by systemic interleukin 6 (IL-6) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). Anti-inflammatory treatment with methylprednisolone may dampen inflammation, thereby improving outcome. This study aimed to determine if prehospital high-dose methylprednisolone could reduce IL-6 and NSE in comatose OHCA patients.
The STEROHCA trial was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, phase II prehospital trial performed at two cardiac arrest centers in Denmark. Resuscitated comatose patients with suspected cardiac etiology were randomly assigned 1:1 to a single intravenous injection of 250 mg methylprednisolone or placebo. The co-primary outcome was reduction of IL-6 and NSE-blood levels measured daily for 72 h from admission. The main secondary outcome was survival at 180 days follow-up.
We randomized 137 patients to methylprednisolone (n = 68) or placebo (n = 69). We found reduced IL-6 levels (p < 0.0001) in the intervention group, with median (interquartile range, IQR) levels at 24 h of 2.1 pg/ml (1.0; 7.1) and 30.7 pg/ml (14.2; 59) in the placebo group. We observed no difference between groups in NSE levels (p = 0.22), with levels at 48 h of 18.8 ug/L (14.4; 24.6) and 14.8 ug/L (11.2; 19.4) in the intervention and placebo group, respectively. In the intervention group, 51 (75%) patients survived and 44 (64%) in the placebo group.
Prehospital treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone to resuscitated comatose OHCA patients, resulted in reduced IL-6 levels after 24 h, but did not reduce NSE levels.",brain injury
Invasive Brain Computer Interface for Motor Restoration in Spinal Cord Injury: A Systematic Review.,"['Jordan JLevett', 'Lior MElkaim', 'FarbodNiazi', 'Michael HWeber', 'ChristianIorio-Morin', 'MarcoBonizzato', 'Alexander GWeil']","Systematic review of the literature.
In recent years, brain-computer interface (BCI) has emerged as a potential treatment for patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). This is the first systematic review of the literature on invasive closed-loop BCI technologies for the treatment of SCI in humans.
A comprehensive search of PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Ovid EMBASE was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.
Of 8316 articles collected, 19 studies met all the inclusion criteria. Data from 21 patients were extracted from these studies. All patients sustained a cervical SCI and were treated using either a BCI with intracortical microelectrode arrays (n = 18, 85.7%) or electrocorticography (n = 3, 14.3%). To decode these neural signals, machine learning and statistical models were used: support vector machine in eight patients (38.1%), linear estimator in seven patients (33.3%), Hidden Markov Model in three patients (14.3%), and other in three patients (14.3%). As the outputs, ten patients (47.6%) underwent noninvasive functional electrical stimulation (FES) with a cuff; one (4.8%) had an invasive FES with percutaneous stimulation, and ten (47.6%) used an external device (neuroprosthesis or virtual avatar). Motor function was restored in all patients for each assigned task. Clinical outcome measures were heterogeneous across all studies.
Invasive techniques of BCI show promise for the treatment of SCI, but there is currently no technology that can restore complete functional autonomy in patients with SCI. The current techniques and outcomes of BCI vary greatly. Because invasive BCIs are still in the early stages of development, further clinical studies should be conducted to optimize the prognosis for patients with SCI.",brain injury
Neuroinflammation drives sex-dependent effects on pain and negative affect in a murine model of repeated mild traumatic brain injury.,"['Shiwei SteveLiu', 'SarahPickens', 'ZackBarta', 'MyraRice', 'MerelDagher', 'RyanLebens', 'Theodore VNguyen', 'Brian JCummings', 'Catherine MCahill']","The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 75% of reported cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are mild, where chronic pain and depression are 2 of the most common symptoms. In this study, we used a murine model of repeated mild TBI to characterize the associated pain hypersensitivity and affective-like behavior and to what extent microglial reactivity contributes to these behavioral phenotypes. Male and female C57BL/6J mice underwent sham or repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) and were tested for up to 9 weeks postinjury, where an anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective drug (minocycline) was introduced at 5 weeks postinjury in the drinking water. Repeated mild traumatic brain injury mice developed cold nociceptive hypersensitivity and negative affective states, as well as increased locomotor activity and risk-taking behavior. Minocycline reversed negative affect and pain hypersensitivities in male but not female mice. Repeated mild traumatic brain injury also produced an increase in microglial and brain-derived neurotropic factor mRNA transcripts in limbic structures known to be involved in nociception and affect, but many of these changes were sex dependent. Finally, we show that the antiepileptic drug, gabapentin, produced negative reinforcement in male rmTBI mice that was prevented by minocycline treatment, whereas rmTBI female mice showed a place aversion to gabapentin. Collectively, pain hypersensitivity, increased tonic-aversive pain components, and negative affective states were evident in both male and female rmTBI mice, but suppression of microglial reactivity was only sufficient to reverse behavioral changes in male mice.

Thirty-five cases of PRES occurred in 32 patients (8 after allo-HSCT and 27 during CT) were included in this study. In the most of cases (94.3%), there were 2 and more RF. An increase in blood pressure level (88.6%), CT and IST (82.8%) administration, steroid therapy (71.4%) were the most significant for PRES development. Infectious process and the decline in renal function played a lesser role in this syndrome (31.4% and 14%).

Оценка факторов риска (ФР) и тяжести течения синдрома задней обратимой энцефалопатии (PRES) у детей с заболеваниями системы крови.
Проанализированы случаи PRES у детей с заболеваниями системы крови на этапах полихимиотерапии (ПХТ) и после аллогенной трансплантации гемопоэтических стволовых клеток (алло-ТГСК). Оцениваемые ФР: артериальная гипертензия, терапия глюкокортикостероидами (ГКС), ПХТ/иммуносупрессивная терапия (ИСТ), инфекционный процесс, нарушение почечной функции.
В анализ включено 35 случаев PRES у 32 детей (8 — после алло-ТГСК, 27 — на этапах ПХТ). В большинстве (94,3%) наблюдений PRES развился у пациентов с двумя ФР и более. Наиболее значимыми ФР были: повышение артериального давления (88,6%), проводимая ПХТ и ИСТ (82,8%), терапия ГКС (71,4%).

Heat-shock protein A12A attenuates oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation-induced human brain microvascular endothelial cell dysfunction via PGC-1α/SIRT3 pathway.,"['JunLi', 'ShouyinShen', 'HaiyanShen']","Ischemic stroke is a life-threatening brain disease with the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Heat-shock protein A12A (HSPA12A) is recognized as a neuroprotective target for treating ischemic stroke; however, its regulatory mechanism has been not fully elucidated yet. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) were induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic ischemic stroke. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were conducted to explore the regulation of HSAPA12 and PGC-1α. Cell viability, apoptosis, and permeability were assessed by CCK-8, TUNEL, and transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) assays, respectively. The expression of HSPA12A and corresponding proteins was measured by western blot. Cell immunofluorescence was adopted to evaluate ZO-1 expression. THP-1 cells were applied to adhere hBMECs in vitro to simulate leukocyte adhesion in the brain. HSPA12A was downregulated in OGD/R-treated hBMECs. HSPA12A overexpression significantly suppressed OGD/R-induced cell viability loss and apoptosis in hBMECs. Meanwhile, HSPA12A overexpression attenuated blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in OGD/R-induced hBMECs, evidenced by the restored TEER value and the upregulated ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5. HSPA12A also restricted OGD/R-induced attachment of THP-1 cells to hBMECs, accompanied with downregulating ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Additionally, OGD/R-caused downregulation of PGC-1α/SIRT3 in hBMECs was partly restored by HSPA12A overexpression. Furthermore, the above effects of HSPA12A on OGD/R-induced hBMECs injury were partly reversed by PGC-1α knockdown. HSPA12A plays a protective role against OGD/R-induced hBMECs injury by upregulating PGC-1α, providing a potential neuroprotective role of HSPA12A in ischemic stroke.",brain injury

A systematic review of the neuropathology and memory decline induced by monosodium glutamate in the Alzheimer's disease-like animal model.,"['Singh SAnkul', 'LakshmiChandran', 'SinghAnuragh', 'IlangoKaliappan', 'RapuruRushendran', 'ChitraVellapandian']","This systematic review analyzes monosodium glutamate (MSG) in the Alzheimer's disease-like condition to enhance translational research. Our review seeks to understand how MSG affects the brain and causes degenerative disorders. Due to significant preclinical data linking glutamate toxicity to Alzheimer's disease and the lack of a comprehensive review or meta-analysis, we initiated a study on MSG's potential link. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, DOAJ, and Scopus for animal research and English language papers without time constraints. This study used the PRISMA-P framework and PICO technique to collect population, intervention or exposure, comparison, and result data. It was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42022371502. MSG affected mice's exploratory behaviors and short-term working memory. The brain, hippocampus, and cerebellar tissue demonstrated neuronal injury-related histological and histomorphometric changes. A total of 70% of MSG-treated mice had poor nesting behavior. The treated mice also had more hyperphosphorylated tau protein in their cortical and hippocampus neurons. Glutamate and glutamine levels in the brain increased with MSG, and dose-dependent mixed horizontal locomotor, grooming, and anxiety responses reduced. MSG treatment significantly decreased phospho-CREB protein levels, supporting the idea that neurons were harmed, despite the increased CREB mRNA expression. High MSG doses drastically lower brain tissue and serum serotonin levels. In conclusion, MSG showed AD-like pathology, neuronal atrophy, and short-term memory impairment. Further research with a longer time span and deeper behavioral characterization is needed. ",brain injury
Multiple ammonia-induced episodes of hepatic encephalopathy provoke neuronal cell loss in bile-duct ligated rats.,"['FarzanehTamnanloo', 'RafaelOchoa-Sanchez', 'Mariana MOliveira', 'CarinaLima', 'MaggyLépine', 'KarineDubois', 'CristinaBosoi', 'MélanieTremblay', 'LekhaSleno', 'Christopher FRose']","Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is defined as a reversible syndrome and therefore should resolve following liver transplantation (LT). However, neurological complications have been reported in up to 47% of LT recipients, which have been documented to be associated with a history of overt HE pre-LT. We hypothesise that multiple episodes of HE lead to permanent cell injury and exacerbate neurological dysfunction. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of cumulative HE episodes on neurological status and brain integrity in rats with chronic liver disease.
Episodes of overt HE (loss of righting reflex) were induced following injection of ammonium acetate in bile duct ligation (BDL) rats (BDL-Ammonia) every 4 days starting at week 3 post-BDL. Neurobehaviour was evaluated after the last episode. Upon sacrifice, plasma ammonia, systemic oxidative stress, and inflammation markers were assessed. Neuronal markers including neuron-specific nuclear antigen and SMI311 (anti-neurofilament marker) and apoptotic markers (cleaved caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl2) were measured. Total antioxidant capacity, oxidative stress marker (4-hydroxynonenal), and proinflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1β) were measured in brain (hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum). Proteomic analysis was conducted in the hippocampus.
In hippocampus of BDL-Ammonia rats, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax/Bcl2 ratio were significantly increased, whereas NeuN and SMI311 were significantly decreased compared with BDL-Vehicle rats. Higher levels of oxidative stress-induced post-translational modified proteins were found in hippocampus of BDL-Ammonia group which were associated with a lower total antioxidant capacity.
Ammonia-induced episodes of overt HE caused neuronal cell injury/death in BDL rats. These results suggest that multiple bouts of HE can be detrimental on the integrity of the brain, translating to irreversibility and hence neurological complications post-LT.
Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is defined as a reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome resolving following liver transplantation (LT); however, ∼47% of patients demonstrate neurological impairments after LT, which are associated with a previous history of overt HE pre-LT. Our study indicates that multiple episodes of overt HE can cause permanent neuronal damage which may lead to neurological complications after LT. Nevertheless, preventing the occurrence of overt HE episodes is critical for reducing the risk of irreversible neuronal injury in patients with cirrhosis.",brain injury

Patients presenting with alteration of consciousness were enrolled. Initial clinical data of each participant were evaluated by a neurologist to give a provisional diagnosis. Each participant subsequently received advanced investigations and follow-up to conclude the final diagnosis. All diagnoses were classified into a structural or non-structural cause of alteration of consciousness. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid levels of neurofilament light chain were measured. Cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain and other clinical parameters were used to develop logistic regression models. The performance of cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light chain, the neurologist's provisional diagnosis, and the model to predict the final diagnosis were compared. For the results, among 71 participants enrolled, 67.6% and 32.4% of their final diagnoses were classified as structural and non-structural, respectively.

Quartet of catastrophe: Bilateral epidural hematoma in both supratentorial and infratentorial compartments - A case report and a novel surgical technique to approach.,"['VikrantYadav', 'NityanandPandey']","Epidural hematoma (EDH) is the most common form of traumatic brain lesion in the posterior fossa. This condition is rapidly fatal if not identified and treated accordingly, due to the proximity of the brain stem. Prompt diagnosis is made by early computed tomography (CT) of the head and emergent evacuation is of utmost importance.
A 28-year-old male presented to the emergency room with complaints of headache and vomiting following a road traffic accident. CT scan revealed EDH around the transverse sinus extending into supratentorial and infratentorial compartment bilaterally. The patient was planned for emergency surgery but relatives did not give consent initially they agreed after 24 h when the patient became unconscious. A midline incision was made and a small infratentorial craniectomy with two burr holes was made bilaterally above the transverse sinus. Excellent recovery was seen following a surgical procedure.

Application and underlying mechanism of acupuncture for the nerve repair after peripheral nerve injury: remodeling of nerve system.,"['YongkeYang', 'ChangRao', 'TianlongYin', 'ShaokangWang', 'HuiyanShi', 'XinYan', 'LiliZhang', 'XianggangMeng', 'WenlongGu', 'YuzhengDu', 'FengHong']","Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is a structural event with harmful consequences worldwide. Due to the limited intrinsic regenerative capacity of the peripheral nerve in adults, neural restoration after PNI is difficult. Neurological remodeling has a crucial effect on the repair of the form and function during the regeneration of the peripheral nerve after the peripheral nerve is injured. Several studies have demonstrated that acupuncture is effective for PNI-induced neurologic deficits, and the potential mechanisms responsible for its effects involve the nervous system remodeling in the process of nerve repair. Moreover, acupuncture promotes neural regeneration and axon sprouting by activating related neurotrophins retrograde transport, such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), N-cadherin, and MicroRNAs. Peripheral nerve injury enhances the perceptual response of the central nervous system to pain, causing central sensitization and accelerating neuronal cell apoptosis. Together with this, the remodeling of synaptic transmission function would worsen pain discomfort. Neuroimaging studies have shown remodeling changes in both gray and white matter after peripheral nerve injury. Acupuncture not only reverses the poor remodeling of the nervous system but also stimulates the release of neurotrophic substances such as nerve growth factors in the nervous system to ameliorate pain and promote the regeneration and repair of nerve fibers. In conclusion, the neurological remodeling at the peripheral and central levels in the process of acupuncture treatment accelerates nerve regeneration and repair. These findings provide novel insights enabling the clinical application of acupuncture in the treatment of PNI.",brain injury

This condition affects the gait pattern, increasing the metabolic cost and risk of falling. Robotics with serious games has shown promising results in the gait rehabilitation context. This paper aims to analyze the effects of using the T-FLEX exoskeleton with (1) Automated Therapy (AT) and (2) Serious Game Therapy (SGT) in two ABI patients. Each participant completed six assisted sessions for each strategy. Results showed that AT increases the user-robot interaction torque by 10% for the first patient and 70% for the second patient, and SGT decreases by 5% for both patients. This way, SGT required the patient to generate torque to execute the ankle movement, while AT did the opposite, resulting in greater device assistance. In the functional assessment, SGT induced variations greater than 50% for the paretic ankle and knee's range of motion (ROM), indicating a potential for motor recovery. Thus, SGT led to improved ankle control and increased gait speed compared to AT. These findings suggest that SGT may be an effective rehabilitation strategy for ABI-related foot drop patients.",brain injury

The size and functionalities of the RHO were first fully tailored to the child's needs. We trained the child and their parent on independently using the RHO before taking it home for a period of two weeks. The use of the RHO improved hand ability. Additionally, the tailoring and training benefited the unimanual capacity (Box and Block Test score +2 after tailoring) and bimanual performance (Assisting Hand Assessment score +4) of the child with PEXO. Further, it increased device acceptance by the child and the parent. The child used PEXO at home for 76 minutes distributed over three days during eating and drinking tasks. Personal and environmental factors caused the moderate use. No adverse events or safety-related issues occurred.

Mechanism and therapeutic potential of targeting cGAS-STING signaling in neurological disorders.,"['YigeHuang', 'BangyanLiu', 'Subhash CSinha', 'SadafAmin', 'LiGan']","DNA sensing is a pivotal component of the innate immune system that is responsible for detecting mislocalized DNA and triggering downstream inflammatory pathways. Among the DNA sensors, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a primary player in detecting cytosolic DNA, including foreign DNA from pathogens and self-DNA released during cellular damage, culminating in a type I interferon (IFN-I) response through stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation. IFN-I cytokines are essential in mediating neuroinflammation, which is widely observed in CNS injury, neurodegeneration, and aging, suggesting an upstream role for the cGAS DNA sensing pathway. In this review, we summarize the latest developments on the cGAS-STING DNA-driven immune response in various neurological diseases and conditions. Our review covers the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cGAS activation and highlights cGAS-STING signaling in various cell types of central and peripheral nervous systems, such as resident brain immune cells, neurons, and glial cells. We then discuss the role of cGAS-STING signaling in different neurodegenerative conditions, including tauopathies, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as aging and senescence. Finally, we lay out the current advancements in research and development of cGAS inhibitors and assess the prospects of targeting cGAS and STING as therapeutic strategies for a wide spectrum of neurological diseases.",brain injury

Lateralized brunt of sleep deprivation on white matter injury in a rat model of Alzheimer's disease.,"['XinMao', 'DingHan', 'WenshengGuo', 'WanningZhang', 'HongqiWang', 'GuitaoZhang', 'NingZhang', 'LiangyunJin', 'BinbinNie', 'HuiLi', 'YizhiSong', 'YanWu', 'LirongChang']","Sleep disturbance is a recognized risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying micro-pathological evidence remains limited. To bridge this gap, we established an amyloid-β oligomers (AβO)-induced rat model of AD and subjected it to intermittent sleep deprivation (SD). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and transmission electron microscopy were employed to assess white matter (WM) integrity and ultrastructural changes in myelin sheaths. Our findings demonstrated that SD exacerbated AβO-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, we found SD aggravated AβO-induced asymmetrical impairments in WM, presenting with reductions in tract integrity observed in commissural fibers and association fasciculi, particularly the right anterior commissure, right corpus callosum, and left cingulum. Ultrastructural changes in myelin sheaths within the hippocampus and corpus callosum further confirmed a lateralized effect. Moreover, SD worsened AβO-induced lateralized disruption of the brain structural network, with impairments in critical nodes of the left hemisphere strongly correlated with cognitive dysfunction. This work represents the first identification of a lateralized impact of SD on the mesoscopic network and cognitive deficits in an AD rat model. These findings could deepen our understanding of the complex interplay between sleep disturbance and AD pathology, providing valuable insights into the early progression of the disease, as well as the development of neuroimaging biomarkers for screening early AD patients with self-reported sleep disturbances. Enhanced understanding of these mechanisms may pave the way for targeted interventions to alleviate cognitive decline and improve the quality of life for individuals at risk of or affected by AD. a AβO injection and sleep deprivation were conducted on adult rats. b Sleep deprivation and AβO-induced neurotoxicity aggravated cognitive disability with a synergistic effect. c Sleep deprivation and AβO-induced neurotoxicity reduced the integrity of specific association fasciculi and commissural fibers with ultrastructural demyelination. d On the basis of white matter integrity destruction, the structural connection was disrupted. The exacerbated topological properties with lateralized effects were correlated with cognitive decline.",brain injury
Early qualitative and quantitative amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram and raw electroencephalogram for predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in extremely preterm infants in the Netherlands: a 10-year cohort study.,"['XiaowanWang', 'ChiaraTrabatti', 'LaurenWeeke', 'JeroenDudink', 'HenrietteSwanenburg de Veye', 'Rian M J CEijsermans', 'CorineKoopman-Esseboom', 'Manon J N LBenders', 'Maria LuisaTataranno']","Extremely preterm infants (<28 weeks of gestation) are at great risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairments. Early amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) accompanied by raw EEG traces (aEEG-EEG) has potential for predicting subsequent outcomes in preterm infants. We aimed to determine whether and which qualitative and quantitative aEEG-EEG features obtained within the first postnatal days predict neurodevelopmental outcomes in extremely preterm infants.
This study retrospectively analysed a cohort of extremely preterm infants (born before 28 weeks and 0 days of gestation) who underwent continuous two-channel aEEG-EEG monitoring during their first 3 postnatal days at Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, Utrecht, the Netherlands, between June 1, 2008, and Sept 30, 2018. Only infants who did not have genetic or metabolic diseases or major congenital malformations were eligible for inclusion. Features were extracted from preprocessed aEEG-EEG signals, comprising qualitative parameters grouped in three types (background pattern, sleep-wake cycling, and seizure activity) and quantitative metrics grouped in four categories (spectral content, amplitude, connectivity, and discontinuity). Machine learning-based regression and classification models were used to evaluate the predictive value of the extracted aEEG-EEG features for 13 outcomes, including cognitive, motor, and behavioural problem outcomes, at 2-3 years and 5-7 years. Potential confounders (gestational age at birth, maternal education, illness severity, morphine cumulative dose, the presence of severe brain injury, and the administration of antiseizure, sedative, or anaesthetic medications) were controlled for in all prediction analyses.
369 infants were included and an extensive set of 339 aEEG-EEG features was extracted, comprising nine qualitative parameters and 330 quantitative metrics. The machine learning-based regression models showed significant but relatively weak predictive performance (ranging from r=0·13 to r=0·23) for nine of 13 outcomes. However, the machine learning-based classifiers exhibited acceptable performance in identifying infants with intellectual impairments from those with optimal outcomes at age 5-7 years, achieving balanced accuracies of 0·77 (95% CI 0·62-0·90; p=0·0020) for full-scale intelligence quotient score and 0·81 (0·65-0·96; p=0·0010) for verbal intelligence quotient score. Both classifiers maintained identical performance when solely using quantitative features, achieving balanced accuracies of 0·77 (95% CI 0·63-0·91; p=0·0030) for full-scale intelligence quotient score and 0·81 (0·65-0·96; p=0·0010) for verbal intelligence quotient score.
These findings highlight the potential benefits of using early postnatal aEEG-EEG features to automatically recognise extremely preterm infants with poor outcomes, facilitating the development of an interpretable prognostic tool that aids in decision making and therapy planning.

The peripheral nervous system has immense potential for regeneration extensively due to the innate plastic potential of Schwann cells (SCs) that allows SCs to interact with the injured axons and exert specific repair functions essential for peripheral nerve regeneration. In this study, we show that EBP50 is essential for the repair function of SCs and regeneration following nerve injury. The increased expression of EBP50 in the injured sciatic nerve of control mice suggested a significant role in regeneration. The ablation of EBP50 in mice resulted in delayed nerve repair, recovery of behavioral function, and remyelination following nerve injury. EBP50 deficiency led to deficits in SC functions, including proliferation, migration, cytoskeleton dynamics, and axon interactions. The adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated local expression of EBP50 improved SCs migration, functional recovery, and remyelination. ErbB2-related proteins were not differentially expressed in EBP50-deficient sciatic nerves following injury. EBP50 binds and stabilizes ErbB2 and activates the repair functions to promote regeneration. Thus, we identified EBP50 as a potent SC protein that can enhance the regeneration and functional recovery driven by NRG1-ErbB2 signaling, as well as a novel regeneration modulator capable of potential therapeutic effects.",brain injury

Herein, we focus on interactions between D2R and NR2B in morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) and hyperlocomotion mice models. We found that the D2R-NR2B complex significantly increases in morphine-induced mice models, accompanied by ERK signaling impairment, implying the complex could contribute to the morphine addiction pathophysiological process. Further, we design a brain-penetrant interfering peptide (TAT-D2-KT), which could disrupt interactions of D2R-NR2B and decrease addictive-like behaviors concurrent to ERK signaling improvement. In summary, our data provided the first evidence for a D2R-NMDAR complex formation in morphine use disorders and its underlying mechanism of ERK signaling, which could present a novel therapeutic target with direct implications for morphine acquisition and relapse treatment.",brain injury
Astrocytes and microglia-targeted Danshensu liposomes enhance the therapeutic effects on cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.,"['MinBai', 'NaCui', 'YuchengLiao', 'ChaoGuo', 'LiangLi', 'YingYin', 'AidongWen', 'JingwenWang', 'WeiliangYe', 'YiDing']","Cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (CI/RI) is the main cause of disability and death in stroke without satisfactory therapeutic effect. Inflammation mediated by activation of astrocytes and microglia is the main pathological mechanism of CI/RI. Danshensu (DSS) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects against brain injury. However, limited by its poor cellular permeability and low bioavailability, it is still needed the new DSS preparations with the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and target inflammatory glial cells. In this study, we developed phosphatidylserine (PS) and transferrin (TF) modified liposomes carrying DSS (TF/PS/DSS-LPs) to improve the therapeutic efficacy against ischemic stroke. First, TF molecules targeted transferrin receptor (TfR) that is overexpressed in the BBB. Following the liposomes enter the brain, PS modification allowed the liposomes to target and bind to the overexpressed phosphatidylserine-specific receptors (PSRs) on the surface of astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, it enhanced the uptake of TF/PS/DSS-LPs by astrocytes and microglia, while polarizing astrocytes from A1 to A2 and microglia from M1 to M2, reducing neuronal inflammation, and ultimately ameliorating cerebral ischemic injury. Thus, TF/PS/DSS-LPs could potentially serve as a promising strategy for the CI/RI treatment.",brain injury
Enhanced Nose-to-Brain Delivery of Combined Small Interfering RNAs Using Lesion-Recognizing Nanoparticles for the Synergistic Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease.,"['JiaxinLi', 'HuanPeng', 'WenZhang', 'MuziLi', 'NanWang', 'ChenPeng', 'XinyueZhang', 'YanLi']","Gene therapy has great potential in treating neurodegenerative diseases with complex pathologies. The combination of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and caspase-3 will provide an effective treatment option for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To overcome the multiple physiological barriers and improve the therapeutic efficacy of siRNAs, lesion-recognizing nanoparticles (NPs) are constructed in this study for the synergistic treatment of AD. The lesion-recognizing NPs contain rabies virus glycoprotein peptide-modified mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as the shell and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive polymer loaded with siRNAs as the core. After intranasal administration, the lesion-recognizing NPs cross the nasal mucosa and migrate to the affected brain areas. Furthermore, the NPs recognize the target cells and fuse with the cell membranes of neurons. The cores of NPs directly enter into the cytoplasm and achieve the controlled release of siRNAs in a high-ROS environment to downregulate the level of BACE1 and caspase-3 to ameliorate neurologic injury. In addition, lesion-recognizing NPs can significantly reduce the number of reactive astrocytes. Lesion-recognizing NPs have a positive effect on regulating the phase of neurons and astrocytes, which results in better restoration of memory deficits in 3 × Tg-AD mice. Therefore, this work provides a promising platform for neurodegenerative disease treatment.",brain injury
Intrathecal production of anti-EBV Viral Capsid Antigen IgG is associated with Neurocognition and tau pathology in people with HIV.,"['MattiaTrunfio', 'AlessandraSacchi', 'DanielaVai', 'FabriziaPittaluga', 'MicheleCroce', 'RossanaCavallo', 'DanieleImperiale', 'StefanoBonora', 'GiovanniDi Perri', 'Scott LeeLetendre', 'AndreaCalcagno']","HIV and EBV co-infection has been linked to increased immune activation and larger HIV reservoir. We assessed whether anti-EBV humoral responses are associated with increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammation and with neurocognitive impairment (NCI) in people with HIV (PWH).
Cross-sectional analysis in 123 EBV-seropositive PWH either on antiretroviral therapy (n = 70) or not.
Serum and CSF anti-EBV Viral Capsid Antigen Immunoglobulin G (anti-EVI) and CSF EBV DNA were measured by commercial immunoassay and RT-PCR. Seventy-eight participants without neurological confounding factors underwent neurocognitive assessment (Global Deficit Score, GDS). CSF total tau and 181-phosphorylated-tau (ptau) were measured by immunoassays together with biomarkers of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, immune activation, astrocytosis, and intrathecal synthesis. Logistic and linear regressions and moderation analysis were used to investigate the relationships between CSF anti-EVI, GDS, and biomarkers.
Twenty-one (17.1%) and twenty-two participants (17.9%) had detectable CSF anti-EVI (10.5-416.0 U/mL) and CSF EBV DNA (25-971 cp/mL). After adjusting for BBB integrity, age, and clinical factors, the presence of CSF anti-EVI was only associated with serum levels of anti-EVI, and not with CSF EBV DNA. CSF anti-EVI and tau and ptau showed reciprocal interactions affecting their associations with GDS. After adjusting for demographics and clinical parameters, higher CSF anti-EVI levels were associated with worse GDS (aβ 0.45, p < 0.001), and CSF levels of tau and ptau had moderate the strength of this association (models'p < 0.001).

Recombinant human erythropoietin protects against immature brain damage induced by hypoxic/ischemia insult.,"['ZhengdaSun', 'JiqingSong', 'QijunSong', 'LinLi', 'XinxinTian', 'LijunWang']","To investigate the neuroprotection of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) against hypoxic/ischemic (HI) insult in three-day-old rats. Postnatal day 3 (PD3) rats were randomly divided into three groups: Sham group, HI group and HI+rhEPO group. Ligation of the right common carotid artery and hypoxia to induce HI brain injury. After HI insult, the rats received intraperitoneal injection of rhEPO (5000 IU/Kg, qod) in HI+rhEPO group or equal saline in other groups. On PD10, damage of brain tissue was examined by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, observation of neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and cortex using immunofluorescence assay (marker: TUNEL). Immunohistochemical staining or western blotting was performed to detect the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Caspase-3 and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) protein. On PD28, cognitive ability of rats was assessed by Morris water maze test. HI injury causes brain pathological morphology and cognitive function damage in PD3 rats, which can be alleviated by rhEPO intervention. Compared with the HI group, the HI+rhEPO group showed an increase in platform discovery rate and cross platform frequency, while the search platform time was shortened (P < 0.05). The proportion of TUNEL positive neurons and the expression of COX-2 and Caspase-3 proteins in brain tissue in the hippocampus and cortex was decreased, while the expression of p-Akt protein was upregulated (P < 0.05). RhEPO could protect against the pathological and cognitive impairment of immature brain induced by HI insult. This neuroprotective activity may involve in inhibiting inflammatory and apoptosis by activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.",brain injury
Patterns and Transitions of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury Outcome Expectancies and Their Associations with Nonsuicidal Self-Injury among Adolescents.,"['JiaqiGuo', 'ChuhanWang', 'JianingYou']","Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) outcome expectancies (i.e., the expectations that certain outcomes will follow NSSI) have been confirmed to predict NSSI engagement. However, it remains unclear whether adolescents hold different patterns of NSSI outcome expectancies and therefore vary in their risks of NSSI engagement. Moreover, little is known about whether patterns transition over time, influencing the development of NSSI. Additionally, possible gender differences in the patterns and their transitions need to be explored. This study aims to address these research gaps.

Differences in Cortical Activation During Dorsiflexion and Plantarflexion in Chronic Ankle Instability: A Task-fMRI Study.,"['YajieLi', 'ZhifengWang', 'YiyuanShen', 'YangYang', 'XuWang', 'HanqiuLiu', 'WeiweiWang']","Chronic ankle instability is a common sports injury that often presents with increased plantarflexion and restricted dorsiflexion. The cumulative effect of peripheral injuries may induce neuroplasticity in the central nervous system. However, the relationship between dorsiflexion or plantarflexion and the central nervous system in patients with chronic ankle instability remains unknown.
(1) Is there a difference in region and voxel (volume pixel) of cortical activation during plantarflexion and dorsiflexion between patients with chronic ankle instability and a control group with normal ankle function? (2) Is there a correlation between activation of sensorimotor-related brain regions and three clinical measurement scales of ankle function and disease severity in patients with chronic ankle instability?
Between December 2020 and May 2022, we treated 400 patients who had chronic ankle instability. Ten percent (40 patients; mean ± standard deviation age 29 ± 7 years; 17 male patients) were randomly selected to participate in this study. We recruited 42 volunteers with normal ankle function (mean age 28 ± 5 years; 21 male participants) matched by age and education level. A total of 2.5% (1 of 40) of patients with bilateral chronic ankle instability and 30% (12 of 40) with left-sided chronic ankle injury did not meet our inclusion criteria and were excluded from the study. The control group underwent MRI with good image quality. Finally, 27 patients with chronic ankle instability (mean age 26 ± 5 years; 10 male patients) and 42 participants with normal ankle function were enrolled. Ankle function and disease severity were assessed using three clinical scales: the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool, Karlsson-Peterson Ankle Function Score, and the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score. A uniplanar and nonweightbearing ankle dorsiflexion-plantarflexion paradigm (a recognized model or pattern) was performed using a short-block design during the functional MRI scan. This experimental design included a series of on-off periods consisting of movement and a rest period. From 15° of plantarflexion to 15° of dorsiflexion, the manipulator allowed 30° of ankle rotation. The cerebral excitability patterns between patients with chronic ankle instability and controls were analyzed using t-tests. We retained voxels with p values less than 0.05 in a voxel-level family-wise error correction. Clusters with voxel numbers greater than 10 were retained. The Cohen d coefficient was used to calculate between-group effect sizes. Spearman analysis was performed to explore the correlation between activation regions and the three clinical assessment scales.
In the patient group, cortical activation was greater during plantarflexion than during dorsiflexion, which was different from that in the control group. The between-group comparison showed that patients with chronic ankle instability had reduced activation in the ipsilateral precuneus (cluster size = 35 voxels [95% CI -0.23 to 0.07]; p < 0.001) during dorsiflexion, whereas during plantarflexion, chronic ankle instability caused increased activation in the ipsilateral superior temporal gyrus (cluster size = 90 voxels [95% CI -0.73 to -0.13]; p < 0.001), precuneus (cluster size = 18 voxels [95% CI -0.56 to -0.19]; p < 0.001), supplementary motor area (cluster size = 57 voxels [95% CI -0.31 to 0.00]; p < 0.001), superior frontal gyrus (cluster size = 43 voxels [95% CI -0.82 to -0.29]; p < 0.001), medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (cluster size = 39 voxels [95% CI 0.41 to 0.78]; p < 0.001), and contralateral postcentral gyrus (cluster size = 100 voxels [95% CI -0.32 to 0.02]; p < 0.001). Patients with chronic ankle instability showed a large effect size compared with controls (Cohen d > 0.8). During plantarflexion, the number of activated voxels in the supplementary motor area had a modest, positive correlation with the Karlsson-Peterson Ankle Function Score (r = 0.52; p = 0.01), and the number of activated voxels in the primary motor cortex (M1) and primary sensory cortex (S1) had a weak, positive correlation with the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society Score in patients with chronic ankle instability (M1: r = 0.45; p = 0.02, S1: r = 0.49; p = 0.01).
Compared with volunteers with normal ankle function, patients with chronic ankle instability had increased cortical activation during plantarflexion and decreased cortical activation during dorsiflexion. We analyzed the central neural mechanisms of chronic ankle instability in patients with sports injuries and provided a theoretical basis for the development of new central and peripheral interventions in the future.
Because there was a positive correlation between the neural activity in sensorimotor-related regions during plantarflexion and clinical severity, clinicians might one day be able to help patients who have chronic ankle instability with neuromuscular rehabilitation by applying electrical stimulation to specific targets (such as S1M1 and the supplementary motor area) or by increasing activation of sensorimotor neurons through ankle movement.",brain injury
Impaired cortical neuronal homeostasis and cognition after diffuse traumatic brain injury are dependent on microglia and type I interferon responses.,"['Jonathan MPacker', 'Chelsea EBray', 'Nicolas BBeckman', 'Lynde MWangler', 'Amara CDavis', 'Ethan JGoodman', 'Nathaniel EKlingele', 'Jonathan PGodbout']","Neuropsychiatric complications including depression and cognitive decline develop in the years after traumatic brain injury (TBI), negatively affecting quality of life. Microglial and type 1 interferon (IFN-I) responses are associated with the transition from acute to chronic neuroinflammation after diffuse TBI in mice. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if impaired neuronal homeostasis and increased IFN-I responses intersected after TBI to cause cognitive impairment. Here, the RNA profile of neurons and microglia after TBI (single nucleus RNA-sequencing) with or without microglia depletion (CSF1R antagonist) was assessed 7 dpi. There was a TBI-dependent suppression of cortical neuronal homeostasis with reductions in CREB signaling, synaptogenesis, and synaptic migration and increases in RhoGDI and PTEN signaling (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis). Microglial depletion reversed 50% of TBI-induced gene changes in cortical neurons depending on subtype. Moreover, the microglial RNA signature 7 dpi was associated with increased stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation and IFN-I responses. Therefore, we sought to reduce IFN-I signaling after TBI using STING knockout mice and a STING antagonist, chloroquine (CQ). TBI-associated cognitive deficits in novel object location and recognition (NOL/NOR) tasks at 7 and 30 dpi were STING dependent. In addition, TBI-induced STING expression, microglial morphological restructuring, inflammatory (Tnf, Cd68, Ccl2) and IFN-related (Irf3, Irf7, Ifi27) gene expression in the cortex were attenuated in STING",brain injury
Higher regional grey matter volume and white matter integrity in individuals with central neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury.,"['AbigailLivny', 'YaelGolan', 'NofarItzhaki', 'DafnaGrosberg', 'GaliaTsarfaty', 'MosheBondi', 'GabiZeilig', 'RuthDefrin']","Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating neurological condition that often leads to central neuropathic pain (CNP). As the fundamental mechanism of CNP is not fully established, its management is one of the most challenging problems among people with SCI. In order to shed more light on CNP mechanisms, the aim of the current study was to compare the brain structure between individuals with SCI and CNP and those without CNP by examining the grey-matter volume and the white-matter integrity. Fifty-two individuals with SCI; 28 with CNP and 24 without CNP, underwent an MRI session, including a T1-weighted scan for voxel-based morphometry, and a diffusion-weighted imaging scan for white-matter integrity analysis, as measured by fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity. We found significantly higher grey-matter volume in individuals with CNP compared to pain free individuals in the right superior (p<0.0014) and middle temporal gyri (p<0.0001). Moreover, individuals with CNP exhibited higher white-matter integrity in the splenium of the corpus callosum (p<0.0001) and in the posterior cingulum (p<0.0001), compared to pain free individuals. The results suggest that the existence of CNP following SCI is associated with grey-matter and white-matter structural abnormalities in regions involved in pain intensification and spread, and which may reflect maladaptive neural plasticity in CNP.",brain injury
Ferroptosis contributes to hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia‑induced brain damage in vivo and in vitro.,"['JinfuZhou', 'XinpeiLin', 'SiningLiao', 'GuilinLi', 'JianpingTang', 'JinyingLuo', 'ChenranZhang', 'SiyingWu', 'LiangpuXu', 'HuangyuanLi']","Ferroptosis is driven by iron‑dependent accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides, and hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia causes accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin and iron. The present study aimed to assess the role of ferroptosis in hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia‑induced brain damage (HHIBD). Rats were randomly divided into the control, phenylhydrazine (PHZ) and deferoxamine (DFO) + PHZ groups, with 12 rats in each group. Ferroptosis‑associated biochemical and protein indicators were measured in the brain tissue of rats. We also performed tandem mass tag‑labeled proteomic analysis. The levels of iron and malondialdehyde were significantly higher and levels of glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase activity significantly lower in the brain tissues of the PHZ group compared with those in the control group. HHIBD also resulted in significant increases in the expression of the ferroptosis‑related proteins acyl‑CoA synthetase long‑chain family member 4, ferritin heavy chain 1 and transferrin receptor and divalent metal transporter 1, as well as a significant reduction in the expression of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the differentially expressed proteins of rat brain tissues between the control and PHZ groups were significantly involved in ferroptosis, GSH metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis pathways. Pretreatment with DFO induced antioxidant activity and alleviated lipid peroxidation‑mediated HHIBD. In addition, PC12 cells treated with ferric ammonium citrate showed shrinking mitochondria, high mitochondrial membrane density, and increased lipid reactive oxygen species and intracellular ferrous iron, which were antagonized by pretreatment with ferrostatin‑1 or DFO, which was reversed by pretreatment with ferrostatin‑1 or DFO. The present study demonstrated that ferroptosis is involved in HHIBD and provided novel insights into candidate proteins that are potentially involved in ferroptosis in the brain during hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia.",brain injury
"The relationship between cognition and white matter tract damage after mild traumatic brain injury in a premorbidly healthy, hospitalised adult cohort during the post-acute period.","['Jacqueline F IAnderson', 'Lucy EOehr', 'JianChen', 'Jerome JMaller', 'Marc LSeal', 'Joseph Yuan-MouYang']","Recent developments in neuroimaging techniques enable increasingly sensitive consideration of the cognitive impact of damage to white matter tract (WMT) microstructural organisation after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).
This study investigated the relationship between WMT microstructural properties and cognitive performance.
Using an observational design, a group of 26 premorbidly healthy adults with mTBI and a group of 20 premorbidly healthy trauma control (TC) participants who were well-matched on age, sex, premorbid functioning and a range of physical, psychological and trauma-related variables, were recruited following hospital admission for traumatic injury.
All participants underwent comprehensive unblinded neuropsychological examination and structural neuroimaging as outpatients 6-10 weeks after injury. Neuropsychological examination included measures of speed of processing, attention, memory, executive function, affective state, pain, fatigue and self-reported outcome. The WMT microstructural properties were estimated using both diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) modelling techniques. Tract properties were compared between the corpus callosum, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, uncinate fasciculus, anterior corona radiata and three segmented sections of the superior longitudinal fasciculus.
For the TC group, in all investigated tracts, with the exception of the uncinate fasciculus, two DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy and apparent diffusion coefficient) and one NODDI metric (intra-cellular volume fraction) revealed expected predictive linear relationships between extent of WMT microstructural organisation and processing speed, memory and executive function. The mTBI group showed a strikingly different pattern relative to the TC group, with no relationships evident between WMT microstructural organisation and cognition on most tracts.
These findings indicate that the predictive relationship that normally exists in adults between WMT microstructural organisation and cognition, is significantly disrupted 6-10 weeks after mTBI and suggests that WMT microstructural organisation and cognitive function have disparate recovery trajectories.",brain injury

Astrogliosis in multiple sclerosis and neuro-inflammation: what role for the notch pathway?,"['PierreMora', 'CandiceChapouly']","Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central nervous system leading to neurodegeneration. It affects 2.3 million people worldwide, generally younger than 50. There is no known cure for the disease, and current treatment options - mainly immunotherapies to limit disease progression - are few and associated with serious side effects. In multiple sclerosis, disruption of the blood-brain barrier is an early event in the pathogenesis of lesions, predisposing to edema, excito-toxicity and inflammatory infiltration into the central nervous system. Recently, the vision of the blood brain barrier structure and integrity has changed and include contributions from all components of the neurovascular unit, among which astrocytes. During neuro-inflammation, astrocytes become reactive. They undergo morphological and molecular changes named ""astrogliosis"" driving the conversion from acute inflammatory injury to a chronic neurodegenerative state. Astrogliosis mechanisms are minimally explored despite their significance in regulating the autoimmune response during multiple sclerosis. Therefore, in this review, we take stock of the state of knowledge regarding astrogliosis in neuro-inflammation and highlight the central role of NOTCH signaling in the process of astrocyte reactivity. Indeed, a very detailed nomenclature published in nature neurosciences in 2021, listing all the reactive astrocyte markers fully identified in the literature, doesn't cover the NOTCH signaling. Hence, we discuss evidence supporting NOTCH1 receptor as a central regulator of astrogliosis in the pathophysiology of neuro-inflammation, notably multiple sclerosis, in human and experimental models.",brain injury

Intracranial Hypertension with Patent Basal Cisterns: Controlled Lumbar Drainage as a Therapeutic Option. Selected Case Series.,"['PedroGrille', 'AlbertoBiestro', 'Harold LRekate']","There are pathological conditions in which intracranial hypertension and patent basal cisterns in computed tomography coexist. These situations are not well recognized, which could lead to diagnostic errors and improper management.
We present a retrospective case series of patients with traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cryptococcal meningitis who were treated at our intensive care unit. Criteria for deciding placement of an external lumbar drain were (1) intracranial hypertension refractory to osmotherapy, hyperventilation, neuromuscular blockade, intravenous anesthesia, and, in some cases, decompressive craniectomy and (2) a computed tomography scan that showed open basal cisterns and no mass lesion.
Eleven patients were studied. Six of the eleven patients treated with controlled lumbar drainage are discussed as illustrative cases. All patients developed intracranial hypertension refractory to maximum medical treatment, including decompressive craniectomy in Four of the eleven cases. Controlled external lumbar drainage led to immediate and sustained control of elevated intracranial pressure in all patients, with good neurological outcomes. No brain herniation, intracranial bleeding, or meningitis was detected during this procedure.
Our study provides preliminary evidence that in selected patients who develop refractory intracranial hypertension with patent basal cisterns and no focal mass effect on computed tomography, controlled lumbar drainage appears to be a therapeutic option. In our study there were no deaths or complications. Prospective and larger studies are needed to confirm our results.",brain injury
Involvement of PI3K/AKT Pathway in the Rapid Antidepressant Effects of Crocetin in Mice with Depression-Like Phenotypes.,"['SusuLin', 'ZiweiChen', 'ZhaorunchengWu', 'FeiFei', 'ZijinXu', 'YingpengTong', 'WenyuSun', 'PingWang']","The current first-line antidepressants have the drawback of slow onset, which greatly affects the treatment of depression. Crocetin, one of the main active ingredients in saffron (Crocus sativus L.), has been demonstrated to have antidepressant activities, but whether it has a rapid antidepressant effect remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the onset, duration, and mechanisms of the rapid antidepressant activity of crocetin (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) in male mice subjected to chronic restraint stress (CRS). The results of behavioral tests showed that crocetin exerted rapid antidepressant-like effect in mice with depression-like phenotypes, including rapid normalization of depressive-like behaviors within 3 h, and the effects could be maintained for 2 days. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Nissl staining showed that crocetin ameliorated hippocampal neuroinflammation and nerve injuries in mice with depression-like phenotypes. The levels of inflammatory factors, corticosterone and pro brain-derived neurotrophic factor in crocetin-administrated mice serum were significantly reduced compared with those in the CRS group, as well as the levels of inflammatory factors in hippocampus. What's more, Western blot analyses showed that, compared to CRS-induced mice, the relative levels of mitogen-activated kinase phosphatase 1 and toll-like receptor 4 were significantly reduced after the administration of crocetin, and the relative expressions of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), cAMP-response element binding protein, phosphorylated phosphoinositide 3 kinase (p-PI3K)/PI3K, phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-AKT)/AKT, phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3β (p-GSK3β)/GSK3β, phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (p-mTOR)/mTOR were markedly upregulated. In conclusion, crocetin exerted rapid antidepressant effects via suppressing the expression of inflammatory cytokines and the apoptosis of neuronal cells through PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. The rapid antidepressant effect of crocetin (40 mg/kg) could be maintained for at least 2 days after single treatment.",brain injury
Serum Angiopoietin-2 level increase differs between polytraumatized patients with and without central nervous system injuries.,"['Lukas LNegrin', 'StefanHajdu']","Since endothelial cells rapidly release Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) in response to vascular injury and inflammatory stimuli, we aimed to investigate if its serum levels increase in polytraumatized patients. Our cohort study evaluated 28 blunt polytrauma survivors (mean age, 38.4 years; median ISS, 34) who were directly admitted to our level I trauma center in 2018. We assessed the serum Ang-2 level at admission and on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 during hospitalization. Ang-2 was released into the circulation immediately after polytrauma. At admission (day 0), it amounted to 8286 ± 5068 pg/mL, three-and-a-half times the reference value of 2337 ± 650 pg/mL assessed in a healthy control group. Subgroup analysis provided a higher mean Ang-2 level in the CNSI group combining all patients suffering a brain or spinal cord injury compared to the non-CNSI group solely on day 0 [11083 ± 5408 pg/mL versus 3963 ± 2062 pg/mL; p < 0.001]. Whereas the mean Ang-2 level increased only in the non-CNSI group from day 0 to day 3 (p = 0.009), the respective curves showed similar continuous decreases starting with day 3. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the Ang-2 day 0 level and the presence of a CNSI (OR = 1.885; p = 0.048). ROC analysis provided a cutoff level of 5352 pg/mL. In our study group, serum Ang-2 levels assessed at admission differed between polytraumatized patients with and without brain or spinal cord injuries. Based on our findings, we consider serum Ang-2 levels an effective biomarker candidate for indicating CNSI in these patients at admission, worthy of further evaluation in large multicenter studies.",brain injury
Regulated cell death and inflammasome activation in gut injury following traumatic surgery in vitro and in vivo: implication for postoperative death due to multiorgan dysfunction.,"['LingzhiWu', 'HailinZhao', 'MengxuZhang', 'QizheSun', 'EnqiangChang', 'XinyiLi', 'WenOuyang', 'YuanLe', 'DaqingMa']","Postoperative multi-organ dysfunction (MOD) is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Necroptosis has been implicated in different types of solid organ injury; however, the mechanisms linking necroptosis to inflammation require further elucidation. The present study examines the involvement of necroptosis and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in small intestine injury following traumatic surgery. Kidney transplantation in rats and renal ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) in mice were used as traumatic and laparotomic surgery models to study necroptosis and inflammasome activation in the small intestinal post-surgery; additional groups also received receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) inhibitor necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s). To investigate whether necroptosis regulates inflammasome activity in vitro, necroptosis was induced in human colonic epithelial cancer cells (Caco-2) by a combination of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), SMAC mimetic LCL-161 and pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-Oph (together, TLQ), and necroptosis was blocked by Nec-1s or mixed lineage kinase-domain like (MLKL) inhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA). Renal transplantation and renal ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) upregulated the expression of necroptosis mediators (RIPK1; RIPK3; phosphorylated-MLKL) and inflammasome components (P2X purinoceptor subfamily 7, P2X7R; NLRP3; caspase-1) in the small intestines at 24 h, and Nec-1s suppressed the expression of inflammasome components. TLQ treatment induced NLRP3 inflammasome, promoted cleavage of caspase-1 and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and stimulated extracellular ATP release from Caco-2 cells, and MLKL inhibitor NSA prevented TLQ-induced inflammasome activity and ATP release from Caco-2 cells. Our work suggested that necroptosis and inflammasome interactively promote remote postoperative small intestinal injury, at least in part, through ATP purinergic signalling. Necroptosis-inflammasome axis may be considered as novel therapeutic target for tackling postoperative MOD in the critical care settings.",brain injury

Eighty male rat pups randomly distributed into eight groups. Group I is the control, and Group II is socially engaged rats treated with PUN. Groups III to VII were exposed to ADHD-inducing factors: Group III to SI, Group IV to MSG, and Group V to both SI and MSG. Furthermore, Groups VI to VIII were the same Groups III to V but additionally received PUN treatment.
Exposure to MSG and/or SI led to pronounced behavioral anomalies, histological changes and indicative of ADHD-like symptoms in rat pups which is accompanied by inhibition of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/Heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1)/Glutathione (GSH) pathway, decline of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and activation of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB)/NLR Family Pyrin Domain Containing 3 (NLRP3) pathway. This resulted in elevated inflammatory biomarker levels, neuronal apoptosis, and disrupted neurotransmitter equilibrium. Meanwhile, pretreatment with PUN protected against all the previous alterations.
We established compelling associations between MSG consumption, SI, and ADHD progression. Moreover, we proved that PUN is a promising neuroprotective agent against all risk factors of ADHD.",brain injury
3-Methylglutarylcarnitine: A biomarker of mitochondrial dysfunction.,"['Elizabeth AJennings', 'Zane HAbi-Rached', 'Dylan EJones', 'Robert ORyan']","The acylcarnitines comprise a wide range of acyl groups linked via an ester bond to the hydroxyl group of L-carnitine. Mass spectrometry methods are capable of measuring the relative abundance of hundreds of acylcarnitines in a single drop of blood. As such, acylcarnitines can serve as sensitive biomarkers of disease. For certain acylcarnitines, however, their biochemical origin, and biomedical significance, remain unclear. One such example is 3-methylglutaryl (3MG) carnitine (C5-3M-DC). Whereas 3MG carnitine levels are normally very low, elevated levels are detected in discrete inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) as well as different forms of heart disease. Moreover, acute injury, including γ radiation exposure, paraquat poisoning, and traumatic brain injury manifest elevated levels of 3MG carnitine in blood and/or urine. Recent evidence indicates that two distinct biosynthetic routes to 3MG carnitine exist. The first, caused by an inherited deficiency in the leucine catabolism pathway enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA lyase, leads to a buildup of trans-3-methylglutaconyl (3MGC) CoA. Reduction of the double bond in trans-3MGC CoA generates 3MG CoA, which is then converted to 3MG carnitine by carnitine acyltransferase. This route, however, cannot explain why 3MG carnitine levels increase in IEMs that do not affect leucine metabolism or various chronic and acute disease states. In these cases, disease-related defects in aerobic energy metabolism result in diversion of acetyl CoA to trans-3MGC CoA. Once formed, trans-3MGC CoA is reduced to 3MG CoA and esterified to form 3MG carnitine. Thus, 3MG carnitine, represents a potential biomarker of disease processes associated with compromised mitochondrial energy metabolism.",brain injury
Radioprotective effect of Ginkgolide B on brain: the mediating role of DCC/MST1 signaling.,"['TaoYang', 'XiaoDu', 'LixingXu']","The risk of brain exposure to ionizing radiation increases gradually due to the extensive application of nuclear technology in medical, industrial, and aerospace fields. Radiation-induced brain injury (RBI) is highly likely to cause a wide range of neurological complications, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), depression. Ginkgolide B (GB) is one of the effective active components extracted from ginkgo biloba leaves, exerts protective effects on CNS, which is involved in the regulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. MST1, as one of the core kinases of the Hippo pathway, participated in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, it remains unclear whether GB attenuates radiation brain injury (RBI) and whether the radioprotective effect of GB refers to MST1 signaling. Hence, our study aimed to explore the radiation protection effect and the potential mechanism of GB.
C57BL/6 mice were stimulated with an X-ray (20 Gy) to establish an RBI model. Then, morris water maze test (MWM) and step-down passive avoidance test (SDPAT) were used to assess the learning and memory function of mice. The open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), and forced swimming test (FST) were used to assess changes in locomotor activity and hopelessness. Besides, X-ray-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells were used to verify the radioprotective effect of GB. Immunofluorescence double staining, Dihydroethidium (DHE), western blot, and flow cytometry were used to explore the role of DCC/MST1 signaling in RBI.
In this study, X-ray-treated mice exhibited cognitive impairment and depression-like behavior, which was ameliorated by GB treatment. GB also reduced the ROS production and the number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus. Moreover, GB increased the protein levels of p-AKT and Bcl2, while decreased the protein levels of MST1, p-p38, p-JNK, cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, exogenous Netrin-1 alleviated X-ray-induced ROS production and apoptosis, whereas knockout of Netrin-1 receptor DCC abolished the protective effect of GB.
Oxidative stress and MST1-mediated neuronal apoptosis participated in radiation-induced cognitive impairment and depression-like behaviors, and modulation of DCC by GB was an effective intervention against RBI.",brain injury
A Biomimic Nanobullet with Ameliorative Inflammatory Microenvironment for Alzheimer's Disease Treatments.,"['YanyueWu', 'JunYang', 'YiwanGeng', 'XiyueJiao', 'ZhiguoLu', 'TianluZhang', 'RuichenZhao', 'JingGuo', 'WenliWang', 'JingWang', 'XinZhang']","Aβ oligomers, formed prior to diagnostic marker-amyloid β (Aβ) plaques, can damage neurons and trigger neuroinflammation, which accelerate the neuronal injury in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Herein, the combination of eliminating the Aβ oligomers and alleviating the inflammation is a promising therapeutic strategy for AD. However, the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the intrinsic deficiencies of the drugs severely restrict their therapeutic effects. Inspired by the properties of rabies virus, a biomimic nanobullet (PBACR@NRs/SA) targeting neurons has been developed. The biomimic nanobullets possess the BBB penetrating character based on iron oxide nanorods; it can sequentially release rosmarinic acid and small interfering RNA targeting NF-κB triggered by microenvironment, which improve the microenvironment inflammation and realize the cure for AD. Compared with non-biomimic systems, the biomimic nanobullets exhibit a less caveolin-dependent internalization pathway, which reduces ROS production and mitochondrial fission in neurons. Therefore, the biomimic nanobullet is hopeful for the treatment of ADs and provides a promising platform for other brain diseases' treatments.",brain injury
Diet-induced glial insulin resistance impairs the clearance of neuronal debris in Drosophila brain.,"['MrojAlassaf', 'AkhilaRajan']","Obesity significantly increases the risk of developing neurodegenerative disorders, yet the precise mechanisms underlying this connection remain unclear. Defects in glial phagocytic function are a key feature of neurodegenerative disorders, as delayed clearance of neuronal debris can result in inflammation, neuronal death, and poor nervous system recovery. Mounting evidence indicates that glial function can affect feeding behavior, weight, and systemic metabolism, suggesting that diet may play a role in regulating glial function. While it is appreciated that glial cells are insulin sensitive, whether obesogenic diets can induce glial insulin resistance and thereby impair glial phagocytic function remains unknown. Here, using a Drosophila model, we show that a chronic obesogenic diet induces glial insulin resistance and impairs the clearance of neuronal debris. Specifically, obesogenic diet exposure down-regulates the basal and injury-induced expression of the glia-associated phagocytic receptor, Draper. Constitutive activation of systemic insulin release from Drosophila insulin-producing cells (IPCs) mimics the effect of diet-induced obesity on glial Draper expression. In contrast, genetically attenuating systemic insulin release from the IPCs rescues diet-induced glial insulin resistance and Draper expression. Significantly, we show that genetically stimulating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Pi3k), a downstream effector of insulin receptor (IR) signaling, rescues high-sugar diet (HSD)-induced glial defects. Hence, we establish that obesogenic diets impair glial phagocytic function and delays the clearance of neuronal debris.",brain injury

Medication for OUD such as methadone and buprenorphine are treatments for OUD, yet psychosis introduces additional challenges in retaining patients in care. Extended-release depot buprenorphine is an emerging option for the treatment of moderate-to-severe OUD, and it may provide certain benefits in patients with concurrent OUD and psychosis. We present the case of a 32-year-old man with schizophrenia, traumatic brain injury, and OUD with a history of multiple opioid-related overdoses, followed by an assertive community treatment team, and subject to a community treatment order for both his primary psychotic disorder and OUD treatments. We discuss the role of extended-release depot buprenorphine in this unique patient population and the ethical considerations of involuntary treatment of OUD in patients lacking capacity to consent to treatment.",brain injury
Competitive binding of circCCDC6 to microRNA-128-3p activates TXNIP/NLRP3 pathway and promotes cerebral ischemia-reperfusion defects.,"['ChongShuWang', 'MingMingDong', 'XiaoYiZhang', 'XiaoYuWang', 'YanZhao', 'YunpengCao']","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are enriched in the brain and involved in various central nervous system diseases. The potential role of circCCDC6 in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion defects was partly elucidated in the work.
A middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) rat model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation and re-oxygenation (OGD/R)-treated SH-SY5Y cell model were constructed. CircCCDC6 expression in the two models was examined, and circCCDC6-involved mechanisms in neuronal pyroptosis and inflammation were analyzed through loss- and gain-of-function assays.
MCAO/R rat brain tissues and OGD/R-treated SH-SY5Y cells exhibited upregulated circCCDC6. Silencing circCCDC6 attenuated neuronal pyroptosis and inflammation in the brain tissue of MCAO/R rats. Overexpressing circCCDC6 or inhibiting miR-128-3p stimulated OGD/R-induced pyroptosis and inflammation in SH-SY5Y cells, while upregulating miR-128-3p attenuated OGD/R injury. CircCCDC6 silencing-induced effects on SH-SY5Y cells were antagonized by TXNIP overexpression.
Mechanistically, circCCDC6 mediates miR-128-3p and activates TXNIP/NLRP3, thereby promoting OGD/R-induced neuronal pyroptosis and inflammation. CircCCDC6 may provide a new strategy for the treatment of MCAO/R.",brain injury

Bevacizumab (BEV) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to VEGF-A and neutralises its actions. To better understand the role of VEGF-A in mTBI recovery, this study examined how BEV treatment affected outcomes in rats given a mTBI. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to sham-injury + vehicle treatment (VEH), sham-injury + BEV treatment, mTBI + VEH treatment, mTBI + BEV treatment groups. Treatment was administered intracerebroventricularly via a cannula beginning at the time of injury and continuing until the end of the study. Rats underwent behavioral testing after injury and were euthanized on day 11. In both females and males, BEV had a negative impact on cognitive function. mTBI and BEV treatment increased the expression of inflammatory markers in females. In males, BEV treatment altered markers related to hypoxia and vascular health. These novel findings of sex-specific responses to BEV and mTBI provide important insights into the role of VEGF-A in mTBI.",brain injury
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells suppress neuroinflammation and brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage.,"['MingmingLiu', 'DanniWang', 'LinXu', 'YanPan', 'HuachenHuang', 'MinshuLi', 'QiangLiu']","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) mobilizes circulating leukocytes that contribute to neuroinflammation and neural injury. However, little is known about the endogenous regulatory immune mechanisms to restrict neuroinflammation following ICH. We examined the role of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) that are a specialized subset of innate immune modulators in a mouse model of ICH. We found accumulation of ILC2 in the brain following acute ICH and a concomitant increase of ILC2 within the peripheral lymph nodes. Depletion of ILC2 exacerbated neurodeficits and brain edema after ICH in male and female mice. This aggravated ICH injury was accompanied by augmented microglia activity and leukocyte infiltration. In contrast, expansion of ILC2 using IL-33 led to reduced ICH injury, microglia activity and leukocyte infiltration. Notably, elimination of microglia using a colony stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor diminished the exacerbation of ICH injury induced by depletion of ILC2. Brain-infiltrating ILC2 had upregulation of IL-13 after ICH. Results from ",brain injury

The needs of families caring for patients with traumatic brain injury: a scoping review.,"['Joshua KMuliira', 'Eilean RLazarus', 'DevakirubaiJacob', 'HemaRoslin']","This scoping review was conducted to synthesize existing literature into a map of the common needs of families caring for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) at home.
A systematic search of studies published between January 2012 and December 2022 was conducted across databases. The selected studies reported the needs or unmet needs of patients with TBI and/or their family caregivers (FCs).
A total of 12 publications were identified. The results suggest that the common needs of families caring for patients with TBI at home include: information about TBI as a disease; information about the continuum of TBI healthcare services; information about adaptive technologies; education and skilling of FCs; psychological support and counseling; physical and occupational therapy services; follow-up care and transitional care management; respite care; peer support; financial assistance, advocacy, and legal services; emotional support from the family and community; and assistance with physical patient care and instrumental activities of daily living.
The mapped needs provide insight into supportive interventions required to enhance the health outcomes of patients with TBI and their families during and after rehabilitation. The needs also highlight directions for research and healthcare services for patients with TBI.
The families caring for patients with traumatic brain injury at home end up living in situations characterized by multiple unmet needs, and these can be a source of poor health outcomes for the family and patients with traumatic brain injury.The identified needs of families caring for patients with traumatic brain injury reveal gaps in the discharge planning and care coordination after acute and rehabilitation care.Addressing these needs requires a multidisciplinary approach and planning.Interventions using a holistic approach to address the identified needs may significantly improve the health outcomes of patients with traumatic brain injury and their families.",brain injury

In addition, TBI may cause paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of clonidine in patients with TBI and suspected PSH.
A retrospective cohort study for critically ill patients with TBI with suspected PSH admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) from 1 May 2016 to 31 January 2020 at a tertiary academic medical center. Eligible patients were categorized based on clonidine use during their ICU stay (Clonidine group vs. Control group). The primary outcome was the improvement in functional outcomes during ICU stay, defined by a delta Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). Secondary outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay, heart rate variation, and 90-day mortality.
A total of 2915 patients were screened, of which 169 were included. Based on multiple regression analysis, patients who received clonidine showed better improvement in functional outcomes by a higher mean delta GCS than patients who did not (Beta Coeff. 0.41; CI: 0.07 - 0.74; P = 0.02). In addition, the patient's GCS upon ICU discharge and IV opioids requirement on day three were higher in the clonidine group than control (beta coefficient (95% CI): 0.18 (0.03, 0.32); p = 0.02 and beta coefficient (95% CI): 1.38 (0.24, 2.52); p = 0.02, respectively).

Improved Transcranial Doppler Waveform Analysis for Intracranial Hypertension Assessment in Patients with Traumatic Brain Injury.,"['SérgioBrasil', 'HannahRomeijn', 'Esther KHaspels', 'WellingsonPaiva', 'ArjenSchaafsma']","Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a noninvasive bedside tool for cerebral hemodynamic assessments in multiple clinical scenarios. TCD, by means of measuring systolic and diastolic blood velocities, allows the calculation of the pulsatility index (PI), a parameter that is correlated with intracranial pressure (ICP). Nevertheless, the predictive value of the PI for raised ICP appears to be low, as it is subjected to several, often confounding, factors not related to ICP. Recently, the pulsatile apparent resistance (PaR) index was developed as a PI corrected for arterial blood pressure, reducing some of the confounding factors influencing PI. This study compares the predictive value of PaR versus PI for intracranial hypertension (IH) (ICP > 20 mm Hg) in patients with traumatic brain injury.
Patients with traumatic brain injury admitted to the neurocritical care unit who required invasive ICP monitoring were included prospectively within 5 days of admission. TCD measurements were performed in both middle cerebral arteries, allowing calculations of the PI and PaR. The optimal cutoff, discriminative power of these parameters for ICP ≥ 20 mm Hg, was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC).
In total, 93 patients were included. A total of 20 (22%) patients experienced IH during the recording sessions. The discriminative power was low for PI (AUC 0.63) but slightly higher for PaR (AUC 0.77). Nonparametric analysis indicated significant difference for PaR when comparing patients with (median 0.169) and without IH (median - 0.052, p = 0.001), whereas PI medians for patients with and without IH were 0.86 and 0.77, respectively (p =  0.041). Regarding subanalyses, the discriminative power of these parameters increased after exclusion of patients who had undergone a neurosurgical procedure. This was especially true for the PaR (AUC 0.89) and PI (AUC 0.72). Among these patients, a PaR cutoff value of - 0.023 had 100% sensitivity and 52.9% specificity.
In the present study, discriminative power of the PaR for discriminating IH was superior to the PI. The PaR seems to be a reliable noninvasive parameter for detecting IH. Further studies are warranted to define its clinical application, especially in aiding neurosurgical decision making, following up in intensive care units, and defining its ability to indicate responses according to the therapies administered.",brain injury

Cognitive assessments involved the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics to evaluate domains of attention, memory, reaction time, processing speed, and executive function. Physical performance was evaluated through clinical performance assessments, such as the 1-min walk test, the modified Illinois Agility Test, the Functional Gait Assessment Tool, the High-Level Mobility Assessment Tool, a complex turning course and a 4-Item Hybrid Assessment of Mobility for mTBI. Participants also completed additional trials of the 1-min walk test, modified Illinois Agility Test, and complex turning course with a simultaneous cognitive task.
Individuals with mTBI performed worse on cognitive assessments, as well as several of the physical performance assessments compared to healthy controls. Complex tasks were more strongly related to cognitive assessments compared to simple walking tasks.
Combining complex motor tasks with cognitive demands may better demonstrate functional performance in individuals recovering from mTBI.

From postnatal day 6 to day 8, the mice were administered inhaled sevoflurane or intraperitoneal melatonin. MMP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using appropriate detection kits. The protein expression levels of PSD95, Synapsin Ⅰ, and CypD in the hippocampus were analyzed through western blotting in acute and prolonged terms. Immunofluorescence staining was used to assess the co-localizations of PSD95 or CypD in parvalbumin (PV) neurons. Cognitive ability was evaluated through novel object recognition, social interaction experiment, and the Morris water maze.
The findings revealed that repeated exposure to sevoflurane in neonatal mice resulted in cognitive and synaptic impairment. Furthermore, melatonin administration suppressed the ROS and CypD protein expression, enhanced the MMP in mitochondria and synaptic protein expression in PV neurons, and ameliorated cognitive deficits.
Melatonin alleviated sevoflurane-induced cognitive deficits by suppressing CypD and promoting synaptic development in hippocampal PV neurons. These results provide valuable insights into a promising therapeutic approach for preventing neurotoxic injuries caused by general anesthetics.",brain injury
Chronic pain accelerates cognitive impairment by reducing hippocampal neurogenesis may via CCL2/CCR2 signaling in APP/PS1 mice.,"['LiliChen', 'QinQin', 'PanchuanHuang', 'FangliCao', 'MaojiaYin', 'YachenXie', 'WuchaoWang']","Patients with chronic pain often have cognitive impairment; this is especially true in elderly patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. This was addressed in the present study by investigating the effect of chronic neuropathic pain on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive impairment using amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice subjected to spared-nerve injury (SNI).

Patients With Better Outcome Have Higher ERP Response to Emotional Auditory Stimuli.,"['Galina VPortnova', 'Vitaliy VPodlepich', 'Ivan VSkorokhodov']","Accuracy of outcome prognosis is one of the most important tasks of coma arousal therapy. Reactions toward sensory stimuli are the most significant predictor of conscience and cognitive functions restoration after a brain injury. A paradigm that includes ERP registration has the advantage of detailed stimuli processing visualization. The authors aimed to investigate perception and distinguishing of emotionally significant sounds (crying and laughter) in coma patients with different consciousness restoration prognosis.
EEG was recorded in 24 comatose patients with different outcomes (scored with Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended) and 32 healthy volunteers. The authors presented sounds of crying and laughter. ERPs for sound stimulation were calculated.
An analysis of the correlation of ERP components and Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score was performed. P200 (r = 0.6, P = 0.0014) and N200 amplitudes (r = -0.56, P = 0.0037) for emotional sounds correlated with the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score. The significant differences of P300 and N400 amplitudes corresponded to differences of response between sounds of crying and laughter in subjects of the control group. Unlike the control group, comatose participants with good outcome produced similar electrical activity toward pleasant and unpleasant emotional stimuli.
Comatose patients with good outcome produced more prominent ERP for emotional sounds. Even the good outcome participants were unable to distinguish emotional sounds of different moods, which indicate the preservation of solely robust mechanisms of sound processing. N200 and P200 amplitudes for emotional stimuli correlated significantly with outcome prognosis in coma patients.",brain injury
The Neurosurgical Workforce of the Philippines.,"['Ronnie EBaticulon', 'Lynne Lourdes NLucena', 'Michael Louis AGimenez', 'Michael NSabalza', 'James ASoriano']","No study has comprehensively examined the delivery of neurosurgical care in the Philippines, a lower-middle-income country in Southeast Asia with a total population of 109 million. We aimed to quantify the workforce, map the distribution, and characterize the clinical practice of neurosurgeons across the 17 regions and 81 provinces of the Philippines.
An online survey was sent to all fellows of the Academy of Filipino Neurosurgeons and all graduates of neurosurgical training programs in the country. Neurosurgeons who have been in active clinical practice for at least 1 year were eligible to participate. A database of Filipino neurosurgeons was generated through personal communications, correspondence with neurosurgery departments, and accessing publicly available information. The top neurosurgical procedures were identified to estimate the overall volume of neurosurgical disease.
There are 174 neurosurgeons practicing in the Philippines or approximately one neurosurgeon for every 600 000 people. In 9 provinces, neurosurgeons were only available part-time, and 35 provinces had no neurosurgeons at all, equivalent to an underserved population of 24 million people. Among 99 survey respondents, the median numbers of neurosurgical consults and operations every month were 30 (IQR:35) and 8 (IQR:8), respectively. The top neurosurgical procedures were burr holes/craniotomy for traumatic brain injury, craniotomy for stroke, and biopsy/resection of brain tumors. There are an estimated 93 498 cases requiring essential neurosurgery every year.
Although positive trends have been observed in the number, distribution, and composition of neurosurgeons in the Philippines, there remains a large workforce deficit that needs to be addressed to provide timely, quality, and affordable neurosurgical care to the entire population.",brain injury
Interferon-γ controls aquaporin-4-specific Th17 and B cells in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.,"['GabrielArellano', 'EileahLoda', 'YananChen', 'TobiasNeef', 'Andrew CCogswell', 'GrantPrimer', 'GodwinJoy', 'KevinKaschke', 'SamanthaWills', 'Joseph RPodojil', 'BrianPopko', 'RoumenBalabanov', 'Stephen DMiller']","Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is a central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune inflammatory disease mediated by Th17 and antibody responses to the water channel protein, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), and associated with astrocytopathy, demyelination, and axonal loss. Knowledge about disease pathogenesis is limited and the search for new therapies impeded by the absence of a reliable animal model. In our work, we determined that NMOSD is characterized by decreased IFN-γ receptor signaling and that IFN-γ depletion in AQP4201-220 immunized C57BL/6 mice results in severe clinical disease resembling human NMOSD. Pathologically, the disease demonstrates autoimmune astrocytic and CNS injury secondary to cellular and humoral inflammation. Immunologically, absence of IFN-γ allows for an increased expression of IL-6 in B cells and activation of Th17 cells, and generation of a robust autoimmune inflammatory response. Consistent with NMOSD, the experimental disease is exacerbated by administration of IFN-β, whereas repletion of IFN-γ, as well as therapeutic targeting of IL-17A, IL-6R and B cells ameliorates it. We also demonstrate that immune tolerization with AQP4201-220 -coupled PLGA-nanoparticles could both prevent and effectively treat the disease. Our findings enhance the understanding of NMOSD pathogenesis and provide a platform for development of immune tolerance-based therapies avoiding the limitations of the current immunosuppressive therapies.",brain injury
Her6 and Prox1a are novel regulators of photoreceptor regeneration in the zebrafish retina.,"['KellieVeen', 'AaronKrylov', 'ShuguangYu', 'JieHe', 'PatrickBoyd', 'David RHyde', 'TheoMantamadiotis', 'Louise YCheng', 'Patricia RJusuf']","Damage to light-sensing photoreceptors (PRs) occurs in highly prevalent retinal diseases. As humans cannot regenerate new PRs, these diseases often lead to irreversible blindness. Intriguingly, animals, such as the zebrafish, can regenerate PRs efficiently and restore functional vision. Upon injury, mature Müller glia (MG) undergo reprogramming to adopt a stem cell-like state. This process is similar to cellular dedifferentiation, and results in the generation of progenitor cells, which, in turn, proliferate and differentiate to replace lost retinal neurons. In this study, we tested whether factors involved in dedifferentiation of Drosophila CNS are implicated in the regenerative response in the zebrafish retina. We found that hairy-related 6 (her6) negatively regulates of PR production by regulating the rate of cell divisions in the MG-derived progenitors. prospero homeobox 1a (prox1a) is expressed in differentiated PRs and may promote PR differentiation through phase separation. Interestingly, upon Her6 downregulation, Prox1a is precociously upregulated in the PRs, to promote PR differentiation; conversely, loss of Prox1a also induces a downregulation of Her6. Together, we identified two novel candidates of PR regeneration that cross regulate each other; these may be exploited to promote human retinal regeneration and vision recovery.",brain injury
A Pilot Study of the Effect of Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation on Micturition-Related Brain Activity and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms After Stroke.,"['Evgeniy IKreydin', 'AidinAbedi', 'Veronica StefaniaMontero', 'LuisMorales', 'RitaJen', 'LauraPerez', 'AnibalRincon', 'PriyaKohli', 'Charles YLiu', 'David AGinsberg', 'ParagGad', 'V ReggieEdgerton', 'KayJann']","Transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (TSCS) is a novel neuromodulation modality developed to promote functional restoration in patients with neurological injury or disease. Previous pilot data suggest that lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) due to stroke may be partially alleviated by TSCS. In this study, we examine the mechanism of this effect by evaluating bladder-related brain activity in patients before and after TSCS therapy and comparing it to healthy volunteers.
Patients who developed storage LUTD after a stroke and healthy volunteers without LUTD were recruited. Patients and healthy volunteers underwent simultaneous urodynamics and functional MRI. Patients then completed 24 biweekly sessions of TSCS and underwent another simultaneous urodynamics-functional MRI study. Clinical outcomes were assessed using validated questionnaires and voiding diary.
Fifteen patients and 16 healthy volunteers completed the study. Following TSCS, patients exhibited increased blood-oxygen-level dependent activity in areas including periaqueductal grey, the insula, the lateral prefrontal cortex, and motor cortex. Prior to TSCS therapy, healthy controls exhibited higher blood-oxygen-level dependent activity in 17 regions, including multiple regions in the prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. These differences were attenuated after TSCS with no frontal brain differences remaining between healthy volunteers and stroke participants who completed therapy. Neuroimaging changes were complemented by clinically significant improvements in questionnaire scores and voiding diary parameters.
TSCS therapy modulated bladder-related brain activity, reducing differences between healthy volunteers and stroke patients with LUTD. These changes, alongside improved clinical outcomes, suggest TSCS as a promising approach for LUTD management.",brain injury
"Cataracts after Ophthalmic and Nonophthalmic Trauma Exposure in Service Members, U.S. Armed Forces.","['MariiaViswanathan', 'WeidongGu', 'Richard JBlanch', 'Lucas LGroves']","IntroductionWe aimed to identify injury-related risk factors for secondary cataract incidence after eye and brain injury and polytrauma. We also examined the effect of direct and indirect eye injury management on cataract diagnosis and treatment. Prevention or mitigation strategies require knowledge of the causes and types of combat injuries, which will enable more appropriate targeting of resources toward prevention and more efficient management of such injuries.
Data were gathered from the Military Health System using the Military Health System Management and Analysis Reporting Tool (M2) between 2017 and 2021 from inpatient and outpatient Service Members (SMs) (active duty and National Guard). The date of the first cataract diagnosis was tracked to estimate the annual incidence rate, and it was longitudinally linked to any prior diagnosis of ocular trauma (OT), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or polytrauma to calculate the relative risk. International Classification of Disease codes, 10th Revision, were used to identify those diagnosed with cataracts, TBI, and polytrauma. Defense and Veterans Eye Injury and Vision Registry data were used to examine SMs who sustained ocular injuries from 2003-2020 and who may have had cataract surgery following a cataract diagnosis.
The relative risk of traumatic cataract formation from OT, TBI, and polytrauma are 5.71 (95% CI, 5.05-6.42), 2.32 (95% CI, 2.03-2.63), and 8.95 (95% CI, 6.23-12.38), respectively. Traumatic cataracts in SMs more commonly result from open-globe injuries (70%) than closed-globe injuries (30%). By specific sub-injury type, traumatic cataracts occur most frequently from intraocular foreign bodies (22%). More than 400 patients in the cohort suffered from TBI and traumatic cataracts, more than 300 from OT and cataracts, and more than 20 from polytrauma and cataracts. The battlefield is the riskiest environment for trauma exposure, with 62% of OT occurring in combat. There was a statistically significant difference between the mean visual acuity value before cataract surgery (M = 1.17, SD = 0.72) and the mean visual acuity value after cataract surgery (M = 0.44, SD = 0.66, P < .001).
Traumatic cataracts often occur in SMs who sustain ocular injuries. New to the literature is that relationships exist between traumatic cataract formation and nonglobe trauma, specifically TBI and polytrauma. Ocular injury calls for an ophthalmic examination. A low threshold should exist for routine ocular exam consultation in the setting of TBI and polytrauma. Separately, polytrauma patients should undergo a review of systems questions, particularly questions about the ocular and visual pathways. A positive response to screening warrants further investigation of possible ocular pathology, including traumatic cataract formation. Cataract surgery is an effective treatment in improving the vision of SMs who suffer from traumatic cataracts. Constant effort must be made to limit occurrences of occupation-related traumatic cataracts.",brain injury
A functional magnetic resonance imaging study using dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation to assess brain activity in patients with moyamoya disease.,"['QianWei', 'YiningWang', 'LijuanZhang', 'ChenyuYu', 'HuiyeShu', 'XulinLiao', 'SanhuaXu', 'TingSu', 'MingKang', 'YiShao']","Introduction：The purpose of this study was to monitor and record the dynamic brain activity of patients with moyamoya disease (MMD), as well as to study the relationship between brain abnormalities and presenting clinical features. Methods：A total of 16 patients with moyamoya disease (2 males and 14 females) were invited to participate in the study, as were healthy controls (HCs) with the same number and sexes. In this study, the dynamic amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (dALFF) was utilized to assess changes in spontaneous brain activity. Moreover, we also used correlation analysis to study the relationship among the measured mean of dALFF, behavioral performances, the retinal nerve fibre layer and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score to explore the potential relationship between moyamoya disease and anxiety and depression.

Human herpesvirus 6A and axonal injury before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis.,"['ViktorGrut', 'MartinBiström', 'JonatanSalzer', 'PernillaStridh', 'DanielJons', 'RasmusGustafsson', 'AnnaFogdell-Hahn', 'JesseHuang', 'JuliaButt', 'AnnaLindam', 'LuciaAlonso-Magdalena', 'TomasBergström', 'IngridKockum', 'TimWaterboer', 'TomasOlsson', 'HenrikZetterberg', 'KajBlennow', 'OlufAndersen', 'StaffanNilsson', 'PeterSundström']","Recent research indicates that multiple sclerosis is preceded by a prodromal phase with elevated levels of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL), a marker of axonal injury. The effect of environmental risk factors on the extent of axonal injury during this prodrome is unknown. Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) is associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. The objective of this study was to determine if HHV-6A serostatus is associated with the level of sNfL in the multiple sclerosis prodrome, which would support a causative role of HHV-6A. A nested case-control study was performed by crosslinking multiple sclerosis registries with Swedish biobanks. Individuals with biobank samples collected before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis were included as cases. Controls without multiple sclerosis were randomly selected, matched for biobank, sex, sampling date and age. Serostatus of HHV-6A and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was analysed with a bead-based multiplex assay. The concentration of sNfL was analysed with Single molecule array technology. The association between HHV-6A serology and sNfL was assessed by stratified t-tests and linear regressions, adjusted for EBV serostatus and sampling age. Within-pair ratios of HHV-6A seroreactivity and sNfL were calculated for each case and its matched control. To assess the temporal relationship between HHV-6A antibodies and sNfL, these ratios were plotted against the time to the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis and compared using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing regressions with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Samples from 519 matched case-control pairs were included. In cases, seropositivity of HHV-6A was significantly associated with the level of sNfL (+11%, 95% CI 0.2-24%, P = 0.045), and most pronounced in the younger half of the cases (+24%, 95% CI 6-45%, P = 0.007). No such associations were observed among the controls. Increasing seroreactivity against HHV-6A was detectable before the rise of sNfL (significant within-pair ratios from 13.6 years vs 6.6 years before the clinical onset of multiple sclerosis). In this study, we describe the association between HHV-6A antibodies and the degree of axonal injury in the multiple sclerosis prodrome. The findings indicate that elevated HHV-6A antibodies both precede and are associated with a higher degree of axonal injury, supporting the hypothesis that HHV-6A infection may contribute to multiple sclerosis development in a proportion of cases.",brain injury
Isolation of Pure Astrocytes and Microglia from the Adult Mouse Spinal Cord For In Vitro Assays and Transcriptomic Studies.,"['Julie JAhn', 'Robert HMiller', 'YusraIslam']","Astrocytes and microglia play pivotal roles in central nervous system development, injury responses, and neurodegenerative diseases. These highly dynamic cells exhibit rapid responses to environmental changes and display significant heterogeneity in terms of morphology, transcriptional profiles, and functions. While our understanding of the functions of glial cells in health and disease has advanced substantially, there remains a need for in vitro, cell-specific analyses conducted in the context of insults or injuries to comprehensively characterize distinct cell populations. Isolating cells from the adult mouse offers several advantages over cell lines or neonatal animals, as it allows for the analysis of cells under pathological conditions and at specific time points. Furthermore, focusing on spinal cord-specific isolation, excluding brain involvement, enables research into spinal cord pathologies, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, spinal cord injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This protocol presents an efficient method for isolating astrocytes and microglia from the adult mouse spinal cord, facilitating immediate or future analysis with potential applications in functional, molecular, or proteomic downstream studies.",brain injury
"Study of fingolimod, nitric oxide inhibitor, and P-glycoprotein inhibitor in modulating the P-glycoprotein expression via an endothelin-sphingolipid pathway in an animal model of pharmacoresistant epilepsy.","['NitikaGarg', 'RupaJoshi', 'AlkaBhatia', 'SeemaBansal', 'AmitavaChakrabarti', 'AjayPrakash', 'BimanSaikia', 'ManishModi', 'BikashMedhi']","The overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) contributes to drug resistance in patients with epilepsy, and the change of P-gp expression located at the blood-brain barrier alienates the anti-seizure effects of P-gp substrates. Thus, the present study explored the effect of fingolimod (FTY720) acting through an endothelin-sphingolipid pathway on P-gp-induced pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-kindled phenobarbital (PB)-resistant rats.
PTZ kindling (30 mg/kg; i.p.) and PB (40 mg/kg; orally) were used to develop an animal model of refractory epilepsy. The effect of Fingolimod on seizure score (Racine scale), plasma and brain levels of PB (high-performance liquid chromatography), and blood-brain barrier permeability (Evans blue dye) was determined. Further, Fingolimod's neuroprotective effect was determined by measuring the levels of various inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress parameters, and neurotrophic factors in rat brain homogenate. The Fingolimod's effect on P-gp expression was estimated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry in rat brain. The H and E staining was done to determine the neuronal injury.
Fingolimod significantly (P < 0.001) reduced the seizure score in a dose-dependent manner and alleviated the blood-brain barrier permeability. It decreased the P-gp expression, which further increased the brain PB concentration. Fingolimod significantly (P < 0.01) reduced oxidative stress as well as inflammation. Moreover, it attenuated the raised neuronal injury score in a resistant model of epilepsy.
The modulation of the P-gp expression by Fingolimod improved drug delivery to the brain in an animal model of refractory epilepsy. Therefore, S1P signaling could serve as an additional therapeutic target to overcome refractoriness.",brain injury
StatPearls,"['SarahSpiegel', 'Annalee M.Baker']","In the United States, trauma remains the leading cause of death in patients aged 46 and younger and the fourth leading cause of mortality across all age groups. Trauma fatalities are mostly due to catastrophic hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury. Most hemorrhage-related traumatic deaths occur in the first 2 hours after injury, though around one-fourth of the cases are preventable. Proper prehospital care, including swift medical or surgical hemorrhage control, can dramatically impact mortality and patient outcomes. The use of extremity tourniquets is perhaps the most well-known prehospital intervention for traumatic hemorrhage. Tourniquets control hemorrhage, occluding the injured artery by applying constant, firm circumferential pressure proximal to the bleeding site. As with other aspects of evidence-based trauma care, military data provided the earliest robust evidence for tourniquets' usefulness in controlling hemorrhage. The widespread application of extremity tourniquets in recent Iraq and Afghanistan wars successfully reduced hemorrhage-related mortality. Subsequently, in 2015, a federal interagency workgroup launched a nationwide public health campaign called “Stop the Bleed.” The program translates combat medicine's hemorrhage control techniques to the civilian sphere by teaching basic bystander actions that stem life-threatening bleeding. Additionally, tourniquets have become increasingly available to trained civilian EMS providers. After seeing the success of extremity tourniquets, the focus has now shifted to preventing battlefield deaths by exsanguination from sites not amenable to tourniquet use. Traditional trauma education programs teach that 6 locations must be considered as sources of potentially fatal hemorrhage in a trauma patient: 1. Chest cavity. 2. Abdominal cavity. 3. Retroperitoneum. 4. Pelvis. 5. Long bone fractures. 6. “Street” (scalp or other external sources). While identifying the bleeding site is critical, determining whether or not it is manually compressible is also vital. Deep areas of internal bleeding, such as solid organ injury in the abdominal cavity, clearly cannot be easily controlled or recognized in the prehospital setting. However, hemorrhage from an extremity long bone fracture may be controlled by proper proximal tourniquet application. Scalp and other external wounds may respond to direct manual pressure, wound packing, or pressure dressings.   Enemy use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) in recent wars led to an increase in pelvic fracture cases with associated groin or high leg injuries. The term ""junctional hemorrhage"" was introduced in the literature in 2009, referring to hemorrhage in the junction between the torso and the neck or one or more extremities. That time was also marked by renewed efforts to develop techniques and devices for junctional hemorrhage control both on the battlefield and at home. Sites involved in junctional hemorrhage include the groin, axilla, perineum, shoulder girdle, and base of the neck. Hemorrhage in these areas is potentially life-threatening and must not be missed during prehospital management. Junctional hemorrhage may or may not be manually compressible. However, it is generally not amenable to traditional tourniquets due to the injury's proximal location. Rapid exsanguination and death may result from uncontrolled junctional hemorrhage. Studies estimate that 19% of preventable Iraq and Afghanistan battlefield deaths between 2001 and 2011 involved junctional hemorrhage.  When compressible, junctional injuries often require constant, direct manual pressure against the site. This is often challenging to achieve due to the typically limited personnel and unpredictability of circumstances in prehospital settings. Wound packing, hemostatic agents and dressings, junctional tourniquet devices, and others may be necessary to control junctional hemorrhage in the field and increase survival rates. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers must be trained to properly and promptly recognize, assess, and manage junctional injuries. This article will review the considerations and most current management options for prehospital junctional hemorrhage control.",brain injury
StatPearls,"['Logan R.Ranzenberger', 'JoeM Das', 'TravisSnyder']","Advanced magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging modalities are becoming more available and useful as their value in the diagnosis and prognosis of central nervous system diseases is more fully studied and understood. Specifically, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become increasingly studied and utilized in recent years. It has become incorporated by many radiologists into routine clinical practice, with most research performed on traumatic brain injury (TBI). DTI is a variant of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) that utilizes a tissue water diffusion rate for image production. The first application of DWI to the human brain was performed in 1986 and since has become the gold standard for detecting acute stroke. DTI does not require contrast and is available on almost all modern MR scanners with relatively quick scan times for this sequence. Random thermal motion, or Brownian motion, is water molecular diffusion in three-dimensional (3D) space. Isotropy is defined as uniformity in all directions, and when applied to water molecules, isotropy occurs when the diffusion of water is entirely uninhibited (such as water movement in a glass of water). Anisotropy is when there is a directionality in the diffusion of water present, and the movement of water is no longer random (such as water movement along straws placed in a glass). The greater the anisotropy, the more directional and linear the diffusion of water molecules. Water molecules will diffuse differently through space depending on the tissue type, components, structure, architecture, and integrity; these principles allow clinically significant imaging to occur, particularly the DTI. The latter measures the movement of water along axons, analogous to the straws in a glass of water. As early as May 2002, medical literature reported that DTI showed abnormalities in patients who suffered from mild brain trauma as compared to normal control subjects. ""This study included five patients with mild traumatic brain injury (three men and two women) and ten volunteers with no known neurological disorders (five men and five women)."" This study reported abnormalities in the patients with a mild brain injury that were absent in the control subjects or the uninvolved sides of the injured patients' brains: ""Patients displayed a significant reduction of diffusion anisotropy in several regions compared with the homologous ones in the contralateral hemisphere. Such differences were not observed in the control subjects. Significant reduction of diffusion anisotropy was also detected when diffusion tensor results from the patients were compared with those of the controls."" DWI uses volume elements (voxels) as a statistical method for data collection. When a voxel contains scalar values constituting a vector, it is known as a tensor, where DTI receives its name and explains the additional information provided through DTI. DTI MR settings can measure the diffusion of water along an axon in many directions; 6, 9, 33, and 90 directions are typical parameters used, with 33 directions and above increasing confidence in the accuracy. Ninety directions typically require upwards of 20 additional minutes in the MR scanner. Therefore, it may not be suitable for routine clinical practice. In effect, DTI will provide an indirect method of assessing neuroanatomy structure on a microscopic level using water molecules' degree of anisotropy and structural orientation within a voxel. Therefore, the principal application for DTI is in the imaging of white matter, where the orientation, location, and anisotropy of the tracts can be measured and evaluated. The architecture of the axons in parallel bundles and their myelin sheaths facilitate the diffusion of the water molecules preferentially along their main direction. There are several measures calculated using DTI that can provide quantitative power. One of the most widely used DTI measures is fractional anisotropy (FA). Others include mean diffusivity or apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), radial (perpendicular) diffusivity, and axial (parallel) diffusivity. DTI uses mean diffusivity for the rate of molecular diffusion, FA for the summative direction of the diffusion, which provides a prominent vector, axial diffusivity for the rate of diffusion parallel to the main vector, and radial diffusivity for the rate of diffusion perpendicular to the main vector. FA quantifies the directionality of diffusivity in a summative manner and is highly sensitive to change in microstructure; however, it can be nonspecific to the cause of change. Mean diffusivity quantifies cellular and membrane density, whereas an increase in mean diffusivity indicates disease processes such as edema or necrosis. Radial diffusivity quantifies myelin neuropathology and increases with demyelination. Axial diffusivity quantifies axonal degeneration and increases with brain maturation. FA values are numerical values based on the anisotropy of water along the axon, which reflects the health of the axon. Abnormal FA values indicate axonal damage. FA values can be calculated utilizing the region of interest (ROI) method, whole-brain analysis (Voxel-Based analysis), or tract-based spatial statistics. The whole-brain analysis is gaining popularity due to its automation and ability to analyze more tracts. The ROI method, where the regions to be analyzed are traced by a technologist and then analyzed by a computer, remains reliable and replicable. One of the more common and standardized ROI methods is the segmented corpus callosal values. Being the largest axonal tract in the brain, damage to the corpus callosum is well described following head trauma and other pathologies (see ",brain injury

High intensity interval training as a novel treatment for impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia in people with type 1 diabetes (HIT4HYPOS): a randomised parallel-group study.,"['Catriona MFarrell', 'Alison DMcNeilly', 'SimonaHapca', 'Paul AFournier', 'Timothy WJones', 'AndreaFacchinetti', 'GiacomoCappon', 'Daniel JWest', 'Rory JMcCrimmon']","Impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) in type 1 diabetes may develop through a process referred to as habituation. Consistent with this, a single bout of high intensity interval exercise as a novel stress stimulus improves counterregulatory responses (CRR) to next-day hypoglycaemia, referred to as dishabituation. This longitudinal pilot study investigated whether 4 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) has sustained effects on counterregulatory and symptom responses to hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes and IAH.
HIT4HYPOS was a single-centre, randomised, parallel-group study. Participants were identified using the Scottish Diabetes Research Network (SDRN) and from diabetes outpatient clinics in NHS Tayside, UK.

During the hyperinsulinaemic-hypoglycaemic clamp studies, mean (SEM) change from baseline was greater for the noradrenergic responses (RT-CGM vs RT-CGM+HIIT: -988 [447] vs 514 [732] pmol/l, p=0.02) but not the adrenergic responses (-298 [687] vs 1130 [747] pmol/l, p=0.11) in those participants who had undergone RT-CGM+HIIT. There was a benefit of RT-CGM+HIIT for mean (SEM) change from baseline in the glucagon CRR to hypoglycaemia (RT-CGM vs RT-CGM+HIIT: 1 [4] vs 16 [6] ng/l, p=0.01). Consistent with the hormone response, the mean (SEM) symptomatic response to hypoglycaemia (adjusted for baseline) was greater following RT-CGM+HIIT (RT-CGM vs RT-CGM+HIIT: -4 [2] vs 0 [2], p<0.05).
In this pilot clinical trial in people with type 1 diabetes and IAH, we found continuing benefits of HIIT for overall hormonal and symptomatic CRR to subsequent hypoglycaemia. Our findings also suggest that HIIT may improve the glucagon response to insulin-induced hypoglycaemia.

Satisfaction with diabetes involvement: Exploring parent and adolescent perspectives.,"['Jessie JWong', 'Sarah JHanes', 'HaleyFlores', 'JessicaNgo', 'Korey KHood']","Both parent and adolescent involvement in type 1 diabetes management are critical during adolescence. The current study sought to understand the factors associated with parent and adolescent satisfaction with their own and one another's involvement in diabetes management.
Cross-sectional baseline data from 157 parent-adolescent dyads enrolled in an RCT were used. Adolescent ages ranged from 12 to 19 (M
Roughly, 43% of adolescents and 29% of parents were very satisfied with adolescent involvement in diabetes management, whereas 71% of adolescents and 26.1% of parents were very satisfied with parent involvement. Indicators of better glycaemic health (via higher percent time-in-range and lower HbA1c and percent time in hyperglycaemia) and psychosocial functioning (less diabetes distress and depression) were correlated with higher satisfaction. Parent satisfaction with adolescent involvement was higher among older adolescents (R = 0.198, p = 0.013). Non-Hispanic white youth were more satisfied with their own involvement than youth of colour (t(149) = -2.783, p = 0.003). Both percent time-in-range and one's own diabetes distress uniquely related to parent and adolescent satisfaction with adolescent involvement. Conversely, parent satisfaction with their own involvement was only uniquely associated with parent diabetes distress.
Both adolescent and parents' satisfaction with adolescents' involvement in self-management are indicators of both glycaemic control and psychosocial well-being, whereas parents' self-evaluations are more closely tied to diabetes-specific distress.",type 2 diabetics
Is there any robust evidence showing that SGLT2 inhibitor predisposes to cancer?,"['SidarCopur', 'Abdullah BYildiz', 'AdrianCovic', 'MehmetKanbay']","The exact pathophysiological mechanisms of SGLT-2 inhibitors in the development, progression or treatment of malignancies are not fully understood, but multiple hypotheses have been proposed. SGLT-2 inhibitors have potential anti-proliferative roles due to several underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, such as inhibition of ATP production, activation of AMPK signalling, induction of apoptosis and ferroptosis, inhibition of glutamate dehydrogenase activity and inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis. However, heterogeneity among tumour cells and SGLT-2 inhibitor drugs limit the generalizability of pre-clinical studies.
This is a narrative review discussing the potential anti-cancer effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors, an oral glucose-lowering medication used in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. This review discusses underlying mechanisms, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, epidemiological data and future perspectives on the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors in cancer treatment.
Type II diabetes is linked to various comorbidities and malignancies, but some glucose-slowering medications may have a preventive role in cancer. The use of SGLT-2 inhibitors was associated with bladder cancer based on mice studies. However, meta-analyses showed no significant increase in overall malignancy incidence of any specific type, except for empagliflozin and bladder cancer association. SGLT-2 inhibitors can potentially reduce the heart damage caused by doxorubicin and sunitinib, while enhancing the anti-cancer effects of doxorubicin. Combining SGLT-2 inhibitors with doxorubicin may allow higher doses of chemotherapy use. Multiple ongoing clinical trials are investigating the potential therapeutic potential of SGLT-2 inhibitors in various types of cancer.
More large-scale pre-clinical and clinical studies are needed to explore their potential preventive and therapeutic roles of SGLT-2 inhibitors in cancer treatment. In this narrative review, our aim is to explore the pre-clinical and clinical data regarding the potential anti-cancer effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors including the hypothetical pathophysiological mechanisms.",type 2 diabetics

Existing prognostic recurrence models based on clinicopathological features continue to be a subject of controversy. In this meta-analysis, we summarized research findings that explored the correlation between clinicopathological characteristics and post-surgery survival outcomes in non-metastatic RCC patients. Our analysis incorporates 99 publications spanning 140 568 patients. The study's main findings indicate that the following clinicopathological characteristics were associated with unfavorable survival outcomes: T stage, tumor grade, tumor size, lymph node involvement, tumor necrosis, sarcomatoid features, positive surgical margins (PSM), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), early recurrence, constitutional symptoms, poor performance status (PS), low hemoglobin level, high body-mass index (BMI), diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension. All of which emerged as predictors for poor recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival. Clear cell (CC) subtype, urinary collecting system invasion (UCSI), capsular penetration, perinephric fat invasion, renal vein invasion (RVI) and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) were all associated with poor RFS. In contrast, age, sex, tumor laterality, nephrectomy type and approach had no impact on survival outcomes. As part of an additional analysis, we attempted to assess the association between these characteristics and late recurrences (relapses occurring more than 5 years after surgery). Nevertheless, we did not find any prediction capabilities for late disease recurrences among any of the features examined. Our findings highlight the prognostic significance of various clinicopathological characteristics potentially aiding in the identification of high-risk RCC patients and enhancing the development of more precise prediction models.",type 2 diabetics

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different levels of HbA1c control on coronary physiology in patients who underwent PCI for coronary heart disease combined with type 2 diabetes mellitus by quantitative flow ratio (QFR).
Patients who successfully underwent PCI and completed 1-year coronary angiographic follow up were enrolled, clinical data were collected, and QFR at immediate and 1-year follow up after PCI was retrospectively analyzed. A total of 257 patients (361 vessels) were finally enrolled and divided into the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)-compliance group (103 patients, 138 vessels) and non-HbA1c-compliance group (154 patients, 223 vessels) according to the HbA1c cut-off value of 7%. We compared the results of QFR analysis and clinical outcomes between the two groups.
At 1-year follow up after PCI, the QFR was significantly higher (0.94 ± 0.07 vs 0.92 ± 0.10, P = 0.019) and declined less (0.014 ± 0.066 vs 0.033 ± 0.095, P = 0.029) in the HbA1c-compliance group. Meanwhile, the incidence of physiological restenosis was lower in the HbA1c-compliance group (2.9% vs 8.5%, P = 0.034). Additionally, the target vessel revascularization rate was lower in the HbA1c-compliance group (6.8% vs 16.9%, P = 0.018).

Effect of interleukin-12 gene expression on insulin resistance in patients with acne vulgaris.,"['Ahmed IbrahimAbdElneam', 'Mohammed SalehAl-Dhubaibi', 'Saleh SalemBahaj', 'Ghada FaroukMohammed', 'Ahmed KaidAlantry', 'Lina MAtef']","Insulin resistance (IR) is a condition where cells become resistant to insulin, causing impaired glucose uptake and increased blood glucose levels. Interleukin-12 (IL-12), a cytokine, regulates the immune system. High levels of IL-12 can lead to chronic inflammation, exacerbate resistance to insulin, and contribute to type 2 diabetes. Also, link IR to acne vulgaris (AV), as it reduces tissue sensitivity to insulin, causing increased insulin levels and sebum production, which can contribute to acne development.
To explore the role of IL-12 gene expression on IR in AV patients and to study the role of IL-12 gene in the development of AV.
A case-control study was performed on 68 AV patients and 68 healthy controls. The biochemical analysis included fasting glucose, fasting insulin, (HOMA-IR), and serum IL-12 level. IL-12 gene expression was performed by quantitative real-time PCR for both two groups. In addition, folding change was calculated by using the standard 2-(∆∆Ct) method.
IL-12 level, IL-12 folding change, fasting insulin, and IR were all increased in acne patients. A highly significant linear correlation was found between IL-12 folding change and both IL-12 levels and IR. There is a substantial positive significant simple linear association between IL-12 level and IL-12 folding change, as well as IR and IL-12 folding change, in moderate and severe acne.

This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness and safety of a weight-based and ratio of 1:1.5 basal-bolus insulin using an algorithm for both initiation and titration in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Hospitalized patients with T2D were randomly assigned to two groups in equal numbers to receive 1:1.5 and 1:1 ratios of basal-bolus insulin using a weight-based algorithm for both initiation and titration. The primary outcome was the time taken to reach the fasting blood glucose (FBG) target and 2-h postprandial blood glucose (2hBG) targets after three meals. The secondary outcome included insulin dosage to achieve glycemic control and the incidence of hypoglycemia during hospitalization.
250 patients were screened between October 2021 and June 2022, 220 were randomly grouped, and 182 completed the trial (89 in the 1:1.5 and 93 in the 1:1 groups). The time taken to reach FBG targets was comparable between the two groups (3.4 ± 1.7 vs. 3.0 ± 1.3 days, p = 0.137) within about 3 days. The 2hBG after three meals was shorter in the 1:1.5 group than in the 1:1group (2.9 ± 1.5 vs. 3.4 ± 1.4 days, p = 0.015 for breakfast, 3.0 ± 1.6 vs. 3.6 ± 1.4 days, p = 0.005 for lunch, and 3.1 ± 2.1 vs. 4.0 ± 1.5 days, p = 0.002 for dinner). No significant difference in insulin dosages was found between the two groups at the end of the study. The incidence of hypoglycemia was similar in both groups.
We demonstrated that fixed dose-ratio basal-bolus insulin at 1:1.5 calculated using a weight-based initiation and titration algorithm was simple, as effective, and safe as ratio at 1:1 in managing T2D in hospitalized patients.

Patients with T1D using the CGM system Freestyle Libre were included in this analysis. The association of CGM-metrics and HbA1c with diabetes complications (any complication, microvascular complications, or macrovascular complications) was assessed using logistic regression unadjusted and adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration (model 1), and further adjusted for hypertension and dyslipidemia (model 2).
One hundred and sixty-one patients with T1D were included. The mean (± SD) age was 37.4 ± 13.4 years old and the median T1D duration was 17.7 ± 10.6 years. Time in range (TIR) was associated with any complication and microvascular complications in the unadjusted model and in the adjusted models. TIR was associated with retinopathy in the unadjusted model as well as in model 1, and was associated with macrovascular complications only in the unadjusted model. HbA1c was associated with any complications, microvascular complications, and retinopathy in the unadjusted model but not in the adjusted models. HbA1c was associated with macrovascular complications in the unadjusted model and in the adjusted model 1.
In this cross-sectional analysis of patients with T1D using intermittent scanned CGM, TIR, and HbA1c were associated with complications of diabetes. TIR may be a better predictor than HbA1c of any complication and microvascular complications, while HbA1c may be a better predictor of macrovascular complications.",type 2 diabetics
Management of cardiovascular risk in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"['AndersMellemkjær', 'Mikkel BreinholtKjær', 'DavidHaldrup', 'HenningGrønbæk', 'Karen LouiseThomsen']","The novel term Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) is proposed to replace non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to highlight the close association with the metabolic syndrome. MASLD encompasses patients with liver steatosis and at least one of five cardiometabolic risk factors which implies that these patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Indeed, the prevalence of CVD in MASLD patients is increased and CVD is recognized as the most common cause of death in MASLD patients. We here present an update on the pathophysiology of CVD in MASLD, discuss the risk factors, and suggest screening for CVD in patients with MASLD. Currently, there is no FDA-approved pharmacological treatment for MASLD, and no specific treatment recommended for CVD in patients with MASLD. Thus, the treatment strategy is based on weight loss and a reduction and treatment of CVD risk factors. We recommend screening of MASLD patients for CVD using the SCORE2 system with guidance to specific treatment algorithms. In all patients with CVD risk factors, lifestyle intervention to induce weight loss through diet and exercise is recommended. Especially a Mediterranean diet may improve hyperlipidemia and if further treatment is needed, statins should be used as first-line treatment. Further, anti-hypertensive drugs should be used to treat hypertension. With the epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) the risk of MASLD and CVD is expected to increase, and preventive measures, screening, and effective treatments are highly needed to reduce morbidity and mortality in MASLD patients.",type 2 diabetics
Physiological 4-phenylbutyrate promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism in C2C12 myotubes.,"['Caroline NRivera', 'Carly ESmith', 'Lillian VDraper', 'Rachel MWatne', 'Andrew JWommack', 'Roger AVaughan']","Type 2 diabetes is characterized by elevated circulating blood metabolites such as glucose, insulin, and branched chain amino acids (BCAA), which often coincide with reduced mitochondrial function. 4-Phenylbutyrate (PBA), an ammonia scavenger, has been shown to activate BCAA metabolism, resolve endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and rescue BCAA-mediated insulin resistance. To determine the effect of PBA on the altered metabolic phenotype featured in type 2 diabetes, the present study investigated the effect of PBA on various metabolic parameters including mitochondrial metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. C2C12 myotubes were treated with PBA at 0.5 mM (representing physiologically attainable blood concentrations) or 10 mM (representing physiologically unattainable/proof-of-concept levels) for up to 24 h. Mitochondrial and glycolytic metabolism were assessed via oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rate, respectively. Mitochondrial content, lipid content, and ER stress were measured by fluorescent staining. Metabolic gene expression was measured by qRT-PCR. Both doses of PBA increased expression of indicators of mitochondrial biogenesis, though only PBA at 0.5 mM increased mitochondrial function and content while 10 mM PBA reduced mitochondrial function and content. PBA at 0.5 mM also rescued reduced mitochondrial function during insulin resistance, though PBA also caused a reduced insulin stimulated pAkt expression during insulin resistance. PBA treatment also increased extracellular BCAA accumulation during insulin resistance despite unchanged pBCKDH expression. Taken together, PBA may increase mitochondrial biogenesis, content, and function in a dose-dependent fashion which may have implications for prevention or treatment of metabolic disease such as insulin resistance.",type 2 diabetics

The six-month, seven-visit hybrid program was facilitated by a case manager (CM) serving as the liaison between participants and the care team. Primary end-points were: within-group and between-group changes from baseline in HbA1c at the last visit; and adoption of CGM.
Of the 57 eligible YA, 24 were enrolled and 33 were unable to participate (UTP). Thirteen of the enrolled participants attended at least 4/7 visits (""completers"", C), whereas 11 were non-completers (NC). HbA1c at the end of the program was significantly lower in the C vs UTP group [median -1.0; IQR (-0.6, -2.5) vs. -0.25 (0.2, -1.0) in UTP; P<0.05]. The percentage of CGM users significantly increased by 70% in the C group (P<0.05), but did not change in NC and UTP group. Limited access to telehealth and high cost for frequent visits were the main hurdles preventing enrollment into or completion of the program.

A total of 446,813 young adults aged 20-39 years with prediabetes who underwent two National Health Screening examinations from 2009 to 2012 were followed-up. NAFLD was defined as a fatty liver index (FLI) ≥60 without liver disease or history of alcohol abuse. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and confidence intervals (CIs) for type 2 diabetes according to NAFLD changes.
During a median follow-up of 8.3 years, 26,464 (5.9%) young individuals developed type 2 diabetes. Multivariable adjusted HR of type 2 diabetes according to the NAFLD change was 5.38 (95% CI 5.08-5.70) in individuals with persistent NAFLD when compared to those who never had NAFLD. Even in individuals who were consistently nonobese, resolved NAFLD, new NAFLD, and persistent NAFLD were associated with > three-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes compared to nonobese individuals without NAFLD. The risk of type 2 diabetes also increased in obese individuals without NAFLD by two-fold when compared to nonobese individuals without NAFLD.

Structural rearrangement of elastin under oxidative stress.,"['DebdipBrahma', 'TamalSarkar', 'RupalKaushik', 'Akshay NarayanSarangi', 'Amar NathGupta']","Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key elements in several physiological processes. A high level of ROS leads to oxidative stress that damages biomolecules and is linked to many diseases like type-2 diabetes, cancer, inflammation, and many more. Here, our in-vitro study aimed to gauge the effect of ROS on the structural rearrangement of elastin through metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO) at physiological temperature through laser light scattering, UV-vis, FTIR, and FESEM imaging. Light scattering data show a decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of elastin upon oxidation for the first hour. The rate of size reduction of ROS-treated elastin and the rate for self-assembly of bare elastin in the first two hours is found to be almost the same. However, the rate of association of ROS-treated is one order slower than the bare elastin after one hour. UV-vis absorption shows a blue shift accompanied by increased absorption, followed by a redshift and broadening of peak. FTIR data reveal changes in the secondary structures for both bare and oxidized elastin with time. While bare elastin coacervation increases unordered structure, the corresponding case of oxidized elastin saw a rise in β-sheet. FESEM images show the morphological changes occurring with time. Thus, we conclude that oxidative stress leads to structural rearrangement of the protein through interaction with the polar and hydrophobic domains, followed by aggregation. This study might be helpful for therapeutics focusing on preventing elastin degradation against aging.",type 2 diabetics

We also conduct a bioactive dietary fiber screening to induce P. distasonis growth. Dendrobium officinale polysaccharide (DOP) shows favorable growth-promoting effects on P. distasonis and protects against IR in mice simultaneously. Finally, the reduced P. distasonis and NA levels were also validated in another human type 2 diabetes mellitus cohort. These findings reveal the unique mechanisms of P. distasonis on IR and provide viable strategies for the treatment and prevention of IR by bioactive dietary fiber.",type 2 diabetics
Ultra-processed food intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in Korean adults.,"['YoonkyoungCho', 'SeaunRyu', 'RockliKim', 'Min-JeongShin', 'HannahOh']","Several studies from the U.S. and European countries reported a positive association between ultra-processed food intake and diabetes risk. However, little is known about the association in Asian populations. It is also unknown about the individual ultra-processed food items that are most unfavorably associated with diabetes risk.
We examined the associations of ultra-processed food intake (combined, as well as individual ultra-processed food items) with the risk of type 2 diabetes.
This prospective analysis included 7,438 participants aged 40-69 years from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study Ansan-Ansung cohort. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline using a 103-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Ultra-processed foods were classified using the Nova definition. Incident type 2 diabetes cases were identified via follow-up interviews and health examination. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders.
During the follow-up (2001-2019; median: 15 years), a total of 1,187 type 2 diabetes cases were identified. Compared to the lowest quartile of ultra-processed food intake, the highest quartile was positively associated with diabetes risk (HR [95% CI]=1.34 [1.13, 1.59], P-trend=0.002). The association did not change after additional adjustment for diet quality or BMI. Among individual ultra-processed food items, higher consumption of ham/sausage (per 1% increase in weight ratio: HR [95% CI]=1.40 [1.05, 1.86]), instant noodles (1.07 [1.02, 1.11]), ice cream (1.08 [1.03, 1.13]), and carbonated beverages (1.02 [1.00, 1.04]) were associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas higher intake of candy/chocolate was associated with a decreased risk (0.78 [0.62, 0.99]).
Our data suggest that high intake of ultra-processed foods, particularly ham/sausage, instant noodles, ice cream, and carbonated beverages, is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in Korean adults.
This prospective cohort study with a long follow-up found a positive association between ultra-processed food intake and diabetes risk in Korean adults.",type 2 diabetics
Elucidation of the anti-β-cell dedifferentiation mechanism of a modified Da Chaihu Decoction by an integrative approach of network pharmacology and experimental verification.,"['HongdongChen', 'JingGuo', 'YuziCai', 'ChaoZhang', 'FudongWei', 'HaoSun', 'ChengCheng', 'WeijingLiu', 'ZhongchenHe']","Modified Da Chaihu decoction (MDCH) is a traditional Chinese herbal prescription that has been used in the clinic to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D). Previous studies have confirmed that MDCH improves glycemic and lipid metabolism, enhances pancreatic function, and alleviates insulin resistance in patients with T2D and diabetic rats. Evidence has demonstrated that MDCH protects pancreatic β cells via regulating the gene expression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1). However, the detailed mechanism remains unclear.
Dedifferentiation of pancreatic β cells mediated by FOXO1 has been recognized as the main pathogenesis of T2D. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of MDCH on T2D in vitro and in vivo to elucidate the potential molecular mechanisms.
To predict the key targets of MDCH in treating T2D, network pharmacology methods were used. A T2D model was induced in diet-induced obese (DIO) C57BL/6 mice with a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Glucose metabolism indicators (oral glucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test), lipid metabolism indicators (total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), inflammatory factors (C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis factor alpha), oxidative stress indicators (total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde), and hematoxylin and eosin staining were analyzed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MDCH on T2D. Immunofluorescence staining and quantification of FOXO1, pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), NK6 homeobox 1 (NKX6.1), octamer-binding protein 4 (OCT4), neurogenin 3 (Ngn3), insulin, and SIRT1, and Western blot analysis of insulin, SIRT1, and FOXO1 were performed to investigate the mechanism by which MDCH inhibited pancreatic β-cell dedifferentiation.
The chemical ingredients identified in MDCH were predicted to be important for signaling pathways related to lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, including lipids in atherosclerosis, the advanced glycation end product receptor of the advanced glycation end product signaling pathway, and the FOXO signaling pathway. Experimental studies showed that MDCH improved glucose and lipid metabolism in T2D mice, alleviated inflammation and oxidative stress damage, and reduced pancreatic pathological damage. Furthermore, MDCH upregulated the expression levels of SIRT1, FOXO1, PDX1, and NKX6.1, while downregulating the expression levels of OCT4 and Ngn3, which indicated that MDCH inhibited pancreatic dedifferentiation of β cells.
MDCH has therapeutic effects on T2D, through regulating the SIRT1/FOXO1 signalling pathway to inhibit pancreatic β-cell dedifferentiation, which has not been reported previously.",type 2 diabetics
Molecular mechanism of microRNA-mediated hypoglycemic effect of whole grain highland barley.,"['MengyuanQin', 'XinRen', 'MinZhang', 'ZenglongChen', 'JingShen']","As a non-coding RNA, microRNA (miRNA) has been proven to play an important role in the development and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Highland barley is a whole grain from the Tibetan areas of China. Our previous studies have demonstrated its hypoglycemic effect. To further explore the underlining molecular mechanism, we investigated the effect of highland barley intervention on liver miRNA expression profiles in diabetic mice. Our results showed that ten differentially expressed miRNA among different groups were identified and their target genes were predicted. Remarkably, many glycometabolism-associated genes, including Foxo3, Nras, Rptor, Igf1r, Tsc2 and Braf, were negatively regulated by miR-122-5p, miR-503-5p, miR-455-5p and miR-210-3p, respectively. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed these target genes were mainly involved in AMPK, MAPK and FOXO signaling pathways. Thereby, these miRNA and mRNA were validated using qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the small RNA-seq and expectations. Highland barley could regulate the MAPK, AMPK, and FOXO signaling pathways by regulating critical miRNA-mRNA pairs, e.x. miR-210-3p-Tsc2/Braf, miR-122-5p-Foxo3, and miR-455-5p-Igf1r, thereby improving blood glucose metabolism in diabetic mice. The present study preliminarily explored the hypoglycaemic effects of highland barley based on transcriptomics, and more detailed and in-depth studies on this topic are needed in the future.",type 2 diabetics
Intestinal glucose excretion: A potential mechanism for glycemic control.,"['ZhigangKe', 'ZongshiLu', 'QingLi', 'WeidongTong']","The gut has been increasingly recognized in recent years as a pivotal organ in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Specifically, the profound and enduring improvement in glucose metabolism achieved through metabolic surgery to modify the anatomy of the gut has prompted scholars to acknowledge that the most effective strategy for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) involves the gut. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of glucose metabolism by the gut encompass gut hormones, bile acids, intestinal gluconeogenesis, gut microbiota, and signaling interactions between the gut and other organs (liver, brain, adipose, etc.). Recent studies have also revealed a novel phenomenon of glucose lowering through the gut: metabolic surgery and metformin promote the excretion of glucose from the circulation into the intestinal lumen by enterocytes. However, there is still limited understanding regarding the underlying mechanisms of intestinal glucose excretion and its contribution to glycemic control. This article reviews current research on intestinal glucose excretion while focusing on its role in T2DM management as well as potential mechanisms.",type 2 diabetics
Fracture patterns in adult onset type 1 diabetes and associated risk factors - A nationwide cohort study.,"['Nicklas HRasmussen', 'Johanna H MDriessen', 'Annika VestergaardKvist', 'Patrick CSouverein', 'Joopvan den Bergh', 'PeterVestergaard']","This study aimed to determine the hazard ratios (HR) for various fracture sites and identify associated risk factors in a cohort of relatively healthy adult people with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (T1D).
The study utilized data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD (1987-2017). Participants included people aged 20 and above with a T1D diagnosis code (n = 3281) and a new prescription for insulin. Controls without diabetes were matched based on sex, year of birth, and practice. Cox regression analysis was conducted to estimate HRs for any fracture, major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs), and peripheral fractures (lower-arm and lower-leg) in people with T1D compared to controls. Risk factors for T1D were examined and included sex, age, diabetic complications, medication usage, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), hypoglycemia, previous fractures, falls, and alcohol consumption. Furthermore, T1D was stratified by duration of disease and presence of microvascular complications.
The proportion of any fracture was higher in T1D (10.8 %) than controls (7.3). Fully adjusted HRs for any fracture (HR: 1.43, CI95%: 1.17-1.74), MOFs (HR: 1.46, CI95%: 1.04-2.05), and lower-leg fractures (HR: 1.37, CI95%: 1.01-1.85) were statistically significantly increased in people with T1D compared to controls. The primary risk factor across all fracture sites in T1D was a previous fracture. Additional risk factors at different sites included previous falls (HR: 1.64, CI95%: 1.17-2.31), antidepressant use (HR: 1.34, CI95%: 1.02-1.76), and anxiolytic use (HR: 1.54, CI95%: 1.08-2.29) for any fracture; being female (HR: 1.65, CI95%: 1.14-2.38) for MOFs; the presence of retinopathy (HR: 1.47, CI95%: 1.02-2.11) and previous falls (HR: 2.04, CI95%: 1.16-3.59) for lower-arm and lower-leg fractures, respectively. Lipid-lowering medication use decreased the risk of MOFs (HR: 0.66, CI95%: 0.44-0.99). Stratification of T1D by disease duration showed that the relative risk of any fracture in T1D did not increase with longer diabetes duration (0-4 years: HR: 1.52, CI95%: 1.23-1.87; 5-9 years: HR: 1.30, CI95%: 0.99-1.71; <10 years: HR: 1.07, CI95%: 0.74-1.55). Similar patterns were observed for other fracture sites. Moreover, the occurrence of microvascular complications in T1D was linked to a heightened risk of fractures in comparison to controls. However, when considering the T1D cohort independently, the association was not statistically significant.
In a cohort of relatively healthy and newly diagnosed people with T1D HRs for any fracture, MOFs, and lower-leg fractures compared to controls were increased. A previous fracture was the most consistent risk factor for a subsequent fracture, whereas retinopathy was the only diabetes related one. We postulate a potential initial fracture risk, succeeded by a subsequent risk reduction, which might potentially increase in later years due to the accumulation of complications and other factors.",type 2 diabetics

Sex-dependent effects of finerenone on hemostasis in normoglycemic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.,"['BielickaNatalia', 'MisztalTomasz', 'ChabielskaEwa', 'Gromotowicz-PopławskaAnna']","Diabetes is associated with aldosterone excess and the overactivation of its mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) which leads to the development of many cardiovascular dysfunctions. Therefore, MR antagonists have been found to exert favorable effects on the cardiovascular system. Finerenone is a new nonsteroidal MR antagonist approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes. Clinical studies have demonstrated that finerenone improves cardiovascular outcomes. However, its influence on hemostasis in the cardioprotective effect is unknown. Therefore, the main aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of finerenone (10 mg/kg, p.o.) on selected hemostasis parameters in streptozotocin (180 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced diabetes. Since regulation of the MR activity is sex-dependent, the study was conducted in both female and male mice. The most beneficial effects of finerenone were observed in diabetic female mice which included a decrease in thrombus formation, attenuation of platelet activity, inhibition of the coagulation system, and activation of fibrinolysis. In contrast, in male diabetic mice only an attenuation of the coagulation system was observed. Furthermore, finerenone also exerted unfavorable effects, but only in normoglycemic mice, manifested as a slight increase in platelet activity in males and an enhancement of the coagulation system activity in females. Our study is the first to show the sex-dependent and glycemia-dependent effects of finerenone on hemostasis in diabetes.

In total, 49 patients with prediabetes and T2DM with good glycemic control were randomly assigned either to receive 2 g/day carnosine or matching placebo. We evaluated endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffness, lipid parameters, blood pressure, heart rate, hepatic and renal outcomes before and after the intervention. Carnosine supplementation had no effect on heart rate, peripheral and central blood pressure, endothelial function (logarithm of reactive hyperemia (LnRHI)), arterial stiffness (carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (CF PWV)), lipid parameters, liver fibroscan indicators, liver transient elastography, liver function tests, and renal outcomes compared to placebo. In conclusion, carnosine supplementation did not improve cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with prediabetes and T2DM with good glycemic control. Therefore, it is improbable that carnosine supplementation would be a viable approach to mitigating the ASCVD risk in these populations. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02917928).",type 2 diabetics
Human Pancreatic Islets React to Glucolipotoxicity by Secreting Pyruvate and Citrate.,"['JohanPerrier', 'MargauxNawrot', 'Anne-MarieMadec', 'KarimChikh', 'Marie-AgnèsChauvin', 'ChristianDamblon', 'JuliaSabatier', 'Charles HThivolet', 'JenniferRieusset', 'Gilles J PRautureau', 'BaptistePanthu']","Progressive decline in pancreatic beta-cell function is central to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we explore the relationship between the beta cell and its nutritional environment, asking how an excess of energy substrate leads to altered energy production and subsequent insulin secretion. Alterations in intracellular metabolic homeostasis are key markers of islets with T2D, but changes in cellular metabolite exchanges with their environment remain unknown. We answered this question using nuclear magnetic resonance-based quantitative metabolomics and evaluated the consumption or secretion of 31 extracellular metabolites from healthy and T2D human islets. Islets were also cultured under high levels of glucose and/or palmitate to induce gluco-, lipo-, and glucolipotoxicity. Biochemical analyses revealed drastic alterations in the pyruvate and citrate pathways, which appear to be associated with mitochondrial oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH) downregulation. We repeated these manipulations on the rat insulinoma-derived beta-pancreatic cell line (INS-1E). Our results highlight an OGDH downregulation with a clear effect on the pyruvate and citrate pathways. However, citrate is directed to lipogenesis in the INS-1E cells instead of being secreted as in human islets. Our results demonstrate the ability of metabolomic approaches performed on culture media to easily discriminate T2D from healthy and functional islets.",type 2 diabetics

Vegan Diets for Children: A Narrative Review of Position Papers Published by Relevant Associations.,"['BoštjanJakše', 'ZlatkoFras', 'NatašaFidler Mis']","The scientific discourse on vegan diets for children and adolescents primarily involves referencing position statement papers from different scientific and professional organizations, including paediatric associations. Over the past two decades, specialized associations have issued official statements and published position papers about adopting well-designed vegan diets during crucial life stages, including pregnancy and lactation, infancy, and childhood. A subset of these associations firmly supports the notion that a well-designed vegan diet can indeed be healthy and support normal growth and development during particularly delicate life stages, emphasizing careful planning, vitamin B12 supplementation, and regular supervised medical and dietetics oversight. In contrast, specific paediatric associations caution against vegan diets for children and adolescents, citing potential harm and the lack of adequate substantiation. These criticisms in position papers frequently point to lower-quality studies and/or outdated studies. Additionally, concerns extend to comparing vegan and omnivorous diets, considering public health issues such as obesity and early stages of cardiovascular disease as well as the risk of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Notably, some scepticism stems from studies where children's adherence to a well-designed vegan diet is incomplete. Scientific rigor suggests performing a comparable assessment of omnivorous and vegan diets. This narrative review highlights the need for a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review to inform balanced perspectives on vegan diets for children and adolescents. Researchers and decision-makers should aim to actively improve the design and consistent implementation of both diet types.",type 2 diabetics

"Epidemiological, Pathophysiological, and Clinical Considerations on the Interplay between Thyroid Disorders and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.","['GregoryGrigoriadis', 'TheocharisKoufakis', 'KalliopiKotsa']","Thyroid disorders (TD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are the two endocrinopathies with the highest prevalence in the general population that frequently coexist. Thyroid dysfunction is more common in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to normoglycemic individuals. Untreated TD can impair glycemic control, increasing the risk of diabetes complications. Hyperinsulinemia can affect the morphology of the thyroid gland by promoting the proliferation of thyroid tissue and increasing the size of thyroid nodules. Metformin can confer benefits in both endocrinopathies, while other antidiabetics, such as sulfonylureas, can negatively affect thyroid function. Animal and human observational data suggest an increased risk of medullary thyroid carcinoma after treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. However, randomized trials have so far been reassuring. Furthermore, some observational studies suggest an association between thyroid cancer and T2DM, especially in women. This narrative review aims to shed light on the epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical aspects of the interplay between TD and T2DM. Taking into account the important clinical implications of the coexistence of T2DM and TD, proper screening and management strategies are needed for both endocrinopathies to ensure optimal patient care.",type 2 diabetics

Serum betatrophin levels were measured with ELISA, and lipoprotein subfractions were analyzed using Lipoprint gel electrophoresis. Betatrophin concentrations were found to be significantly higher in the T2D and NDO groups compared to the controls in all subjects and in females, but not in males. We found significant positive correlations between triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), large LDL (low density lipoprotein), small LDL, high density lipoprotein (HDL) -6-10 subfractions, and betatrophin, while negative correlations were detected between betatrophin and IDL, mean LDL size, and HDL-1-5. Proportion of small HDL was the best predictor of betatrophin in all subjects. Small LDL and large HDL subfractions were found to be the best predictors in females, while in males, VLDL was found to be the best predictor of betatrophin.

Glucose Transport and Utilization in the Hippocampus: From Neurophysiology to Diabetes-Related Development of Dementia.,"['Caio YogiYonamine', 'Maria Luiza EstimoMichalani', 'Rafael JungesMoreira', 'Ubiratan FabresMachado']","The association of diabetes with cognitive dysfunction has at least 60 years of history, which started with the observation that children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), who had recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia and consequently low glucose supply to the brain, showed a deficit of cognitive capacity. Later, the growing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and dementia in aged populations revealed their high association, in which a reduced neuronal glucose supply has also been considered as a key mechanism, despite hyperglycemia. Here, we discuss the role of glucose in neuronal functioning/preservation, and how peripheral blood glucose accesses the neuronal intracellular compartment, including the exquisite glucose flux across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the complex network of glucose transporters, in dementia-related areas such as the hippocampus. In addition, insulin resistance-induced abnormalities in the hippocampus of obese/T2D patients, such as inflammatory stress, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial stress, increased generation of advanced glycated end products and BBB dysfunction, as well as their association with dementia/Alzheimer's disease, are addressed. Finally, we discuss how these abnormalities are accompained by the reduction in the expression and translocation of the high capacity insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 in hippocampal neurons, which leads to neurocytoglycopenia and eventually to cognitive dysfunction. This knowledge should further encourage investigations into the beneficial effects of promising therapeutic approaches which could improve central insulin sensitivity and GLUT4 expression, to fight diabetes-related cognitive dysfunctions.",type 2 diabetics
The Role of Insulin-like Growth Factor I in Mechanisms of Resilience and Vulnerability to Sporadic Alzheimer's Disease.,"['Jonathan AZegarra-Valdivia', 'JaimePignatelli', 'AngelNuñez', 'IgnacioTorres Aleman']","Despite decades of intense research, disease-modifying therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still very much needed. Apart from the extensively analyzed tau and amyloid pathological cascades, two promising avenues of research that may eventually identify new druggable targets for AD are based on a better understanding of the mechanisms of resilience and vulnerability to this condition. We argue that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) activity in the brain provides a common substrate for the mechanisms of resilience and vulnerability to AD. We postulate that preserved brain IGF-I activity contributes to resilience to AD pathology as this growth factor intervenes in all the major pathological cascades considered to be involved in AD, including metabolic impairment, altered proteostasis, and inflammation, to name the three that are considered to be the most important ones. Conversely, disturbed IGF-I activity is found in many AD risk factors, such as old age, type 2 diabetes, imbalanced diet, sedentary life, sociality, stroke, stress, and low education, whereas the Apolipoprotein (Apo) E4 genotype and traumatic brain injury may also be influenced by brain IGF-I activity. Accordingly, IGF-I activity should be taken into consideration when analyzing these processes, while its preservation will predictably help prevent the progress of AD pathology. Thus, we need to define IGF-I activity in all these conditions and develop a means to preserve it. However, defining brain IGF-I activity cannot be solely based on humoral or tissue levels of this neurotrophic factor, and new functionally based assessments need to be developed.",type 2 diabetics

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a representative of OPs, chlorpyrifos (CPF), on viability, proliferation, differentiation, and fatty acid uptake in 3T3-L1 cells. The effect of CPF exposure on preadipocyte proliferation was examined by the MTT, NR, and BrdU assays. The impact of CPF exposure on the differentiation of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes was evaluated by Oil Red O staining and RT-qPCR. The effect of CPF on free fatty acid uptake in adipocytes was assessed with the fluorescent dye BODIPY. Our experiments demonstrated that exposure to CPF decreased the viability of 3T3-L1 cells; however, it was increased when the cells were exposed to low concentrations of the pesticide. Exposure to CPF inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. CPF exposure resulted in decreased lipid accumulation, accompanied by down-regulation of the two key transcription factors in adipogenesis: C/EBPα and PPARγ. Exposure to CPF increased basal free fatty acid uptake in fully differentiated adipocytes but decreased this uptake when CPF was added during the differentiation process. Increased free fatty acid accumulation in fully differentiated adipocytes may suggest that CPF leads to adipocyte hypertrophy, one of the mechanisms leading to obesity, particularly in adults. It can therefore be concluded that CPF may disturb the activity of preadipocytes and adipocytes, although the role of this pesticide in the development of obesity requires further research.",type 2 diabetics

Although it is well known that systemic chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are primarily involved in the development of ED, recent studies have shown that perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) is implicated in its pathogenesis, also contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis and to insulin resistance (IR). In this review, we describe the relationship between PVAT and ED, and we also analyse the role of PVAT in the pathogenesis of CVDs and T2DM, further assessing its potential therapeutic target with the aim of restoring normal ED and reducing global cardiovascular risk.",type 2 diabetics

Less clear is the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and chronic complications and conditions frequently associated with it. This review summarizes recent evidence on the role of dopamine in regulating insular metabolism and activity, the pathophysiology of traditional chronic complications associated with T2D, the pathophysiological interconnection between T2D and chronic neurological and psychiatric disorders characterized by impaired dopamine activity/metabolism, and therapeutic implications. Reinforcing dopamine signaling is therapeutic in T2D, especially in patients with dopamine-related disorders, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, addictions, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. On the other hand, although specific trials are probably needed, certain medications approved for T2D (e.g., metformin, pioglitazone, incretin-based therapy, and gliflozins) may have a therapeutic role in such dopamine-related disorders due to anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, improvement in insulin signaling, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy, and apoptosis, restoration of striatal dopamine synthesis, and modulation of dopamine signaling associated with reward and hedonic eating.

Anti-diabetic drugs reduce hyperglycemia, yet their effect on cognitive improvement is unknown. We aimed to investigate the effect of anti-diabetic drugs regulating BDNF in T2DM through computational and case-control study design. We obtained T2DMproteins viatext-mining to construct a T2DMprotein network. From the T2DMnetwork, the metformin and glimepiride interactomes and their crucial shortest-path-stimulating BDNF were identified. Using qRTPCR, the genes encoding the shortest-path proteins were assessed in four groups (untreated-T2DM, metformin-treated, glimepiride-treated, and healthy controls). Finally, ELISA was used to assess serum BDNF levels to validate drug efficacy. As a result of this investigation, aT2DMnetwork was constructed with 3683 text-mined proteins. Then, the T2DMnetwork was explored to generate a metformin and glimepiride interactome that establishes the critical shortest-path for BDNF stimulation. Metformin stimulates BDNF via APP binding to the PRKAB1 receptor. Whereas, glimepiride increases BDNF by binding to KCNJ11 via AP2M1 and ESR1 proteins. Both drug shortest-path encoding genes differed significantly between the groups. Unlike metformin, BDNF gene and protein expression rise significantly with glimepiride. Overall, glimepiride can effectively increase BDNF, which could benefit T2DM patients with cognitive deterioration.",type 2 diabetics

The Negative Impact of Insulin Resistance/Hyperinsulinemia on Chronic Heart Failure and the Potential Benefits of Its Screening and Treatment.,"['SerafinoFazio', 'ValentinaMercurio', 'FloraAffuso', 'PaoloBellavite']","This opinion article highlights the potential alterations caused by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia on the cardiovascular system and their negative impact on heart failure (HF), and describes the potential benefits of an early screening with consequent prompt treatment. HF is the final event of several different cardiovascular diseases. Its incidence has been increasing over the last decades because of increased survival from ischemic heart disease thanks to improvements in its treatment (including myocardial revascularization interventions) and the increase in life span. In particular, incidence of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is significantly increasing, and patients with HFpEF often are also affected by diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance (IR), with a prevalence > 45%. Concentric left ventricular (LV) remodeling and diastolic dysfunction are the main structural abnormalities that characterize HFpEF. It is well documented in the literature that IR with chronic hyperinsulinemia, besides causing type 2 diabetes mellitus, can cause numerous cardiovascular alterations, including endothelial dysfunction and increased wall thicknesses of the left ventricle with concentric remodeling and diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, it is conceivable that IR might play a major role in the pathophysiology and the progressive worsening of HF. To date, several substances have been shown to reduce IR/hyperinsulinemia and have beneficial clinical effects in patients with HF, including SGLT2 inhibitors, metformin, and berberine. For this reason, an early screening of IR could be advisable in subjects at risk and in patients with heart failure, to promptly intervene with appropriate therapy. Future studies aimed at comparing the efficacy of the substances used both alone and in association are needed.",type 2 diabetics

Caudal regression syndrome type 1 with minimally invasive computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging autopsy: a case report.,"['MiraAyoub', 'ChanaeDixon', 'Sharon EByrd', 'Rakhee MBowker']","Caudal regression syndrome is a rare complex congenital anomaly with reduced penetrance and phenotypic variability characterized by osseous defects of the caudal spine, lower limb anomalies, and accompanying genitourinary, gastrointestinal/anorectal, and cardiac system soft tissue defects. We report a rare presentation of type 1 caudal regression syndrome in a pregnant woman with preexisting diabetes, in which early recognition of severe fetal anomalies on routine antenatal ultrasound facilitated confirmation with fetal magnetic resonance imaging to characterize extent of disease and prognosticate fetal outcome.
This case of type 1 caudal regression syndrome in the setting of maternal pregestational diabetes mellitus resulted in stillbirth. The mother was a 29-year-old Caucasian primigravida female with past medical history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes managed with metformin prior to pregnancy, prompting admission for glucose management and initiation of insulin at 13 weeks. Baseline hemoglobin A1c was high at 8.0%. Fetal ultrasound at 22 weeks was notable for severe sacral agenesis, bilateral renal pelvis dilatation, single umbilical artery, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging at 29 weeks showed absent lower two-thirds of the spine with corresponding spinal cord abnormality compatible with type 1 caudal regression syndrome. The mother delivered a male stillborn at 39 and 3/7 weeks. Minimally invasive postmortem magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography autopsy were performed to confirm clinical findings when family declined conventional autopsy. Etiology of sacral agenesis was attributed to poorly controlled maternal diabetes early in gestation.
Maternal preexisting diabetes is a known risk factor for development of congenital malformations. This rare case of type 1 caudal regression syndrome in a mother with preexisting diabetes with elevated hemoglobin A1c highlights the importance of preconception glycemic control in diabetic women and the utility of fetal magnetic resonance imaging for confirmation of ultrasound findings to permit accurate prognostication. Additionally, minimally invasive postmortem magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography autopsy can facilitate diagnostic confirmation of clinical findings in perinatal death due to complex congenital anomalies while limiting the emotional burden on bereaved family members who decline conventional autopsy.",type 2 diabetics

Diabetes that is uncontrolled for an extended period of time is linked to substantial comorbidities and organ damage. The purpose of the current study is to assess the effect of coadministration of omega-3 fatty acids with glimepiride on blood glucose, lipid profile, serum irisin, and sirtuin-1 levels in T2DM patients.
This clinical trial involved 70 type 2 diabetic patients randomly assigned to glimepiride 3 mg with either omega-3 capsules contained fish oil 1000 mg, 13% of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 9% docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (omega-3 group, n = 35) or placebo capsules contained corn oil and linoleic acid (control group, n = 35) daily for three months. Blood samples were obtained at the start of the study and 12 weeks later for biochemical examination of HbA1c%, FBG, fasting insulin, and lipid profile. In addition, the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) was calculated. Human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits were utilized for assessing serum irisin and sirtuin-1 levels before and after the intervention.
Compared to the control group, omega-3 fatty acids decreased serum fasting blood glucose (FBG, p < 0.001), glycated hemoglobin percent (HbA1C%, p < 0.001), total cholesterol (TC, p < 0.001), triglycerides (TGs, p = 0.006), low density lipoprotein (LDL, p = 0.089), and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR, p = 0.021) after three months of intervention.

However, there is currently no standardized treatment or drug for MAFLD. In this study, A MAFLD animal model through a high-fat diet (HFD) along with administration of streptozotocin (STZ), and palmitic acid (PA)-induced AML12 cells were treated by puerarin. The objective of this study was to assess the therapeutic effect of puerarin, a flavonoid substance that possesses various pharmacological properties, on MAFLD. The results showed that puerarin administration enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, while also mitigating liver dysfunction and hyperlipidemia in MAFLD mice. Moreover, puerarin attenuated oxidative stress levels and inflammation in the liver. Transmission electron microscopy and Western blot analysis indicated that puerarin inhibited ferroptosis in vivo. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that puerarin upregulated SIRT1 expression, increased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) protein levels, and facilitated translocation into the nucleus. The protective effect of puerarin on PA-induced AML12 cells was diminished by the utilization of EX-527 (a SIRT1 inhibitor) and Nrf2 siRNA. Overall, the results demonstrate that puerarin ameliorates MAFLD by suppressing ferroptosis and inflammation via the SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway.

Efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"['YanYang', 'JingjingYan', 'ShuoLi', 'MengruLiu', 'RuiminHan', 'YinpingWang', 'ZhenWang', 'DefengWang']","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the common metabolic diseases worldwide, and studies have found significant differences in the composition and ratio of intestinal flora between patients with T2DM and normal glucose tolerance, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may modulate the composition of the intestinal microbiota thereby alleviating the hyperglycemic state. We conducted a meta-analysis and systematic review of existing randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the efficacy of FMT in T2DM.
We conducted a computer search of PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to screen randomized controlled trials studies on FMT treatment for T2DM and extracted data from studies that met inclusion criteria. RevMan 5.4 software and Stata 11 software was used for meta-analysis. The indexes of Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial blood glucose (PBG), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), body mass index (BMI), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Transaminase (ALT), Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were mainly evaluated after FMT treatment of T2DM patients, and the changes of intestinal flora were evaluated.
Four RCTs met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis showed that compared with the non-FMT group, FMT combined treatment could significantly reduce the PBG level in patients with type 2 diabetes (MD = -0.51, 95% CI: -1.42-0.40, P = 0.27). Compared with single FMT treatment, FMT combined treatment could reduce TG levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (MD = -0.60, 95% CI: -1.12~-0.07, P = 0.03). The levels of TG (MD = -0.26, 95% CI: -0.51~-0.02, P = 0.03), HOMA-IR (MD = -2.73, 95% CI: -4.71~0.75, P = 0.007) and HDL (MD = -0.06,95% CI: -0.10~-0.02, P = 0.003) were significantly decreased after treatment in the single FMT group. The level of TC (MD = -0.65, 95% CI: -1.00~-0.31, P = 0.0002) was significantly decreased after FMT combined treatment. Compared with before treatment, ALT (MD = -2.52, 95% CI: -3.86~-1.17, P = 0.0002) and DBP (MD = -2, 95% CI: -3.32~0.68, P = 0.003) levels decreased after treatment in the single FMT group and the FMT combined group. FPG (MD = -0.94, 95% CI: -1.86~-0.02, P = 0.04), TG (MD = -0.73, 95% CI: -1.42~-0.04, P = 0.04) and TC (MD = -0.94, 95% CI: -1.45~-0.43, P = 0.0003) were significantly decreased after combined drug and diet therapy. Secondly, FMT can promote the colonization and growth of donor-related flora in patients with type 2 diabetes.
In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, FMT treatment can reduce the levels of PBG, TG, HOMA-IR, TC, ALT, and DBP, especially in the combined treatment regimen. In addition, FMT can reshape the intestinal flora and establish the balance of dominant flora.",type 2 diabetics

The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of newly diagnosed hyperglycemia and diabetes among COVID-19 survivors and to evaluate whether obesity and lipid profile have an effect on this group using the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP).
In the retrospective study, 511 adults with a previously diagnosed ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2"" who admitted to COVID-19 follow-up outpatient clinic were evaluated. Data was collected on patient demographics, comorbidities, and some laboratory results. Logistic regression was used to estimate associated factors.
Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was defined in 17 patients (3.32%), hyperglycemia in 86 patients (16.82%). The results of analysis were examined, gender, age, BMI and triglyceride variables were found to be significant risk factors together.

Undiagnosed-preexisting DM in 4 out of 17 patients diagnosed with T2DM at their first visit and in 7 out of 8 hyperglycemia patients diagnosed with T2DM at the end of six-month follow-up.
COVID-19, may directly/indirectly, predispose to hyperglycemia. Obesity and hyperlipidemia are risk factors for newly diagnosed T2DM/hyperglycemia in post-COVID-19 syndrome patients. Since that some metabolic variables were found to be significantly higher in the group with high AIP values, we suggest that AIP might be used as a reference to predict the development of obesity and T2DM.",type 2 diabetics

We enrolled 2,217 participants with varying degrees of glucose levels (normal range, and prediabetes and T2D ranges), using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) over 28 days to capture glucose patterns. Participants logged food intake, physical activity, and body weight via a smartphone app that integrated wearables data and provided daily insights, including overlaying glucose patterns with activity and food intake, macronutrient breakdown, glycemic index (GI), glycemic load (GL), and activity measures. The app furthermore provided personalized recommendations based on users' preferences, goals, and observed glycemic patterns. Users could interact with the app for an additional 2 months without CGM. Here we report significant improvements in hyperglycemia, glucose variability, and hypoglycemia, particularly in those who were not diabetic at baseline. Body weight decreased in all groups, especially those who were overweight or obese. Healthy eating habits improved significantly, with reduced daily caloric intake and carbohydrate-to-calorie ratio and increased intake of protein, fiber, and healthy fats relative to calories. These findings suggest that lifestyle recommendations, in addition to behavior logging and CGM data integration within a mobile app, can enhance the metabolic health of both nondiabetic and T2D individuals, leading to healthier lifestyle choices. This technology can be a valuable tool for T2D prevention and treatment.",type 2 diabetics

Hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation increase in FST levels adjusted for multiple risk factors was 1.05 (95%CI: 1.00-1.11, p = 0.036) for mortality; 1.10 (95%CI: 1.00-1.20, p = 0.042) for stroke; 1.13 (95%CI: 1.03-1.25, p = 0.014) for ischemic stroke; 1.16 (95%CI: 1.03-1.30, p = 0.015) for HF; and 1.38 (95%CI: 1.12-1.70, p = 0.003) for a diagnosis of CKD. In MDC-CC individuals without prevalent or incident diabetes, the association between FST and stroke, CE and CKD remained significant; but not with mortality or HF.
Elevated circulating FST associates with an increased risk of mortality and HF, which partly may be mediated by diabetes. FST also associated with stroke, ischemic stroke, CE and CKD, independently of established risk factors including diabetes.",type 2 diabetics
"Habitual intake of iron, copper, and zinc and the risk of type 2 diabetes in a prospective cohort: The CAVAS (Cardiovascular Disease Association Study).","['Min-JiKim', 'Hye WonWoo', 'Min-HoShin', 'Sang BaekKoh', 'Hyeon ChangKim', 'Yu-MiKim', 'Mi KyungKim']","Unlike iron, evidence of the association between dietary copper and zinc intake and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk is limited. This study aimed to examine the prospective associations of dietary intake of iron (total, plant-based, and animal-based), copper, and zinc with T2D risk among adults aged ≥40 years.
For 16,666 participants, dietary intakes (baseline, cumulative average, and most recent) of iron, copper, and zinc were calculated from repeated food frequency questionnaires; a modified Poisson regression model with a robust error estimator was conducted. In men, positive associations between T2D and baseline dietary intake of Cu and Zn, cumulative average dietary intake of Fe (total and animal-based), Cu and Zn, and most recent dietary intake of Fe (total, plant-based, and animal-based), Cu, and Zn [most recent diet: for total Fe, IRR(95%CI) = 1.93 (1.41-2.64); for plant-based Fe, 1.56 (1.15-2.11); for animal-based Fe, 1.44 (1.09-1.90); for Cu, 3.17 (2.33-4.30); for Zn, 2.18 (1.64-2.89)] were observed, where as in women, there were positive associations of only cumulative average dietary Zn intake and most recent dietary intake of plant-based Fe, Cu, and Zn [most recent diet: for plant-based Fe, 1.30 (1.01-1.68); for Cu, 1.62 (1.27-2.08); for Zn, 2.07 (1.61-2.66)].
Dietary intakes of iron (total, plant-based, and animal-based), copper, and zinc may be positively associated with T2D risk. These positive associations are predominantly observed in most recent diet and appear to be stronger compared to baseline and cumulative average diet.",type 2 diabetics
Factors contributing to whether or not people with obesity undergo bariatric surgery.,"['Chi-WhanChoi', 'DanielCunha', 'ChristineHelfrich', 'Simone VGill']","Bariatric surgery has been suggested as a safe and effective way to treat obesity by facilitating weight loss, but factors that predict the likelihood of bariatric surgery are unknown. The objective of this study was to describe factors associated with individuals with obesity that influence their decision to undergo bariatric surgery.
The study design was a cross-sectional study and participants were recruited via a survey link posted on the Obesity Action Coalition website. Demographic data, medical data, weight loss program data, and reports of personal experiences were gathered via an online survey. A multivariate logistic regression model was conducted to examine predictors associated with bariatric surgery (N = 4192).
Participants who took phentermine (OR=2.983), Phentermine-topiramate (Qsymia) (OR=2.863), Naltrexone-bupropion (Contrave) (OR=3.246), or Liraglutide (Saxenda) (OR=2.144) had a higher likelihood of undergoing bariatric surgery for weight loss. Participants with type 2 diabetes (OR=1.728), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (OR=1.489), or COVID-19 (OR=3.852) had a higher likelihood of undergoing bariatric surgery while sleep apnea (OR=0.760) was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving surgery. Those who used MyFitnessPal™ (OR=2.232), Noom™ (OR=1.400), Jenny Craig™ (OR=1.533), or Keto (OR=1.664) for weight loss had a higher likelihood of obtaining bariatric surgery. Personal trauma experiences of sexual abuse (OR=1.982) and physical abuse (OR=1.490) were more associated with participants who underwent surgery.
A variety of characteristics were associated with decisions to undergo bariatric surgery. These findings may help to determine ways to support individuals who are considering bariatric surgery.",type 2 diabetics
Association between preterm delivery and subsequent maternal risk of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus in a UK population-based retrospective cohort study.,"['AmiSong', 'KelvinOkoth', 'Nicola JAdderley']","Women with a history of preterm delivery (PTD) are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD) later in life. However, it is not well established whether PTD is associated with CVD risk factors, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, in this study, we examined the associations between PTD compared with term delivery and subsequent risk of hypertension and T2DM.
Retrospective matched population-based open cohort study.
Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD data in the UK.
A total of 3335 18-49-year-old women with preterm delivery were matched by age and region to 12 634 without a record of preterm delivery.
Outcomes of interest were newly diagnosed hypertension or T2DM at least 6 months after delivery. During the study period (January 2000-December 2019), hypertension or T2DM events in the medical records of women with (exposed) and without (unexposed) preterm delivery were compared. HR and 95% CI were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for potential confounders.
Over a median follow-up period of 5.11 (IQR 2.15-9.56) years, the HRs for hypertension in women who delivered preterm compared with women who delivered at term were 1.42 (95%CI 1.09 to 1.80) and 1.18 (95%CI 0.90 to 1.56) in the unadjusted and adjusted models, respectively. For T2DM, over a median follow-up period of 5.17 (IQR 2.18-9.67) years, the HRs in women who delivered preterm compared with those who delivered at term were 1.67 (95%CI 1.12 to 2.48) and 1.10 (95%CI 0.72 to 1.68) in the unadjusted and adjusted models, respectively.
We found no independent effect of preterm delivery on risk of hypertension or type 2 diabetes in this study. While significant associations were observed in unadjusted analyses, associations were lost after adjustment and may be attributable to other reproductive complications. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.",type 2 diabetics
Association of RARRES2 rs17173608 Gene Polymorphism and Serum Chemerin with Acute Myocardial Infarction and Its Risk Factors: A Case-Control Study in an Iranian Population.,"['VanousheAzimi Pirsaraei', 'HadiKhodabandehloo', 'MirAli Mousavi', 'MinaZhiani', 'ShadiNazari', 'MojtabaFathi']","The adipokine Chemerin and the retinoic acid receptor responder 2 (RARRES2) gene have been associated with an increased incidence of obesity, insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. The impact of RARRES2 rs17173608 gene polymorphism on acute myocardial infarction and Chemerin levels has not yet been entirely elucidated. This study aimed to assess the association of RARRES2 rs17173608 gene polymorphism and serum Chemerin with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and its risk factors in an Iranian population.
In this case-control study, 134 AMI patients and 100 healthy controls were recruited from tertiary referral hospitals in Zanjan, Iran. Whole blood samples were collected for DNA extraction and Chemerin level determination. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify plasma levels of Chemerin. Tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction and agarose gel electrophoresis techniques were used to detect gene polymorphism of Chemerin rs17173608 from DNA samples.
Serum Chemerin levels were higher in the control group than in the AMI group. However, after adjusting for age, sex, and other risk factors, there was no significant association between serum Chemerin level and AMI occurrence. In the genotype analysis, 21.6% of patients had the TT genotype, and 78.4% had the TG genotype. The GG genotype was not detected in any patient. The genotype distribution of the healthy control group was 19.0% TT genotype, 80.0% TG genotype, and 1.0% GG genotype. Serum Chemerin levels in participants with TG genotype were statistically different between case and control groups.
Serum Chemerin levels and RARRES2 rs17173608 gene polymorphism were not correlated with AMI occurrence after adjusting for AMI risk factors in Iranian patients. More research with a larger sample size and diverse ethnicities is needed to corroborate our findings.",type 2 diabetics
"Glucagon fill rates and cost among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in the United States, 2011-2021.","['Tyler JBenning', 'Herbert CHeien', 'Joseph RHerges', 'Ana LCreo', 'AlaaAl Nofal', 'Rozalina GMcCoy']","To characterize glucagon fill rates and costs among youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
Claims-based analysis of commercially-insured youth with T1DM included in OptumLabs® Data Warehouse between 2011 and 2021. Glucagon fill rates and costs were calculated overall and by formulation (injectable, intranasal, autoinjector, and pre-filled syringe). Sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with glucagon fills were examined using Cox regression.
We identified 13,267 children with T1DM (76.4% non-Hispanic White). Over mean follow-up of 2.81 years (SD 2.62), 70.0% filled glucagon, with stable fill rates from 2011 to 2021. Intranasal glucagon had rapid uptake following initial approval, and it accounted for almost half (46.6%) of all glucagon fills by 2021. Family income was positively associated with glucagon fills in a stepwise fashion (HR 1.39 [95% CI 1.27-1.52] for annual household income ≥$200,000 vs. <$40,000), while Black race was negatively associated with fills (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.76-0.91]) compared to White race). Annual mean out-of-pocket costs ranged from $21-$68 (IQR $29-$44).
Roughly 30% of commercially-insured youth with T1DM may lack access to unexpired glucagon, with significant disparities among Black and low-income patients. Health systems, clinicians, schools, and caregivers should work together to ensure children have reliable access to this critical medication.",type 2 diabetics
Association between frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"['XiaoyanSun', 'XianghaiZhou', 'ShaoboLi', 'LinongJi']","To determine the association between the frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
The retrospective study analyzed data from 3,630 patients with type 2 diabetes who were enrolled between August 2020 and July 2021. 2456 non-insulin-treated patients were divided into SMBG ≤6 times/week and >6 times/week groups. 1174 insulin-treated patients were divided into SMBG ≤9 times/week and >9 times/week groups. Propensity score matching was used to generate groups with well-balanced covariates. Primary outcomes were changes in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial blood glucose (PBG) from baseline to 6 months.
In the non-insulin-treated group, a comparison in FBG and PBG reduction between the SMBG >6 times/week and ≤6 times/week groups was statistically significant (-0.59 vs. -0.18 mmol/l, P < 0.001; -0.91 vs. -0.36 mmol/l, P < 0.001). In the insulin-treated group, there was no statistically significant reduction in FBG or PBG, patients with baseline FBG >8 or 9 mmol/l and SMBG >9 times/week had a significant FBG reduction than the ≤9 times/week group.
Frequent SMBG was associated with better glycemic control in non-insulin-treated patients. Insulin-treated patients with poor glycemic control may benefit from frequent SMBG.",type 2 diabetics

We included in the SR with MA only RCTs with at least 24-month follow-up found in Medline, Cochrane Library, Embase, and LiSSA between January 2008 to September 2022 comparing DR post-MT versus post-MS. We calculated relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects approach to examine differences in DR between patients allocated to MS versus MT.
. DR was significantly higher in MS versus MT after 36 months' follow-up in patients with obesity (RR=6.65 [95%CI 2.24;19.79]; I² = 27%; 5 trials, 404 patients), but also specifically in patients with class I obesity (RR=5.27 [1.31;21.23]; I²=0%; 4 trials, 80 patients).

Nrf2 inhibition regulates intracellular lipid accumulation in mouse insulinoma cells and improves insulin secretory function.,"['AlpanaMukhuty', 'SamanwitaMandal', 'ChandraniFouzder', 'SnehasisDas', 'DipanjanChattopadhyay', 'TanmayMajumdar', 'RakeshKundu']","High amount of fat in the pancreas is linked to poor functioning of β-cells and raises the risk of type 2 diabetes. Here we report the putative role of a circulatory glycoprotein Fetuin-A, a known obesity marker, in promoting lipid accumulation in β-cells and its association with Fatty acid translocase/CD36 for lipid storage culminate in β-cell dysfunction. Additionally, this work reveals regulation of CD36 via Nrf2, a key regulator of oxidative stress, and reduction of lipid accumulation by suppression of Nrf2 that restores β-cell function. Palmitate (0.50 mM) and Fetuin-A (100 μg/mL) exposure showed high levels of intracellular lipid in MIN6 (mouse insulinoma cells) with a concomitant decrease in insulin secretion. This also increased the expression of important lipogenic factors, like CD36, PGC1α, PPARγ, and SREBP1. Flow cytometry analysis of CD36 membrane localization has been corroborated with an increased accumulation of lipids as indicated by Oil-Red-O staining. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence of Nrf2 indicated its high expression in palmitate-fetuin-A incubation and translocation in the nucleus. Suppression of Nrf2 by siRNA showed a reduced expression of lipogenic genes, ablation of lipid droplets, decrease in the number of apoptotic cells, and restoration of insulin secretion with a corresponding increase of Pdx1, BETA2, and Ins1 gene expression. Our study thus suggested an important aspect of lipid accumulation in the pancreatic β-cells contributing to β-cell dysfunction and demonstrated the role of Fetuin-A in CD36 expression, with a possible way of restoring β-cell function by targeting Nrf2.",type 2 diabetics

This study aims to investigate the epidemiological trend of laryngeal cancer with updated data on the global distribution of the disease burden.
The incidence and mortality rate of laryngeal cancer was extracted from GLOBOCAN (2020), Cancer Incidence in Five Continents series I-X, WHO mortality database, the Nordic Cancer Registries, and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program. The Global Health data exchanges for the prevalence of its associated risk factors. A Joinpoint regression analysis was used to calculate Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC).
The age-standardised rate (ASR) of laryngeal cancer incidence and mortality were 2.0 and 1.0 per 100,000 worldwide. The Caribbean (ASR = 4.0) and Central and Eastern Europe (ASR = 3.6) had the highest incidence and mortality rate. Incidence and risk factors associated with laryngeal cancer included tobacco usage, alcohol consumption, poor diet, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and lipid disorders. There was an overall decreasing trend in incidence, especially for males, but an increasing incidence was observed in female populations and younger subjects.
As overall global trends of laryngeal cancer have been decreasing, especially for the male population, this could possibly be attributed to reduced tobacco use and alcohol consumption. Decrease in mortality may be due to improved diagnostic methods and accessibility to treatment, yet disparity in trend remains potentially because of differences in the level of access to surgical care. Disparities in temporal trends across countries may require further research and exploration to determine other underlying factors influencing this.",type 2 diabetics

Left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction is an early and important manifestation of preserved ejection fraction heart failure. The onset of heart failure in persons with diabetes is associated with diabetic neuropathy. However, the relationship among sudomotor function, which is an early manifestation of small fiber neuropathy, and LV diastolic function remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the association between sudomotor function and LV diastolic function in persons with T2DM.
In total, 699 persons with T2DM were enrolled and divided into three groups according to electrochemical skin conductance (ESC) assessed using the SUDOSCAN device: ""no dysfunction"" group (NSF), ""moderate dysfunction"" group (MDF), and ""severe dysfunction"" group (SDF). LV diastolic function was assessed using Doppler echocardiography. To evaluate the relationship between ESC and echocardiographic parameters, Pearson's correlation analysis was performed. Additionally, logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between LV diastolic function and ESC. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate the performance of sudomotor function indicators in detecting impaired cardiac diastolic function.
There were 301 persons (43.06%) in the NSF group, 232 (33.19%) in the MDF group, and 166 (23.75%) in the SDF group. Compared to the NSF group, the MDF and SDF groups had higher A and E/e' and lower e' values (all p < 0.05). Pearson's correlation analysis showed that A and E/e' were negatively associated with foot ESC (FESC) and hand ESC (HESC), whereas e' was positively associated with FESC and HESC (all p < 0.05). After adjusting for confounding factors, binary logistic regression analysis showed that ESC was independently associated with impaired LV diastolic function (p = 0.003). The area under the ROC curve values for FESC and HESC were 0.621 and 0.635, respectively (both p < 0.05).
Deteriorating sudomotor function was associated with reduced diastolic function indicators. ESC can be used as a biomarker for detecting LV diastolic impairment.",type 2 diabetics

Genetics and epigenetics of diabetes and its complications in India.,"['AnkitaPriyadarshini', 'RiyaMadan', 'SadhanDas']","Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become a significant health concern with an increasing rate of morbidity and mortality worldwide. India ranks second in the number of diabetes cases in the world. The increasing burden of DM can be explained by genetic predisposition of Indians to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) coupled with rapid urbanization and socio-economic development in the last 3 decades leading to drastic changes in lifestyle. Environment and lifestyle changes contribute to T2DM development by altering epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications, and long non-coding RNAs, all of which regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. Although the genetic predisposition of Indians to T2DM is well established, how environmental and genetic factors interact and lead to T2DM is not well understood. In this review, we discuss the prevalence of diabetes and its complications across different states in India and how various risk factors contribute to its pathogenesis. The review also highlights the role of genetic predisposition among the Indian population and epigenetic factors involved in the etiology of diabetes. Lastly, we review current treatments and emphasize the knowledge gap with respect to genetic and epigenetic factors in the Indian context. Further understanding of the genetic and epigenetic determinants will help in risk prediction and prevention as well as therapeutic interventions, which will improve the clinical management of diabetes and associated macro- and micro-vascular complications.",type 2 diabetics

Neuraminidase-induced externalization of phosphatidylserine activates ADAM17 and impairs insulin signaling in endothelial cells.,"['LarissaFerreira-Santos', 'Francisco IRamirez-Perez', 'Christopher AFoote', 'Marc AAugenreich', 'Neil JMcMillan', 'Morgan BWilliams', 'Juan DGonzalez-Vallejo', 'GavinPower', 'Andrew AWheeler', 'CamilaManrique-Acevedo', 'Luis AMartinez-Lemus', 'JaumePadilla']","Endothelial insulin resistance represents a causal factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and vascular disease, thus the need to identify molecular mechanisms underlying defects in endothelial insulin signaling. We previously have shown that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) is increased while insulin receptor α-subunit (IRα) is decreased in the vasculature of patients with T2D, leading to impaired insulin-induced vasodilation. We have also demonstrated that ADAM17 sheddase activity targets IRα; however, the mechanisms driving endothelial ADAM17 activity in T2D are largely unknown. Herein, we report that externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane causes ADAM17-mediated shedding of IRα and blunting of insulin signaling in endothelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endothelial PS externalization is mediated by the phospholipid scramblase anoctamin-6 (ANO6) and that this process can be stimulated by neuraminidase, a soluble enzyme that cleaves sialic acid residues. Of note, we demonstrate that men and women with T2D display increased levels of neuraminidase activity in plasma, relative to age-matched healthy individuals, and this occurs in conjunction with increased ADAM17 activity and impaired leg blood flow responses to endogenous insulin. Collectively, this work reveals the neuraminidase-ANO6-ADAM17 axis as a novel potential target for restoring endothelial insulin sensitivity in T2D.",type 2 diabetics
Affected brother as the highest risk factor of type 1 diabetes development in children and adolescents: One center data before implementing type 1 diabetes national screening.,"['AnnaWędrychowicz', 'TeresaGrzelak', 'AlicjaPietraszek', 'MariaSkrzyszowska', 'MariMinasjan', 'Jerzy BStarzyk']","There is an increased risk for childhood type 1 diabetes (T1D) when T1D and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are reported in relatives.
Our objective was to evaluate current family risk factors for T1D development before implementing a national screening program for T1D.
A population of 879 Caucasian children and adolescents with T1D and 286 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. All participants completed the same questionnaire, which collected information about family history of diabetes over 3 generations. In statistical analyses, frequency tables and χ2 tests evaluated possible multicollinearity among risk factors that were significantly associated with the outcomes.
Family history of diabetes was more frequent in controls (n = 75, 26.2%) than in patients with T1D (n = 146, 16.6%, odds ratio (OR) = 1.785, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.299-2.452, degrees of freedom (df) = 12.976, p = 0.004), especially with a family history of T2D (n = 62, 21.7% compared to n = 79, 9.0%, respectively, OR = 2.803, 95% CI: 1.948-4.034, df = 32.669, p < 0.001). Also, there was a tendency for the nuclear family of T1D patients to be more frequently affected by T1D (n = 74, 8.4%) than the controls (n = 15, 5.2%, OR = 1.605, 95% CI: 0.937-2.751, df = 3.081, p = 0.079). The risk of T1D was associated with the closest family members being affected and accelerated over generations. Indeed, it was highest in siblings, especially brothers (OR = 12.985, 95% CI: 0.782-215.743, Fisher's test: p < 0.001). A positive family history of T2D burden among second-degree relatives was 2.728 times more frequent in the control group than in the T1D group (OR = 2.728; 95% Cl: 1.880-3.962, p < 0.001).

However, its application is largely limited by its toxicity in multiple organs. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) showed protective potential in various liver diseases, but the role of endogenous FGF1 in DOX-induced liver damage is currently unknown. Both wild-type (WT) and FGF1 knockout (FGF1-KO) mice were treated with DOX. DOX induced loss of body weight and liver weight and elevation of ALT and AST in WT mice, which were aggravated by FGF1 deletion. FGF1 deletion exacerbated hepatic oxidative stress mirrored by further elevated 3-nitrosative modification of multiple proteins and malondialdehyde content. These were accompanied by blunted compensatively antioxidative responses indicated by impaired upregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and its downstream antioxidant gene expression. The aggravated oxidative stress was coincided with exacerbated cell apoptosis in DOX-treated FGF1-KO mice reflected by further increased TUNEL positive cell staining and BCL-2-associated X expression and caspase 3 cleavage. These detrimental changes in DOX-treated FGF1-KO mice were associated with worsened intestinal fibrosis and increased upregulation fibrotic marker connective tissue growth factor and α-smooth muscle actin expression. However, DOX-induced hepatic inflammatory responses were not further affected by FGF1 deletion. These results demonstrate that endogenous FGF1 deficiency aggravates DOX-induced liver damage and FGF1 is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of DOX-associated hepatoxicity.",type 2 diabetics

Pre-sarcopenia, sarcopenia, and dynapenia were defined according to the definitions of the AWGS 2019 criteria. DHEAS level was positively associated with HS but not with SMI or GS after adjustment of confounding factors. Multiple logistic regression analyses in total subjects showed that DHEAS level had an inverse association with the prevalence of dynapenia but not with the prevalence of pre-sarcopenia or sarcopenia. Furthermore, a significant association between DHEAS level and dynapenia was found in males but not in females. ROC curve analysis indicated that cutoff values of serum DHEAS for risk of dynapenia in males was 92.0 μg/dL. Therefore, in male individuals with T2D who have low serum levels of DHEAS, adequate exercise might be needed to prevent dynapenia.",type 2 diabetics

The Ketogenic Effect of SGLT-2 Inhibitors-Beneficial or Harmful?,"['MichailKoutentakis', 'JakubKuciński', 'DamianŚwieczkowski', 'StanisławSurma', 'Krzysztof JFilipiak', 'AleksandraGąsecka']","Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, also called gliflozins or flozins, are a class of drugs that have been increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to their glucose-lowering, cardiovascular (CV), and renal positive effects. However, recent studies suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors might also have a ketogenic effect, increasing ketone body production. While this can be beneficial for some patients, it may also result in several potential unfavorable effects, such as decreased bone mineral density, infections, and ketoacidosis, among others. Due to the intricate and multifaceted impact caused by SGLT-2 inhibitors, this initially anti-diabetic class of medications has been effectively used to treat both patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those with heart failure (HF). Additionally, their therapeutic potential appears to extend beyond the currently investigated conditions. The objective of this review article is to present a thorough summary of the latest research on the mechanism of action of SGLT-2 inhibitors, their ketogenesis, and their potential synergy with the ketogenic diet for managing diabetes.

Partial and selective PPARγ modulators (GW0072, GQ16, VSP-51, MRL-20, MBX-213, INT131) have demonstrated superior results compared to full agonists without causing adverse effects, as reported in existing data. To address this uncertainty and advance therapeutic options, we identified and designed a novel class of compounds (A1-A23) based on a hybrid structure combining phenolic and Thiazolidine-4-one's moieties. Our rational drug design strategy incorporated structural-activity relationship principle, and validated the docking studies through calculated the root mean square deviation. Additionally, we conducted molecular docking, binding energy, molecular dynamics simulations, and post-molecular dynamics calculations to evaluate the dynamics behavior between the ligands and protein. The selected ligands demonstrated highly favorable docking scores and binding energies, comparable to the co-crystal (rosiglitazone) such as A12 (-13.9 kcal/mol and -86.2 kcal/mol), A1 (-11.1 kcal/mol and -79.5 kcal/mol), A13 (-11.3 kcal/mol and -91.4 kcal/mol), and the co-crystal itself (-9.8 kcal/mol and -76 kcal/mol), respectively.

Uptake of diabetes follow-up checks by minority community groups: a rapid review of the evidence for the CYMELL study.,"['Llinos HafSpencer', 'MohammedAlbustami', 'AlisonPorter', 'GargiNaha', 'Rebecca LThomas', 'SiânRees', 'RoseStewart', 'ThanujaHettiarachchi', ""NicolaO'Brien"", 'Rhiannon TudorEdwards', 'AshraKhanom']","Type 2 diabetes is a public health priority for the UK. A growing body of evidence has indicated ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in rates of diabetes prevalence and complications. Attendance at diabetes follow-up checks is key to ensuring complications are identified and managed at an early stage. The aim of this rapid review was to identify and summarise evidence of ways to improve diabetes management in ethnic minority groups.
In this rapid review, we searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and CINAHL for studies published in English between Jan 1, 2000, and Jan 31, 2023. Studies were included if the population was from ethnic minority groups and if the intervention was community-based and aimed to improve diabetes self-care. The comparisons were persuasion and behaviour change, and the outcomes were improved diabetes self-management including, glycaemic control, attending eye tests, kidney, and foot screening follow-up checks. This study is registered with PROSPERO 2023, CRD42023399283.
Nine studies were included, from Mexico (n=1), USA (n=7), and UK (n=1). Most studies reported on community engagement (n=8), and one focussed on peer support and diabetes self-management. Peer support and diabetes self-management education were found to significantly improve diabetes control in a Mayan community (n=29) in Mexico (p<0·0001) and in the Korean American (n=105), African American (n=107), and Latino American (n=56) communities in the USA. Another study showed that women from the Pakistani community in England also benefitted from a culturally appropriate and socially supportive environment when learning about diabetes self-management. Diabetic eye screening rates could be increased through education but not through incentive payments.
Culturally competent health-care policies and programmes have been shown to increase diabetes self-management including uptake of diabetes screening for people with diabetes from ethnic minority communities to avoid potential harmful and life limiting conditions. A strength of this review is that robust, recent, and relevant papers regarding self-management of diabetes were included. The main limitations were that none of the nine studies included any cost analyses, and only one UK-based study was included, indicating that further research is required to fill the evidence gap.

Autoimmune diseases and adverse pregnancy outcomes: an umbrella review.,"['MeghaSingh', 'StevenWambua', 'Siang IngLee', 'KelvinOkoth', 'ZhaonanWang', 'FathimaFazla', 'AhamedFayaz', 'Kelly-AnnEastwood', 'CatherineNelson-Piercy', 'KrishnarajahNirantharakumar', 'FrancescaCrowe', 'NoneNone']","The prevalence of autoimmune conditions is two-fold higher in women than in men, especially during the reproductive years. Autoimmune conditions have been associated with a greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and some conditions have been studied more than others with inconsistent findings. The objective of this umbrella review was to identify, appraise, synthesise, and consolidate findings from published systematic reviews of autoimmune conditions and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
In this umbrella review, we searched Medline, Embase, and Cochrane databases for systematic reviews from inception to Sept 30, 2022, without language restrictions. We used the Medical Subject Headings and free text search for autoimmune conditions and pregnancy outcomes. Screening, data extraction, and quality appraisal (AMSTAR 2) were done by two independent reviewers. Data was extracted using a standardised form, which was piloted before use. Data were synthesised narratively and quantitatively. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were reported. The protocol has been registered to PROSPERO (CRD42022334992).
We selected 33 reviews, which included 709 primary studies. Pregnant women with autoimmune conditions were at high risk of both adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The risk of miscarriage was increased in pregnant women with Sjögren's syndrome (relative risk [RR] 8·85, 95% CI 3·10-25·26), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; OR 4·90, 95% CI 3·10-7·69), thyroid autoimmunity (OR 2·77, 2·10-3·65), systemic sclerosis (OR 1·60, 1·29-2·22), and coeliac disease (OR 1·38, 1·12-1·69). The risk of pre-eclampsia was increased in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (T1DM; OR 4·19, 3·08-5·71) and SLE (OR 3·20, 2·54 - 4·20). The risk of gestational diabetes was increased in pregnant women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; OR 2·96, 1·47-5·98) and thyroid autoimmunity (OR 1·49, 1·07-2·07). The risk of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was increased in pregnant women with systemic sclerosis (OR 3·20, 2·21-4·53) and coeliac disease (OR 1·71, 1·36-2·14). The risk of delivering a small-for-gestational age baby was increased in pregnant women with SLE (OR 2·49, 1·88-3·31) and rheumatoid arthritis (OR 1·49, 1·22-1·82). The risks of other fetal outcomes such as stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birthweight were also increased in pregnant women with autoimmune disorders. T1DM in women was associated with lower odds of small-for-gestational-age outcome (OR 0·68, 0·56-0·83).
Pregnant women with autoimmune conditions are at greater risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes. Further research is required to develop better preconception to post-natal care for women with autoimmune conditions.

Evaluating the effectiveness of community health worker interventions on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"['JosephEvans', 'PatrickWhite', 'HowardHa']","Interventions with community health workers, trained to provide basic medical education and holistic support, have been used to enhance type 2 diabetes outcomes in various settings. Evidence of their effectiveness is poor because of variations in intervention design and duration. We did a systematic review of randomised trials evaluating the effectiveness of community health worker interventions integrated into conventional care to improve glycaemic control in adults with diabetes.

Use of the 2021 UK Medical Research Council guidance to refine the Women's Wellness with Type 2 Diabetes Programme: a mixed-methods study.,"['DenizBozkurt', 'MariaDuaso', 'JackieSturt']","The Women's Wellness with Type 2 Diabetes Programme (WWDP) is an online behavioural intervention for midlife women living with type 2 diabetes. The gender-specific intervention fosters self-efficacy, encouraging positive wellbeing behaviours to enhance diabetes and menopause outcomes. In 2016, We co-led a feasibility trial and process evaluation with 70 women aged 45-50 years from the UK and Australia. The intervention comprised an e-book, a website, and nurse consultations. The WWDP seemed to improved diabetes distress, self-efficacy, and menopausal symptoms, but with impactful, costly, diabetes nurse input, compromising feasibility and delivery by the NHS. We report WWDP refinement using the 2021 Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions to optimise future implementation.
Intervention refinement was guided by six core MRC elements of context, programme theory, stakeholder engagement, key uncertainties, intervention refinement, and economic considerations. Critical analysis of quantitative and qualitative feasibility data, informed by self-efficacy theory, provided a deeper understanding of how the intervention was used. Eight PPI consultations took place between Sept 1, 2021, and Dec 31, 2022, with three women from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds and three female diabetes professionals to strengthen the e-book and methods of support for women undertaking the programme.
Context was improved by the feasibility study and the PPI consultations, making the e-book relevant to UK health care. Understanding that self-efficacy was supported through primary use of peer group, and goal setting components supported the existing programme theory. Stakeholder engagement shaped the structure of the online peer support group. The feasibility study revealed uncertainties around goal settings. These uncertainties were addressed by introducing individualised goals focusing on aspects like medication adherence. The nurse support in the intervention was replaced with peer support, which might lead to greater economic feasibility of the programme. An optimised website and individualised goal setting underpin the WWDP.
The MRC Framework provides intervention refinement structure, allowing adaptive adjustments based on emerging evidence, feedback, and contextual nuances. Limitations exist. Intervention refinements, including peer support, might affect adherence and unexpected interactions. New components could influence long-term efficacy.

Early identification of primary dyslipidaemias via lipid clinic referral optimises patient management and enables cascade screening of relatives. Improving the identification of primary dyslipidaemias, and understanding disparities in ascertainment and management, is an NHS priority. We aimed to assess determinants of lipid clinic referral or attendance (LCR) in ethnically diverse adults.
We did a retrospective cross-sectional study using the Lambeth DataNet containing anonymised data from 41 general practitioner (GP) practices in south London. We looked at referral data for adult patients aged 18 years and older from Jan 1, 1995, until May 14, 2018. LCR was the main outcome. We used sequential multilevel logistic regression models adjusted for practice effects to estimate the odds of LCR assessed across six ethnic groups (reference group White) and patient-level factors (demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, comorbidities, total cholesterol [TC] >7·5mmol/L, statin prescription, and practice factors). The study was approved by NHS South East London Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) and NHS Lambeth CCG.
780 (0·23%) of 332 357 adult patients were coded as referred (n=538) or seen (n=252) in a lipid clinic. 164 487 (46·49%) were women (appendix). The fully adjusted model for odds of LCR showed the following significant associations for age (odds ratio [OR] 0·96, 95% CI 0·96-0·97, p<0·001); Black, African, Caribbean, or Black-British ethnicity (0·67, 0·53-0·84, p=0·001); ex-smoker status (1·29, 1·05-1·57, p=0·014); TC higher than 7·5 mmol/L (12·18, 9·60-15·45, p<0·001); statin prescription (14·01, 10·85-18·10, p<0·001); diabetes (0·72, 0·58-0·91, p=0·005); high-frequency GP attendance at seven or more GP consultations in the past year (1·49, 1·21-1·84, p<0·001); high GP-density (0·5-0·99 full-time equivalent GPs per 1000 patients; 2·70, 1·23-5·92, p=0·013). Sensitivity analyses for LCR restricted to familial hypercholesterolaemia-coded patients (n=581) found associations with TC higher than 7·5 mmol/L (4·26, 1·89-9·62, p<0·001), statin prescription (16·96, 2·19-131·36, p=0·007), and high GP-density (5·73, 1·27-25·93, p=0·023), with no significant associations with ethnicity. The relative contribution of GP practices to LCR was 6·32% of the total variance. There were no significant interactions between ethnicity and deprivation, age, or obesity.
While interpretation is limited by the accuracy and completeness of coded records, the study showed factors associated with a higher likelihood of LCR included individuals recorded as having TC higher than 7·5 mmol/L, statin prescription, ex-smoker status, high-frequency GP attendance, and registration at a GP practice with 0·5-0·99 GP density. Patients with increasing age; Black, African, Caribbean, or Black-British ethnicity patients; and patients with diabetes had lower odds of LCR. Finally, the difference in odds of LCR between Black and White patients highlights potential health inequalities.

Exploring the underlying mechanisms of fisetin in the treatment of hepatic insulin resistance via network pharmacology and in vitro validation.,"['TianLi', 'JunjunLing', 'XingrongDu', 'SiyuZhang', 'YanYang', 'LiangZhang']","To characterize potential mechanisms of fisetin on hepatic insulin resistance (IR) using network pharmacology and in vitro validation.
Putative targets of fisetin were retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology database, whereas the potential genes of hepatic IR were obtained from GeneCards database. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed according to the intersection targets of fisetin and hepatic IR using the Venn diagram. The biological functions and potential pathways related to genes were determined using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. Cell experiments were also conducted to further verify the mechanism of fisetin on hepatic IR.
A total of 118 potential targets from fisetin were associated with hepatic IR. The areas of nodes and corresponding degree values of TP53, AKT1, TNF, IL6, CASP3, CTNNB1, JUN, SRC, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and HSP90AA1 were larger and could be easily found in the PPI network. Furthermore, GO analysis revealed that these key targets were significantly involved in multiple biological processes that participated in oxidative stress and serine/threonine kinase activity. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was a significant pathway involved in hepatic IR. Our in vitro results demonstrated that fisetin treatment increased the expressions of EGFR and IRS in HepG2 and L02 cells under normal or IR conditions. Western blot results revealed that p-AKT/AKT levels were significantly up-regulated, suggesting that fisetin was involved in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to regulate insulin signaling.
We explored the pharmacological actions and the potential molecular mechanism of fisetin in treating hepatic IR from a holistic perspective. Our study lays a theoretical foundation for the development of fisetin for type 2 diabetes.",type 2 diabetics

The rs5186 (A116C) polymorphism of the Angiotensin II Receptor Type I gene (AGTR1), has been associated to multiple effects of renal injury risk, commonly detected in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). It has been described that rs5186 could have an effect in stability proteins that assemble Angiotensin II Receptor Type I (AT1), modifying its action, which is why it should be considered as a risk factor for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), characterized by a GFR progressive reduction. Even though, the association between rs5186 AGTR1 gene polymorphism and DKD in patients with T2DM has been controversial, inconclusive, and even absent. This disputable issue might be as a result of association studies in which many and varied clinical phenotypes included are contemplated as CKD inductors and enhancers. Although, the sample sizes studied in patients with T2DM are undersized and did not have a strict inclusion criteria, lacking of biochemical markers or KDOQI classification, which have hindered its examination.
The aim of our study was to establish an association between rs5186 AGTR1 gene polymorphism and GFR depletion, assessed as a risk factor to DKD development in patients with T2DM.
We analyzed 297 not related patients with T2DM, divided into 221 controls (KDOQI 1) and 76 cases (KDOQI 2).

Normality test for data distribution was analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk test, variable comparison by Student's t-test for continuous variables, and Chi-squared test for categorical variables; ANOVA test was used for mean comparison of more than two groups. Effect of rs5186 to DKD was estimated by multiple heritability adjustment models for risk variables of DKD. Statistical significance was indicated by p<0.05. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package STATA v11 software.

"How can we pharmacologically mimic the mechanisms that make gastric bypass so effective? Are we close to a ""medical bypass""?","['DimitriosTsilingiris', 'AlexanderKokkinos']","Currently, metabolic surgery (MS) constitutes the most effective means for durable weight loss of clinically meaningful magnitude, type 2 diabetes remission and resolution of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as other obesity-related comorbidities. Accumulating evidence on the mechanisms through which MS exerts its actions has highlighted the altered secretion of hormonally active peptides of intestinal origin with biological actions crucial to energy metabolism as key drivers of MS clinical effects. The initial success of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists regarding weight loss and metabolic amelioration have been followed by the development of unimolecular dual and triple polyagonists, additionally exploiting the effects of glucagon and/or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) which achieves a magnitude of weight loss approximating that of common MS operations. Through the implementation of such therapies, the feasibility of a ""medical bypass"", namely the replication of the clinical effects of MS through non-surgical interventions may be foreseeable in the near future. Apart from weight loss, this approach ought to be put to the test also regarding other clinical outcomes, such as liver steatosis and steatohepatitis, cardiovascular disease, and overall prognosis, on which MS has a robustly demonstrated impact.

Habit Formation Intervention to Improve Type 2 Diabetes Self-Management Behaviors: A Feasibility Study.,"['Diana RFeldhacker', 'Moses NIkiugu', 'HeatherFritz', 'William ESchweinle', 'HongmeiWang']","Self-management of lifestyle behaviors is the recommended focus for interventions to address Type 2 diabetes. Habit formation is an effective approach to changing personal behaviors, but evidence of success for Type 2 diabetes is limited.
To examine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of occupation-based habit formation interventions for improving diabetes self-management behaviors.
Single-subject design with multiple participants providing 4 wk of baseline data followed by 10 wk of intervention data.
Individual telehealth sessions.
Eight adults (ages 29-75 yr) with Type 2 diabetes, who had access to a telephone and who were not involved in other diabetes-related education or interventions voluntarily, enrolled into the study.
Participants engaged in 10 wk of habit formation intervention focused on four diabetes self-management domains: nutrition, blood glucose monitoring, medication management, and physical activity.
Data gathered included findings on measures of diabetes self-care behaviors and habit formation.
There was a significant change in self-care behaviors for 6 of the 8 participants (p < .05 for 1 participant, and p < .01 for 5 participants). Group changes were statistically significant (p < .001). Habit strength significantly improved for all areas of diabetes self-management (p < .001 for nutrition, blood glucose monitoring, and medication management and p = .001 for physical activity).
Findings suggest that the occupation-based intervention was feasible and showed promise for developing self-management behaviors. What This Article Adds: Habits are considered foundational to occupations, yet application of the science of habit formation is often not well understood by occupational therapists. This study considered the theoretical components of habit formation that have been neglected by prior studies and demonstrates the feasibility and preliminary effect estimates of a habit formation intervention when used with people with Type 2 diabetes.",type 2 diabetics
Nutrigenomics: SNPs Correlated to Lipid and Carbohydrate Metabolism.,"['GMadeo', 'KDonato', 'CMicheletti', 'SCristoni', 'SMiertus', 'JMiertus', 'DVeselenyiova', 'AIaconelli', 'BAquilanti', 'GMatera', 'S TConnelly', 'MBertelli']","Nutrigenomics - the study of the interactions between genetics and nutrition - has emerged as a pivotal field in personalized nutrition. Among various genetic variations, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been extensively studied for their probable relationship with metabolic traits.
Throughout this review, we have employed a targeted research approach, carefully handpicking the most representative and relevant articles on the subject. Our methodology involved a systematic review of the scientific literature to ensure a comprehensive and accurate overview of the available sources.
SNPs have demonstrated a significant influence on lipid metabolism, by impacting genes that encode for enzymes involved in lipid synthesis, transport, and storage. Furthermore, they have the ability to affect enzymes in glycolysis and insulin signaling pathways: in a way, they can influence the risk of type 2 diabetes. Thanks to recent advances in genotyping technologies, we now know numerous SNPs linked to lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. The large-scale studies on this topic have unveiled the potential of personalized dietary recommendations based on an individual's genetic makeup. Personalized nutritional interventions hold promise to mitigate the risk of various chronic diseases; however, translating these scientific insights into actionable dietary guidelines is still challenging.
As the field of nutrigenomics continues to evolve, collaborations between geneticists, nutritionists, and healthcare providers are essential to harness the power of genetic information for improving metabolic health. By unraveling the genetic basis of metabolic responses to diet, this field holds the potential to revolutionize how we approach dietary recommendations and preventive healthcare practices.",type 2 diabetics

Association of the dietary inflammation index (DII) with the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus.,"['ChunhuaGuo', 'YongLin', 'SenchaoWu', 'HuaqingLi', 'MengWu', 'FuzhenWang']","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). Inflammation is an essential component in the process of CKD progression in patients with DM. Diet is a significant determinant of systemic inflammation levels. However, the association between the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and CKD in individuals with DM remains largely unknown; therefore, the aim of this study was to explore whether the DII is linked to the prevalence of CKD in patients with DM. The research method was as follows: first, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2018 were obtained. There were 7,974 participants in our study. These individuals were then classified into three groups according to DII tertiles (T1-T3), with each group consisting of 2,658 participants. Logistic regression analysis was employed to examine whether there was a connection between the DII and CKD. We observed a significant association between the DII and the prevalence of CKD in individuals with DM. After full adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, drinking, body mass index (BMI), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), metabolic equivalents (METs), energy intake, hypoglycemic medications, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), the group with a higher DII had a greater frequency of CKD (T2 group: OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.10-1.76; ",type 2 diabetics
Impact of Diabetes Self-Management Education on A1C Levels Among Black/African Americans: A Systematic Review.,"['Hilda MOkeyo', 'MarthaBiddle', 'Lovoria BWilliams']","The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the impact of diabetes self-management education (DSME) programs on A1C levels of Black/African American adults with type 2 diabetes.
Authors followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed and CINAHL databases to identify articles published from 2000 to date. The primary outcome was A1C and participation in a DSME program among Black/African Americans with diabetes.
Nine high-quality randomized control trials (RCTs) were included in this review. Sample sizes ranged between 48 and 211. Studies reported Black/African American samples ranging from 23% to 57% (n = 4), 4 reported 100%, and 1 reported 96%. Most (56%) reported a statistically significant decline in A1C levels postprogram, whereas 44% noted insignificant changes. All the studies compared the DSME intervention effect to a control group or another type of diabetes self-management program.
The results suggest that DSME programs can be effective at lowering A1C levels in Black/African American adults; however, more research with larger sample sizes of Black/African Americans is warranted. The availability of meta-analyses and more RCTs could also further strengthen the external validity of this review. Additionally, future studies focused on A1C outcomes within DSME programs not combined with other self-management interventions among Black/African Americans can advance science regarding the impact of DSME programs among this disparate population.",type 2 diabetics
Associations between complexity of glucose time series and cognitive function in adults with type 2 diabetes.,"['CongcongYu', 'YaxinWang', 'BingZhang', 'XiangXu', 'WenZhang', 'QunDing', 'YingwenMiao', 'YinjiaoHou', 'XuelinMa', 'TianyuWu', 'SijueYang', 'LinqingFu', 'ZhouZhang', 'JianZhou', 'YanBi']","To characterize the comparative contributions of different glycaemic indicators to cognitive dysfunction, and further investigate the associations between the most significant indicator and cognitive function, along with related cerebral alterations.
We performed a cross-sectional study in 449 subjects with type 2 diabetes who completed continuous glucose monitoring and cognitive assessments. Of these, 139 underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate cerebral structure and olfactory neural circuit alterations. Relative weight and Sobol's sensitivity analyses were employed to characterize the comparative contributions of different glycaemic indicators to cognitive dysfunction.
Complexity of glucose time series index (CGI) was found to have a more pronounced association with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to glycated haemoglobin, time in range, and standard deviation. The proportion and multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for MCI increased with descending CGI tertile (Tertile 1: reference group [≥4.0]; Tertile 2 [3.6-4.0] OR 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-2.24; Tertile 3 [<3.6] OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.29-4.00). Decreased CGI was associated with cognitive decline in executive function and attention. Furthermore, individuals with decreased CGI displayed reduced olfactory activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and disrupted functional connectivity between the left OFC and right posterior cingulate gyrus. Mediation analysis demonstrated that the left OFC activation partially mediated the associations between CGI and executive function.
Decreased glucose complexity closely relates to cognitive dysfunction and olfactory brain activation abnormalities in diabetes.",type 2 diabetics

Lower risks of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma with GLP-1RAs in type 2 diabetes: A nationwide cohort study using target trial emulation framework.,"['Chun-TingYang', 'Wen-YuYao', 'Chen-YiYang', 'Zi-YangPeng', 'Huang-TzOu', 'ShihchenKuo']","To assess the association of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) versus long-acting insulins (LAIs), which are the two commonly prescribed injectable glucose-lowering agents (GLAs) for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) after the failure of multiple oral GLAs.
We emulated a target trial using the nationwide data of a Taiwanese cohort with T2D. Incident new users of GLP-1RAs and LAIs during 2013-2018 were identified, and propensity score (PS) matching was applied to ensure between-group comparability in baseline patient characteristics. The primary outcome was the composite liver disease including cirrhosis or HCC. Each patient was followed until the occurrence of a study outcome, death, or the end of 2019, whichever came first. Subdistribution hazard models were employed to assess the treatment-outcome association. Sensitivity (e.g., stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis, time-dependent analysis), E-value, and negative control outcome analyses were performed to examine the robustness of study findings.
We included 7171 PS-matched pairs of GLP-1RA and LAI users with no significant between-group differences at baseline. Compared with LAIs, the use of GLP-1RAs was associated with significantly reduced risks of composite liver disease (subdistribution hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.56 [0.42-0.76]), cirrhosis (0.59 [0.43-0.81]), and HCC (0.47 [0.24-0.93]). Results were consistent across sensitivity analyses and among patients with different baseline characteristics.

Reversible acute blindness in suspected metformin-associated lactic acidosis: a case report.,"['RuiHuang', 'WentaoSun']","Metformin is commonly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its multiple advantages include low risk of hypoglycemia, weight neutrality, low cost, and cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Renal insufficiency is one of the contraindications for its use. Inadvertent prescription in patients with renal insufficiency may lead to metformin-associated lactic acidosis, which brings a high risk of mortality. The early recognition and management of metformin-associated lactic acidosis are essential.
We present the case of a 58-year-old Hui woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with nephropathy and heart disease for which she was treated with metformin, insulin, and heart medications. She developed nausea, vomiting, anion gap metabolic acidosis due to hyperlactatemia, and acute kidney injury. She was hospitalized to receive intravenous hydration and correction of metabolic acidosis after she suddenly developed blindness. The diagnostic workup ruled out central causes and her symptoms resolved briefly after continuous venovenous hemodialysis was initiated, confirming the diagnosis of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.
Metabolic disruption can cause acute blindness. Metabolic acidosis in a patient with a history of metformin intake should suggest the possibility of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, which must be treated immediately, without waiting for the results of other examinations, especially in patients with sudden blindness. Further study of reversible blindness-associated severe metabolic acidosis is needed.",type 2 diabetics
Irisin suppresses pancreatic β cell pyroptosis in T2DM by inhibiting the NLRP3-GSDMD pathway and activating the Nrf2-TrX/TXNIP signaling axis.,"['TianrongLi', 'JingjingYang', 'AnjunTan', 'HewenChen']","Irisin plays a key role in metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the mechanism underlying the link between irisin and the development of T2DM, particularly in pancreatic islet β-cells, remains unknown.
In vitro, Min6 cells were treated with high glucose (HG) to generate T2DM cell models. GSDMD-N staining, Western blotting assays, and ELISA were performed to measure the expression levels of GSDMD, caspase 1, IL-1β, and IL-18. Next, the NLRP3 stimulator, ATP, was used to assess the effect of irisin on NLRP3 inflammasome. To evaluate the function of the Nrf2-TrX/TXNIP signaling axis, the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 was used. For in vivo assessment, we first established T2DM model mice. Then, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to observe the islet morphology, and the immunofluorescence technique was used to examine the mass of α and β cells. To confirm the role of the Nrf2-TrX/TXNIP signaling axis, ML385 was injected into the mice. Immunofluorescence of Nrf2, caspase 1, and GSDMD was detected in the islet cells of the model mice to verify the results.
We found that irisin treatment significantly decreased the expression of GSDMD-N (P31) and cleaved caspase-1 (p20), decreased caspase1 activity, and inhibited the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18 in HG-treated Min6 cells. We also found that irisin inhibited oxidative stress and NLRP3 expression by activating the Nrf2-TrX/TXNIP signaling axis. Additionally, in the T2DM model mice, irisin enhanced the function of islet cells, decreased insulin resistance, and preserved the morphology of pancreatic islets.
We showed in this study that irisin can be used for treating pyroptosis in HG-induced islet β-cells and T2DM model mice. We also found that irisin inhibits pyroptosis and oxidative stress by inhibiting the NLRP3-GSDMD pathway and activating the Nrf2-TrX/TXNIP signaling axis.",type 2 diabetics

The Korean Genome And Epidemiology Study is an ongoing prospective longitudinal cohort study of community dwellers and participants (men and women, aged 40-69 years) recruited from the national health examinee registry of Korea. Their individual consumption habits for 12 different fruit types were recorded using food frequency questionnaires. The fruits were then divided into three groups according to their glycemic indexes and glycemic loads. Participants with extreme caloric intakes, pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney diseases, chronic liver diseases, and ongoing cancer treatments were excluded. The incidence of type 2 diabetes in the cohort was identified through self-reporting and supplemented by glycated hemoglobin and fasting blood glucose levels.

All subjects underwent enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT), and CT values were noted. To measure CVI, luminal (LA) and stromal areas of the choroidal images were binarized using Image J program. CVI was defined as the proportion of LA to total choroid area (TCA). Demographic and laboratory data of the patients were collected retrospectively.
CVI were found to be lower in diabetic patients compared to non-diabetic patients. CVI values in 3 groups were as follows: 67.9% ± 1.8 (healthy controls), 66.1% ± 2.4 (no DR), and 63.2% ± 2.6 (NPDRP) (p < 0.001). All groups were similar in terms of CT values (p = 0.296). The cut-off value for CVI in predicting retinopathy was 64.7%. Hypertension and current smoking were found to be more frequent in diabetic patients with CVI < 64.7% compared to those with CVI > 64.7%.
CVI tends to be lower in diabetic patients with or without DR compared to healthy controls. Moreover, patients with DR have a lower CVI than those without DR. CVI can be considered an early and sensitive biomarker for the onset of DR.",type 2 diabetics
Value of radiomics-based two-dimensional ultrasound for diagnosing early diabetic nephropathy.,"['XueeSu', 'ShuLin', 'YinqiongHuang']","Despite efforts to diagnose diabetic nephropathy (DN) using biochemical data or ultrasound imaging separately, a significant gap exists regarding the development of integrated models combining both modalities for enhanced early DN diagnosis. Therefore, we aimed to assess the ability of machine learning models containing two-dimensional ultrasound imaging and biochemical data to diagnose early DN in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This retrospective study included 219 patients, divided into a training or test group at an 8:2 ratio. Features were selected using minimum redundancy maximum relevance and random forest-recursive feature elimination. The predictive performance of the models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for sensitivity, specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, F1 score, and accuracy. K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and logistic regression models could diagnose early DN, with AUC values of 0.94, 0.85, and 0.85 in the training cohort and 0.91, 0.84, and 0.84 in the test cohort, respectively. Early DN diagnosing using two-dimensional ultrasound-based radiomics models can potentially revolutionize T2DM patient care by enabling proactive interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Our integrated approach showcases the power of artificial intelligence in medical imaging, enhancing early disease detection strategies with far-reaching applications across medical disciplines.",type 2 diabetics
A comprehensive analysis of genetic risk for metabolic syndrome in the Egyptian population via allele frequency investigation and Missense3D predictions.,"['MahmoudBassyouni', 'MohamedMysara', 'InkenWohlers', 'HaukeBusch', 'MahaSaber-Ayad', 'MohamedEl-Hadidi']","Diabetes mellitus (DM) represents a major health problem in Egypt and worldwide, with increasing numbers of patients with prediabetes every year. Numerous factors, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, which have recently become serious concerns, affect the complex pathophysiology of diabetes. These metabolic syndrome diseases are highly linked to genetic variability that drives certain populations, such as Egypt, to be more susceptible to developing DM. Here we conduct a comprehensive analysis to pinpoint the similarities and uniqueness among the Egyptian genome reference and the 1000-genome subpopulations (Europeans, Ad-Mixed Americans, South Asians, East Asians, and Africans), aiming at defining the potential genetic risk of metabolic syndromes. Selected approaches incorporated the analysis of the allele frequency of the different populations' variations, supported by genotypes' principal component analysis. Results show that the Egyptian's reference metabolic genes were clustered together with the Europeans', Ad-Mixed Americans', and South-Asians'. Additionally, 8563 variants were uniquely identified in the Egyptian cohort, from those, two were predicted to cause structural damage, namely, CDKAL1: 6_21065070 (A > T) and PPARG: 3_12351660 (C > T) utilizing the Missense3D database. The former is a protein coding gene associated with Type 2 DM while the latter is a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation and glucose homeostasis. Both variants were detected heterozygous in two different Egyptian individuals from overall 110 sample. This analysis sheds light on the unique genetic traits of the Egyptian population that play a role in the DM high prevalence in Egypt. The proposed analysis pipeline -available through GitHub- could be used to conduct similar analysis for other diseases across populations.",type 2 diabetics
Characteristics of metabolic inflammatory syndrome among inpatients with type 2 diabetes: A cross-sectional study in China.,"['RumeiLi', 'BinLu', 'QiangLi', 'JiHu', 'YunHuang', 'YangangWang', 'GuijunQin', 'WeiweiZhang', 'QingSu', 'JunZhu', 'YanchengXu', 'HongweiJiang', 'XinjunWang', 'KeqingZhang', 'YuzhiYang', 'RenmingHu']","As meta-inflammation is a common feature for obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis, we have proposed a new concept, metabolic inflammatory syndrome (MIS), to cluster such diseases. We aimed to characterize MIS and explore its association with coronary heart disease (CHD) among T2D inpatients in China.
A total number of 8344 T2D participants were enrolled. Each component of MIS and metabolic syndrome (MS) was analyzed. Their association with the risk of CHD was assessed using a binary logistic analysis.
Among the T2D inpatients, the detection rate of MIS was much higher than that of MS (93.6 % vs. 53.2 %). Among all the components of MIS and MS, carotid atherosclerosis (71.9 %) was most commonly detected, which increased with aging in subgroups. Surprisingly, the most common combination of MIS was with all 4 components in T2D patients, with a constituent ratio of 30.9 %. According to the odds ratios (ORs), MIS was a better predictor of CHD than MS, especially after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, and alcohol consumption (adjusted OR for MIS: 3.083; for MS: 1.515). The presence of more components of MIS was associated with a higher detection rate of CHD (P < 0.001). Among all the components of MIS and MS, carotid atherosclerosis best predicted the risk of CHD (adjusted OR: 1.787).
MIS is an independent risk factor for CHD, with a bigger OR value than MS. Carotid atherosclerosis, with the highest detection rate, was the best individual predictor of CHD and thus a critical component of MIS. The concept of MIS represents the understanding of metabolic diseases from the perspective of holistic integrative medicine.",type 2 diabetics

We determined whether longitudinal N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurements during hypertension treatment are associated with kidney function decline.
Prospective observational study.
& Participants: 8005 Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) participants with NT-proBNP measurements at baseline and 1 year.
1-year change in NT-proBNP categorized as ≥25% decrease, ≥25% increase, and <25% change (stable).
Annualized change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and ≥30% decline in eGFR.
Linear mixed-effect and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of change in NT-proBNP with subsequent annualized change in eGFR and ≥30% decline in eGFR, respectively. Analyses stratified by baseline chronic kidney disease (CKD) status.
Compared with stable 1-year NT-proBNP levels, a ≥25% decrease in NT-proBNP was associated with slower decline in eGFR in those with CKD (adjusted difference [% per year] =1.09 [95% CI, 0.35-1.83]) and without CKD (adjusted difference [% per year] =0.51 [95% CI, 0.21-0.81]; P for interaction =0.4). Meanwhile, ≥25% increase in NT-proBNP in those with CKD was associated with faster decline in eGFR (adjusted difference [% per year] = -1.04 [95% CI, -1.72 to -0.36]) and risk of ≥30% decline in eGFR (adjusted odds ratio: 1.44 [95% CI, 1.06-1.96]); associations were stronger in those with CKD versus without CKD (P for interactions =0.01 and <0.001, respectively). Relationships were similar irrespective of the randomized BP arm in SPRINT (P for interactions >0.2).
Persons with diabetes and proteinuria > 1 g/d were excluded.
Changes in NT-proBNP during BP treatment are independently associated with subsequent kidney function decline, particularly in people with CKD. Studies should assess if dynamic NT-proBNP may be useful in monitoring kidney risk during hypertension treatment.",type 2 diabetics

We performed a retrospective multicenter cross-sectional study involving 1,409 adult outpatients with T1DM, in whom hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and fibrosis (FIB)-4 index were calculated for non-invasively detecting hepatic steatosis (defined by HSI > 36), with or without coexisting significant fibrosis (FIB-4 index ≥ 1.3 or < 1.3). CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m
Patients with MASLD and significant fibrosis (n = 93) had a remarkably higher prevalence of CKD and diabetic retinopathy than their counterparts with MASLD without fibrosis (n = 578) and those without steatosis (n = 738). After adjustment for sex, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, hypertension, and use of antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medications, patients with SLD and significant fibrosis had a higher risk of prevalent CKD (adjusted-odds ratio 1.76, 95 % confidence interval 1.05-2.96) than those without steatosis. Patients with MASLD without fibrosis had a higher risk of prevalent retinopathy (adjusted-odds ratio 1.49, 95 % CI 1.13-1.46) than those without steatosis.

Role of pre-surgical gut microbial diversity in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass weight-loss response: A cohort study.,"['SofíaMorán-Ramos', 'RuthSoriano-Cortés', 'ValeriaSoto-Fuentes', 'AmyrisTenorio-Quiroz', 'EmmanuelGervasio-Ortiz', 'DulceRico-Amador', 'MiguelHerrera', 'MauricioSierra-Salazar', 'Carlos AAguilar-Salinas', 'BarbaraAntuna-Puente', 'MarcelaRodríguez-Flores']","Roux-en-Y gastric bypass substantially alters the gut microbial composition which could be associated with the metabolic improvements seen after surgery. Few studies have been conducted in Latin American populations, such as Mexico where obesity prevalence is above 30% in the adult population. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the changes in gut microbiota structure in a Mexican cohort before and after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and to explore whether surgery-related changes in the microbial community were associated with weight loss.
Biological samples from patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were examined before and 12 months after surgery. Fecal microbiota characterization was performed through 16S rRNA sequencing.
Twenty patients who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass showed a median excess weight loss of 66.8% 12 months after surgery. Surgery increased alpha diversity estimates (Chao, Shannon index and observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs), p<0.05), and significantly altered gut microbiota composition. Abundance of four genera were significantly increased after surgery: Oscillospira, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and an unclassified genus from Enterobacteriaceae family (PFDR<0.1). The change in Veillonella abundance was associated with lower excess weight loss (rho=-0.446, p=0.063) and its abundance post-surgery with a greater BMI (rho=0.732, P=5.4x10-4). In subjects without type 2 diabetes lower bacterial richness and diversity before surgery were associated with a greater Veillonella increase after surgery (p<0.05), suggesting that a lower bacterial richness before surgery could favor the bloom of certain oral-derived bacteria that could negatively impact weight loss.
Pre-surgical microbiota profile may favor certain bacterial changes associated with less successful results.",type 2 diabetics

Long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have become central to treating type 2 diabetes (T2D); however, these therapies are burdensome, as they must be taken daily or weekly. Technological innovations that enable less frequent administrations would reduce patient burden and increase patient compliance. Herein, we leverage an injectable hydrogel depot technology to develop a GLP-1 RA drug product capable of months-long GLP-1 RA delivery. Using a rat model of T2D, we confirm that one injection of hydrogel-based therapy sustains exposure of GLP-1 RA over 42 days, corresponding to a once-every-4-months therapy in humans. Hydrogel therapy maintains management of blood glucose and weight comparable to daily injections of a leading GLP-1 RA drug. This long-acting GLP-1 RA treatment is a promising therapy for more effective T2D management.",type 2 diabetics
The protective effects of icariin against testicular dysfunction in type 1 diabetic mice Via AMPK-mediated Nrf2 activation and NF-κB p65 inhibition.,"['Chao-ShengLu', 'Chen-YuWu', 'Yi-HongWang', 'Qing-QingHu', 'Rong-YueSun', 'Min-JiePan', 'Xin-YuLu', 'TingZhu', 'ShuangLuo', 'Hong-JingYang', 'DanWang', 'Hong-WeiWang']","Owing to the early suffering age and the rising incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D), the resulting male reproductive dysfunction and fertility decline have become a disturbing reality worldwide, with no effective strategy being available. Icariin (ICA), a flavonoid extracted from Herba Epimedium, has been proved its promising application in improving diabetes-related complications including diabetic nephropathy, endothelial dysfunction and erectile dysfunction. Ensuring the future reproductive health of children and adolescents with T1D is crucial to improve global fertility. However, its roles in the treatment of T1D-induced testicular dysfunction and the potential mechanisms remain elusive.
The purpose of this present study was to investigate whether ICA ameliorates T1D-induced testicular dysfunction as well as its potential mechanisms.
T1D murine model was established by intraperitoneal injection of STZ with or without treated with ICA for eleven weeks. Morphological, pathological and serological experiments were used to determine the efficacy of ICA on male reproductive function of T1D mice. Western blotting, Immunohistochemistry analysis, qRT-PCR and kit determination were performed to investigated the underlying mechanisms.
We found that replenishment of ICA alleviated testicular damage, promoted testosterone production and spermatogenesis, ameliorated apoptosis and blood testis barrier impairment in streptozotocin-induced T1D mice. Functionally, ICA treatment triggered adenosine monophosphate protein kinase (AMPK) activation, which in turn inhibited the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-κB p65) to reduce inflammatory responses in the testis and activated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(Nrf2), thereby enhancing testicular antioxidant capacity. Further studies revealed that supplementation with the AMPK antagonist Compound C or depletion of Nrf2 weakened the beneficial effects of ICA on testicular dysfunction of T1D mice.
Collectively, these results demonstrate the feasibility of ICA in the treatment of T1D-induced testicular dysfunction, and reveal the important role of AMPK-mediated Nrf2 activation and NF-κB p65 inhibition in ICA-associated testicular protection during T1D.",type 2 diabetics

To identify a model of insulin sensitivity using widely available clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with T2D and evaluate its association with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
140 patients with T2D underwent a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp to measure total body glucose disposal rate (mg kg-1 min-1). We used demographic, clinical and common laboratory parameters to estimate insulin sensitivity (IS) via stepwise linear regression on 85 patients (training cohort) and validated it in the remaining 55 (validation cohort). The identified equation was then applied to 3553 patients with T2D from the 1999-2010 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to evaluate its association with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality up to December 2015.
The best model included triglycerides, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, albumin excretion rate and body mass index. The identified IS score correlated well with the clamp-derived glucose disposal rate in both the training (r = 0.77, p < 0.001) and the validation (r = 0.74, p < 0.001) cohorts. In the NHANES cohort, after a median follow-up of 8.3 years, 1054 patients died, 265 of cardiovascular causes. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, race-ethnicity, education, cigarette smoke, total cholesterol, chronic kidney disease, blood pressure, prevalent cardiovascular disease and alcohol consumption, a higher estimated IS was associated with a lower risk of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
We propose a new model of IS in patients with T2D based on readily available clinical and laboratory data. Its potential applications are in in both diagnosis as well as prognostication.",type 2 diabetics

In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the presence of sub-clinical coronary artery pathology in people with type 2 diabetes, free of overt CVD. Using multimodal imaging, we assessed the coronary microcalcification activity (18F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), plaque inflammation (64Cu- DOTATATE PET/CT) and myocardial flow reserve (82Rubidium PET/CT). The study population consisted of 90 participants, stratified by albuminuria; 60 had historic or current albuminuria (urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g)), and 30 had normoalbuminuria (UACR < 30 mg/g). We demonstrated that any albuminuria (historic or current) was associated with a more severe phenotype, in particularly higher levels of microcalcifications and impaired myocardial microvascular function, however, coronary inflammation activity was similar in people with and without albuminuria. Our findings establish a potential underlying mechanism connecting cardiovascular and kidney diseases and could indicate the initial stages of the cardiorenal syndrome.",type 2 diabetics

This study aims to explore the experiences of female community health volunteers (FCHVs) in a community-based pilot project in western Nepal, specially regarding the social challenges they face while delivering basic type 2 diabetes (T2D) services. Using a qualitative phenomenological approach, the study conducted two focus group discussions and nine in-depth interviews with a total of 14 and 9 FCHVs, respectively. Social Capital theory was employed to understand the sociological aspects. The findings shed light on the challenges encountered by FCHVs in expanding their social networks, building trust, and fostering reciprocity among T2D intervention recepients. Notably, social trust was a significant challenge, compounded by power dynamics related to gender and socioeconomic status. FCHVs managed to overcome these challenges through their perseverance, self-motivation, and leaveraging their strong bonding and linking social capital. The recognition they received from the community played a crucial role in sustaining their motivation. The study highlights the importance of FCHVs' strong social capital, supported by available resources and personal motivation, in overcoming social obstacles. It is imperative for community health interventions to anticipate challenges across various elements of social capital to ensure the long-term retention and motivation of CHWs.

The occurrence of NAFLD was defined based claims that include diagnostic codes. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models in 1:3 propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts. For 65,224 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, the overall prevalence of NAFLD was 42.6%. The PS-matched Cohort 1 included 6,351 and 2,117 new users of DPP-4i and TZD, respectively.

Cardiovascular and Renal Benefit of Novel Non-steroidal Mineralocorticoid Antagonists in Patients with Diabetes.,['UlrichKintscher'],"Novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists (MRAs) are a new class of drugs blocking adverse MR-mediated effects with an improved benefit-risk profile compared to steroidal MRAs. This review will provide information on the preclinical and clinical pharmacology of this new drug class and will discuss their future clinical applications in patients with cardiorenal disease.
Non-steroidal MRAs such as esaxerenone, AZD9977, apararenone, ocedurenone (KBP-5074), and finerenone are newly approved or in clinical development for patients with cardiorenal disease including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension -/+ CKD or heart failure. Unlike steroidal MRAs, non-steroidal MRAs do not induce sex hormone-related side effects and appear to mediate a lower risk of hyperkalemia while maintaining compelling clinical efficacy. Recently, new data from several clinical trials with non-steroidal MRAs have been published (e.g., FIDELIO-DKD, FIGARO-DKD, ESAX-DN, and BLOCK-CKD), and additional studies are currently underway (e.g., FINEARTS-HF and CLARION-CKD). These data and the clinical scientific basis for the ongoing studies will be discussed. Non-steroidal MRAs have been extensively explored in diabetic kidney disease. Selected candidates of this drug class reduced UACR in patients with varying degrees of CKD and T2D and have shown convincing cardiorenal protection, in particular finerenone.

We recruited 13 patients with comorbid MDD and T2DM and 27 patients with only MDD. We measured interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels as inflammatory cytokines and metabolites of the kynurenine pathway and examined the relationship between the two. TNF-α levels were significantly higher in patients with comorbid MDD and T2DM than in those with only MDD in univariate (p = 0.044) and multivariate (adjusted p = 0.036) analyses. TNF-α showed a statistically significant effect modification (interaction) with quinolinic acid/tryptophan and serotonin in patients from both groups (β = 1.029, adjusted p < 0.001; β =  - 1.444, adjusted p = 0.047, respectively). Limitations attributed to the study design and number of samples may be present. All patients were Japanese with mild to moderate MDD; therefore, the generalizability of our findings may be limited. MDD with T2DM has more inflammatory depression components and activations of the kynurenine pathway by inflammatory cytokines than MDD without T2DM. Hence, administering antidepressants and anti-inflammatory drugs in combination may be more effective in patients with comorbid MDD and T2DM.",type 2 diabetics
The effect of acute and 14-day exogenous ketone supplementation on glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes: two randomized controlled trials.,"['KajaFalkenhain', 'Barbara FOliveira', 'HashimIslam', 'HelenaNeudorf', 'Haoning HCen', 'James DJohnson', 'KennethMadden', 'JoelSinger', 'Jeremy JWalsh', 'Jonathan PLittle']","Acute ingestion of the exogenous ketone monoester supplement [(R)-3-hydroxybutyl-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] lowers blood glucose, suggesting therapeutic potential in individuals with impaired glucose metabolism. However, it is unknown how acute or repeated ingestion of exogenous ketones affect blood glucose control in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We conducted two randomized, counter-balanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials to determine if (1) acute exogenous ketone monoester (0.3 g/kg body mass; N=18), or (2) 14-day thrice daily pre-meal exogenous ketone monoester (15 g; N=15) supplementation could lower blood glucose in individuals living with T2D. A single dose of the ketone monoester supplement elevated blood ß-OHB to ~2 mM. There were no differences in the primary outcomes of plasma glucose concentration (acutely) or serum fructosamine (glycaemic control across 14 days) between conditions. Ketone monoester ingestion acutely increased insulin and lowered non-esterified fatty acid concentrations; plasma metabolomics confirmed a reduction in multiple free fatty acids species and select gluconeogenic amino acids. In contrast, no changes were observed in fasting metabolic outcomes following 14 days of supplementation. In the context of these randomized controlled trials, acute or repeated ketone monoester ingestion in adults with T2D did not lower blood glucose when consumed acutely in a fasted state, and did not improve glycaemic control following thrice daily pre-meal ingestion across 14 days. Future studies exploring the mechanistic basis for the (lack of) glucose-lowering effect of exogenous ketone supplementation in T2D and other populations are warranted.",type 2 diabetics

In this work, the individual metabolic brain networks were constructed with Jensen-Shannon divergence for 4 groups (elderly type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls, and middle-aged type 2 diabetes mellitus and healthy controls). Regional network properties were used to identify hub regions. Rich-club, feeder, and local connections were subsequently obtained, intergroup differences in connections and correlations between them and age (or fasting plasma glucose) were analyzed. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to explore effects of network changes on the probability of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The elderly had increased rich-club and feeder connections, and decreased local connection than the middle-aged among type 2 diabetes mellitus; type 2 diabetes mellitus had decreased rich-club and feeder connections than healthy controls. Protective factors including glucose metabolism in triangle part of inferior frontal gyrus, metabolic connectivity between triangle of the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex, degree centrality of putamen, and risk factors including metabolic connectivities between triangle of the inferior frontal gyrus and Heschl's gyri were identified for the probability of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Regulatory roles of CARD9-BCL10-Rac1 (CBR) signalome in islet β-cell function in health and metabolic stress: Is there room for MALT1?,['AnjaneyuluKowluru'],"It is widely accepted that pancreatic islet β-cell failure and the onset of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) constitute an intricate interplay between the genetic expression of the disease and a host of intracellular events including increased metabolic (oxidative, endoplasmic reticulum) stress under the duress of glucolipotoxicity. Emerging evidence implicates unique roles for Caspase Recruitment Domain containing protein 9 (CARD9) in the onset of metabolic diseases, including obesity and insulin resistance. Mechanistically, CARD9 has been implicated in the regulation of p38MAPK and NFkB signaling pathways culminating in cellular dysfunction. Several regulatory factors, including B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (BCL10) have been identified as modulators of CARD9 function in multiple cell types. Despite this evidence on regulatory roles of CARD9-BCL10 signalome in the onset of various pathological states, putative roles of this signaling module in islet β-cell dysfunction in metabolic stress remain less understood. This brief review is aimed at highlighting roles for CARD9 in islet β-cell function under acute (physiological insulin secretion) and long-term (cell dysfunction) exposure to glucose. Emerging roles of other signaling proteins, such as Rac1, BCL10 and MALT1 as contributors to CARD9 signaling in the islet β-cells are also reviewed. Potential avenues for future research toward the development of novel therapeutics for the prevention CARD9-BCL10-Rac1 (CBR) signalome-induced β-cell defects under metabolic stress are discussed.",type 2 diabetics

Preclinical studies show attenuating effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists on addiction-related behaviors in rodents and nonhuman primates. Some trials have shown an effect of GLP-1 agonism on reward processes in humans; however, results from clinical studies remain inconclusive.METHODSThis is a predefined secondary analysis of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the GLP-1 agonist dulaglutide as a therapy for smoking cessation. The main objective was to assess differences in alcohol consumption after 12 weeks of treatment with dulaglutide compared to placebo. The effect of dulaglutide on alcohol consumption was analyzed using a multivariable generalized linear model.RESULTSIn the primary analysis, participants out of the cohort (n = 255) who reported drinking alcohol at baseline and who completed 12 weeks of treatment (n = 151; placebo n = 75, dulaglutide n = 76) were included. The median age was 42 (IQR 33-53) with 61% (n = 92) females. At week 12, participants receiving dulaglutide drank 29% less (relative effect = 0.71, 95% CI 0.52-0.97, P = 0.04) than participants receiving placebo. Changes in alcohol consumption were not correlated with smoking status at week 12.CONCLUSIONThese results provide evidence that dulaglutide reduces alcohol intake in humans and contribute to the growing body of literature promoting the use of GLP-1 agonists in treatment of substance use disorders.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov NCT03204396.FUNDINGSwiss National Foundation, Gottfried Julia Bangerter-Rhyner Foundation, Goldschmidt-Jacobson Foundation, Hemmi Foundation, University of Basel, University Hospital Basel, Swiss Academy of Medical Science.",type 2 diabetics
"Based on Bioinformatics to Explore the Mechanism of ""Tangzhiqing"" Decoction Alleviating Type 2 Diabetes-associated Cognitive Dysfunction in Mice by Regulating Hippocampal Neuron Apoptosis and Autophagy.","['YinliShi', 'PeiSheng', 'YunZhao', 'XuWang', 'XiruXu', 'SifanSun']","Diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD) is emerging as a chronic complication of diabetes that is gaining increasing international recognition. The traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulation, Tangzhiqing decoction (TZQ), has shown the capacity to modulate the memory function of mice with DCD by ameliorating insulin resistance. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism underlying the effects of TZQ remains elusive.
The chemical constituents of TZQ were screened using TCMSP databases, and DCDassociated disease targets were retrieved from various databases. Subsequently, core targets were identified through network topology analysis. The core targets underwent analysis using Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotations and enrichment in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Models were established through high-fat and high-glucose diet feeding along with intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). TZQ and metformin were administered at varying doses over 8 weeks. The Morris water maze was employed to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of each rat group, while indicators of oxidative stress and insulin were assessed in mice. Neuronal apoptosis in distinct groups of mice's hippocampi was detected using TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL), and western blot (WB) analysis was conducted to assess the expression of apoptosis- and autophagy-related proteins, including Bax, Bcl2, Caspase3, Caspase8, Beclin1, ATG7, LC3, p62, and Lamp2, within the hippocampus.
TZQ exhibited the capacity to modulate neuronal autophagy, ameliorate endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, as well as to regulate synaptic plasticity and conduction. TZQ mitigated cognitive dysfunction in mice, while also regulating hippocampal inflammation and apoptosis. Additionally, it influenced the protein expression of autophagy-related factors such as Bax, Bcl2, Caspase3, Caspase8, Beclin1, ATG7, and LC3. Notably, this modulation significantly reduced neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus and curbed excessive autophagy.
TZQ demonstrated a substantial reduction in neuronal apoptosis within the hippocampus and effectively suppressed excessive autophagy.",type 2 diabetics

However, a few studies have examined the effects of exercise therapy on patients with T2DM undergoing inpatient diabetes self-management education and support (IDSMES).
This study investigated whether exercise therapy influenced the incidence of admission after discharge in patients with T2DM undergoing IDSMES.
This retrospective cohort study included patients with T2DM who underwent IDSMES between June 2011 and May 2015. Overall, 258 patients were included in this study. The exercise therapy program was implemented in June 2013. Accordingly, patients diagnosed between June 2011 and May 2013 were categorized as the non-exercise therapy program group, while those diagnosed between June 2013 and May 2015 were categorized as the exercise therapy program group. Outcomes were incident diabetes-related and all-cause admissions within 1 year of discharge. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the exercise therapy program's impact on the outcomes.
Within 1 year of discharge, 27 (10.5%) patients underwent diabetes-related admissions and 62 (24.0%) underwent all-cause admissions.

"Obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiometabolic risk: An Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) 2023.","['Harold EdwardBays', 'ShagunBindlish', 'Tiffany LoweClayton']","This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is intended to provide clinicians an overview of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), an obesity-related cardiometabolic risk factor.
The scientific support for this CPS is based upon published citations and clinical perspectives of OMA authors.
Topics include T2DM and obesity as cardiometabolic risk factors, definitions of obesity and adiposopathy, and mechanisms for how obesity causes insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Adipose tissue is an active immune and endocrine organ, whose adiposopathic obesity-mediated dysfunction contributes to metabolic abnormalities often encountered in clinical practice, including hyperglycemia (e.g., pre-diabetes mellitus and T2DM). The determination as to whether adiposopathy ultimately leads to clinical metabolic disease depends on crosstalk interactions and biometabolic responses of non-adipose tissue organs such as liver, muscle, pancreas, kidney, and brain.
This review is intended to assist clinicians in the care of patients with the disease of obesity and T2DM. This CPS provides a simplified overview of how obesity may cause insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and T2DM. It also provides an algorithmic approach towards treatment of a patient with obesity and T2DM, with ""treat obesity first"" as a priority. Finally, treatment of obesity and T2DM might best focus upon therapies that not only improve the weight of patients, but also improve the health outcomes of patients (e.g., cardiovascular disease and cancer).",type 2 diabetics
The complexity of obesity-related health problems after bariatric surgery: The patient perspective.,"['GKonings', 'MDrukker', 'RSevereijns', 'RPonds']","Bariatric surgery aims to improve quality of life by means of weight loss. Obesity-related physical and psychological health problems should improve, but long-term data are scarce.
To evaluate preoperative physical and mental health problems perceived by the patient and the association with weight loss and quality of life, 5 years after bariatric surgery.
101 persons (response rate 67%) who had had bariatric surgery an average of 4.6 years before this study completed a written survey on obesity-related physical and psychological health problems and three psychological questionnaires collecting information on eating behavior and quality of life. Over half of the participants (55%) had had a laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.
Preoperatively reported health problems improved but were not necessarily associated with weight loss. Minimal improvement in tiredness, shame and weight instability were associated with significantly less weight loss. Preoperative type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) improved but participants had significantly less weight loss and more dissatisfaction regarding the bariatric trajectory than participants without T2D. Eating concerns, emotional eating and external eating improved but not restrained eating. Compared to the Dutch population reference, most quality of life scores of the participants were lower.
In this analysis, participants did report satisfaction although from a patients' perspective, improvements of weight and health did not necessarily lead to satisfaction regarding the bariatric trajectory. Participants with postoperative reported fatigue and shame as well as participants with preoperative T2D showed significant less weight loss.

Why does type 2 diabetes mellitus impair weight reduction in patients with obesity? A review.,['Harold EdwardBays'],"A common adiposopathic complication of obesity is type 2 diabetes mellitus. Healthful weight reduction in patients with obesity can improve glucose metabolism and potentially promote remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, weight-reduction in patients with increased adiposity is impaired among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to patients without diabetes mellitus.
Data for this review were derived from PubMed and applicable websites.
Among patients with increased body fat, the mechanisms underlying impaired weight reduction for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus are multifactorial, and include energy conservation (i.e., improved glucose control and reduced glucosuria), hyperinsulinemia (commonly found in many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus), potential use of obesogenic anti-diabetes medications, and contributions from multiple body systems. Other factors include increased age, sex, genetic/epigenetic predisposition, and obesogenic environments.
Even though type 2 diabetes mellitus impairs weight reduction among patients with increased adiposity, clinically meaningful weight reduction improves glucose metabolism and can sometimes promote diabetes remission. An illustrative approach to mitigate impaired weight reduction due to type 2 diabetes mellitus is choosing anti-diabetes medications that increase insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss and deprioritize use of anti-diabetes medications that increase insulin exposure and promote weight gain.",type 2 diabetics

This was a retrospective database study using medical claims, pharmacy claims, and enrollment information from commercial and Medicare Advantage with Part D members in the Optum Research Database from 01/01/2011-2/29/2020. Adult patients with a claim for a weight management treatment from 01/01/2012-2/28/2019 were categorized into cohorts according to the highest intensity intervention received. To examine the association between patient characteristics and treatment modality received, a multinomial logit model was performed.
Cohorts by increasing intensity included lifestyle intervention (LSI, n = 67,679), weight reduction pharmacotherapy (WRRx) with an anti-obesity medication (AOM, n = 6,905), weight reduction procedure (WRP, n = 1,172), and weight reduction surgery (WRS, n = 18,036). Approximately 32.1% and 16.6% of patients who received WRS or WRP had an LSI during the 12-month baseline, and only 0.6% and 0.4% had treatment with long-term AOMs. In a multinomial logit model, patients with type 2 diabetes (not including WRRx cohort), respiratory disorders, cardiovascular risk factors, pain disorders, and mental health conditions had increased odds of treatment with higher intensity intervention versus LSI. Patients who were male, received an intervention more recently (2016-2019), or had a Charlson comorbidity score of 1 (compared to 0) had decreased odds of treatment with higher intensity interventions.
In this study, age, sex, body mass index, obesity-related complications, and Charlson comorbidity score appeared to influence the type of weight management treatment modality received. This study improves understanding of weight management treatment utilization and identifies gaps and opportunities to improve obesity care with the appropriate use of different treatment modalities.",type 2 diabetics

Twelve women and men with T2D were recruited and randomized to either a HP (30%protein, 30%fat, 40%carbohydrate) (n = 6) or HC (15%protein, 30%fat, 55%carbohydrate) (n = 6) diet feeding study for 6 months in this randomized controlled trial. All meals were purchased at local grocery stores and provided to subjects for 6 months with daily food menus for HP or HC compliance with weekly food pick-up and weight measurements. Oral glucose tolerance and meal tolerance tests with glucose and insulin measurements and DXA scans were done at baseline and after 6 months on the respective diets.
After 6 months on the HP diet, 100% of the subjects had remission of their T2DM to Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT), whereas only 16.6% of subjects on the HC diet had remission of their T2DM. The HP diet group exhibited significant improvement in a) cardiovascular risk factors (p = 0.004, b) inflammatory cytokines(p = 0.001), c) insulin sensitivity(p = 0.001), d) oxidative stress(p = 0.001), e) increased %lean body mass(p = 0.001) compared to the HC diet group at 6 months.

Weight-centric treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"['WissamGhusn', 'Maria DanielaHurtado', 'AndresAcosta']","Chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCD) represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most prevalent CNCD that is associated with a significant medical and economic burden. One of the main modifiable risk factors of T2DM is obesity. Many medications used for T2DM can lead to weight gain, worsening one of the root causes of this disease.
In this clinical review, we study the effect of medications for T2DM on body weight. We used MEDLINE, Google scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases to search for relevant studies between 1 January 1950 to 20 September 2022 in English language. Here, we review the most prescribed medications for T2DM and summarize their effect on patients' body weight. We will also present an expert opinion on a recommended weight-centric approach to treat T2DM.
Multiple T2DM medications have been associated with weight gain. Insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones and meglitinides may increase body weight. However, biguanides (e.g., metformin), glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide, tirzepatide), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, and amylin analogs (e.g., pramlintide) are associated with significant weight loss. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are considered weight neutral medications. Experts in the fields of endocrinology and obesity recommend utilizing a weight-centric approach when treating T2DM.
Considering the high prevalence and debilitating complication of T2DM, it is of utmost importance to shift from a weight gain approach (i.e., insulin, sulfonylureas) into a weight loss/neutral one (i.e., GLP-1 agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors, metformin).",type 2 diabetics

The study consisted of 3828 patients diagnosed with STEMI who underwent primer percutaneous coronary intervention. As the primary outcome, in-hospital mortality was defined as all-cause deaths during hospitalization. The included patients were categorized into three groups based on NPS (group 1:NPS = 0,1,2; group 2:NPS = 3; group 3:NPS = 4).
Increased NPS was associated with higher in-hospital mortality rates(P < 0.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the relationship between NPS and in-hospital mortality continued after adjustment for age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, Killip score, SBP, heart rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial infarction type and postprocedural no-reflow.

Association of oral care with periodontitis and glycemic control among US adults with diabetes.,"['YuqingZhang', 'Suzanne GLeveille', 'Sarah MCamhi', 'LingShi']","Studies indicate that treating periodontitis may benefit glycemic control among people with diabetes. It is unclear whether oral self-care such as flossing may reduce risk for periodontitis and improve glycemic control among people with diabetes. The purpose of this study was to examine associations between oral care, specifically, flossing and preventive dental care, with periodontitis and glycemic control, among US dentate adults with diabetes.
We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2011-2014 for 892 participants aged 30 years and older with diabetes who completed the periodontal examination and lab test for hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Sampling weights were applied. Multivariable logistic regression and multivariable linear modeling were performed to examine the associations of flossing and preventive dental services on periodontal health and HbA1c levels, respectively, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, health behaviors, and other risk factors.
Among U.S. dentate adults with diabetes, 52.1% of flossers and 72.1% of non-flossers had periodontitis (p < 0.001). Flossers were 39% less likely to have periodontitis (Adj.

Given the lifelong challenges that individuals with diabetes often encounter with managing their disease, many may slip into a conceding negative belief that their diabetes is ""too difficult to control"" or simply ""out of their hands,"" inhibiting proactive self-management efforts. Results from our study (n = 893) revealed that individuals with T2D had a significantly lower growth mindset towards their blood glucose level and lower self-efficacy towards their general health, blood glucose, and cholesterol levels compared to those without T2D. Among participants with T2D, further analyses showed a pattern of higher HbA1c among those with lower growth mindsets and self-efficacy toward their general health or blood glucose level.

Poor LDL-C control or dyslipidemia was associated with CVD, hypoglycemia, and elevated HbA1c and triglycerides levels. The presence of a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m
Gathered evidence supports the high clinical, economic and HRQoL burden of poor metabolic and/or weight control in PwT2D in Spain and reinforces the importance of prioritizing its control to reduce the associated burden, at both the individual and healthcare system levels.",type 2 diabetics
Investigating the relationship between inhibitory control and dietary adherence among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus based on subjective and objective measures.,"['NaLiu', 'ChunniHeng', 'YiCui', 'DiWu', 'LingLi', 'MenggeBai', 'YanxueGuo', 'WenWang', 'YinlingZhang']","Dietary management has been recommended as the cornerstone of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management. However, low adherence to dietary recommendations has been identified in both developed and developing countries. Previous research suggests that inhibitory control influences eating behavior, but few studies have been conducted in patients with T2DM. Thus, we aimed to explore the relationship between inhibitory control and dietary adherence among patients with T2DM.
A total of 393 patients with T2DM from the endocrinology departments of three tertiary hospitals in China were enrolled by the convenience sampling method. Dietary adherence was measured by the Dietary Behavior Adherence Scale for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Additionally, inhibitory control was subjectively measured by the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult version (BRIEF-A) and objectively assessed by the stop signal task (SST) and the Stroop task. The relationship between inhibitory control and dietary adherence was analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis and hierarchical regression analysis.
Subjectively measured inhibitory control had a significant predictive effect for dietary adherence after controlling for demographic and clinical variables. Adding the inhibitory control variable to the regression equation resulted in the following values: overall model F (19, 373) = 7.096, p < 0.001, increase in R
Inhibitory control was a predictor of dietary adherence in patients with T2DM. Future interventions should investigate whether inhibitory control training results in the improvement of dietary adherence in patients with T2DM.",type 2 diabetics
Update on N6-methyladenosine methylation in obesity-related diseases.,"['CaiqinCheng', 'FanYu', 'GuoyueYuan', 'JueJia']","Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that is closely related to type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and osteoarthritis. The prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly every year and is recognized as a global public health problem. In recent years, the role of epigenetics in the development of obesity and related diseases has been recognized and is currently a research hotspot. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is the most abundant epigenetic modification in the eukaryotic RNA, including mRNA and noncoding RNA. Several studies have shown that the m6A modifications in the target mRNA and the corresponding m6A regulators play a significant role in lipid metabolism and are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of obesity-related diseases. In this review, the latest research findings regarding the role of m6A methylation in obesity and related metabolic diseases are summarized. The authors' aim is to highlight evidence that suggests the clinical utility of m6A modifications and the m6A regulators as novel early prediction biomarkers and precision therapeutics for obesity and obesity-related diseases.",type 2 diabetics
Efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg according to antidepressant use at baseline: A post hoc subgroup analysis.,"['Robert FKushner', 'AndersFink-Jensen', 'OfirFrenkel', 'BarbaraMcGowan', 'BryanGoldman', 'MariaOvervad', 'ThomasWadden']","To explore the efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg in people with overweight/obesity who were also being treated with antidepressants (ADs).
Across the Semaglutide Treatment Effect for People with obesity (STEP) 1-3 and 5 trials, adults with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes (STEP 2 only) were enrolled. People with severe major depressive disorder within 2 years prior to screening or with a patient health questionnaire-9 score ≥15 at screening were excluded. Participants were categorized into subgroups according to baseline AD status (on/off ADs) in this post hoc exploratory analysis of the STEP trials.
Of 3683 participants randomized, 539 were on ADs at baseline. Mean body weight change from baseline to week 68 was greater for semaglutide versus placebo, regardless of baseline AD use. In STEP 1, for participants on ADs at baseline, mean change from baseline was -15.7% with semaglutide versus -0.2% with placebo and -14.7% versus -2.8% for those not on ADs at baseline. Similar patterns were seen in STEP 2, 3, and 5. The prevalence of adverse events (AEs) was generally similar between semaglutide and placebo in participants on ADs at baseline.
In adults with overweight/obesity, semaglutide provided clinically meaningful weight loss regardless of baseline AD use, with an AE profile consistent with previous studies.",type 2 diabetics
Identification of factors associated with the management of childhood obesity: Results from a French pediatric cohort study.,"['ArianeThevenard-Berger', 'Marie DiPatrizio', 'CaroleLegagneur', 'ArnaudWiedemann-Fode', 'EmelineRenard']","Childhood obesity is a real public health concern because of its association with a higher risk of adulthood obesity and comorbidities (metabolic, cardiovascular, etc.). The factors associated with the effectiveness of care are poorly described. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with body mass index (BMI) variation in the management of childhood obesity.
Children followed up for obesity in the Pediatric Endocrinology Department of the University Children Hospital of Nancy were included. Data were retrospectively collected in medical files. The characteristics of patients with a decrease in BMI (in standard deviation score, SDS) were compared with patients with an increased BMI (SDS)after 1 year of follow-up through univariate analysis.
Overall, 141 patients were included, and for 107 patients (55 girls and 52 boys) there were 1-year follow-up data. The mean BMI variation after 1 year of follow-up was-0.068 SD and for 63 patients (58.9%) there was a decrease in BMI SDS. Female patients (66% vs. 41%, p=0.012), hypercholesterolemia (33% vs. 4%, p=0.049), and type 1 diabetes (14% vs. 2%, p=0.019) were more frequent in patients with an unfavorable evolution of BMI SDS at 1 year. A family history of bariatric surgery (36% vs. 11%, p=0.042) or eating behavior disorders (76% vs. 24% of patients; p<0.001) or diabetes (1st or 2nd degree;81% vs. 60%, p=0.044) were also more frequent in children with an unfavorable evolution of BMI SDS at 1 year.
Several negative factors in the evolution of BMI were identified such as female sex, hypercholesterolemia, family history of bariatric surgery, or eating behavior. Early identification of these patients at risk of failure of obesity management is important to control BMI during childhood.",type 2 diabetics
Unraveling shared risk factors for diabetic foot ulcer: a comprehensive Mendelian randomization analysis.,"['KangliYin', 'TianciQiao', 'YongkangZhang', 'JiaruiLiu', 'YuzhenWang', 'FeiQi', 'JunlinDeng', 'ChengZhao', 'YongchengXu', 'YeminCao']","Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) stands as a severe diabetic lower extremity complication, characterized by high amputation rates, mortality, and economic burden. We propose using Mendelian randomization studies to explore shared and distinct risk factors for diabetic lower extremity complications.
We selected uncorrelated genetic variants associated with 85 phenotypes in five categories at the genome-wide significance level as instrumental variables. Genetic associations with DFU, diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), and diabetic peripheral artery disease (DPAD) were obtained from the FinnGen and UK Biobank studies.
Body mass index (BMI) emerged as the only significant risk factor for DPAD, DPN, and DFU, independent of type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and HbA1c. Educational attainment stood out as the sole significant protective factor against DPAD, DPN, and DFU. Glycemic traits below the type 2 diabetes diagnosis threshold showed associations with DPAD and DPN. While smoking history exhibited suggestive associations with DFU, indicators of poor nutrition, particularly total protein, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular volume, may also signal potential DFU occurrence.
Enhanced glycemic control and foot care are essential for the diabetic population with high BMI, limited education, smoking history, and indicators of poor nutrition. By focusing on these specific risk factors, healthcare interventions can be better tailored to prevent and manage DFU effectively.",type 2 diabetics
Prediction of Cardiovascular Complication in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Using an XGBoost/GRU-ODE-Bayes-Based Machine-Learning Algorithm.,"['JoonyubLee', 'YeraChoi', 'TaehoonKo', 'KanghyuckLee', 'JuyoungShin', 'Hun-SungKim']","Cardiovascular disease is life-threatening yet preventable for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Because each patient with T2DM has a different risk of developing cardiovascular complications, the accurate stratification of cardiovascular risk is critical. In this study, we proposed cardiovascular risk engines based on machine-learning algorithms for newly diagnosed T2DM patients in Korea.
To develop the machine-learning-based cardiovascular disease engines, we retrospectively analyzed 26,166 newly diagnosed T2DM patients who visited Seoul St. Mary's Hospital between July 2009 and April 2019. To accurately measure diabetes-related cardiovascular events, we designed a buffer (1 year), an observation (1 year), and an outcome period (5 years). The entire dataset was split into training and testing sets in an 8:2 ratio, and this procedure was repeated 100 times. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated by 10-fold cross-validation on the training dataset.
The machine-learning-based risk engines (AUROC XGBoost=0.781±0.014 and AUROC gated recurrent unit [GRU]-ordinary differential equation [ODE]-Bayes=0.812±0.016) outperformed the conventional regression-based model (AUROC=0.723± 0.036).
GRU-ODE-Bayes-based cardiovascular risk engine is highly accurate, easily applicable, and can provide valuable information for the individualized treatment of Korean patients with newly diagnosed T2DM.",type 2 diabetics
Acetylated Histone Modifications: Intersection of Diabetes and Atherosclerosis.,"['RunyangLiu', 'LihuaLi', 'ZhongqunWang', 'JieZhu', 'YuJi']","Worldwide, type 2 diabetes is predominant form of diabetes, and it is mainly affected by the environment. Furthermore, the offspring of patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic disorder syndrome may have a higher risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which indicates that the environmental impact on diabetes prevalence can be transmitted across generations. In the process of diabetes onset and intergenerational transmission, the genetic structure of the individual is not directly changed but is regulated by epigenetics. In this process, genes or histones are modified, resulting in selective expression of proteins. This modification will affect not only the onset of diabetes but also the related onset of atherosclerosis. Acetylation and deacetylation may be important regulatory factors for the above lesions. Therefore, in this review, based on the whole process of atherosclerosis evolution, we explored the possible existence of acetylation/deacetylation caused by diabetes. However, due to the lack of atherosclerosis-related acetylation studies directly based on diabetic models, we also used a small number of experiments involving nondiabetic models of related molecular mechanisms.",type 2 diabetics
Systemic biomarkers of microvascular alterations in type 1 diabetes associated neuropathy and nephropathy - A prospective long-term follow-up study.,"['EvangeliaBaldimtsi', 'Per AWhiss', 'JeanetteWahlberg']","This study aimed to investigate circulating biomarkers associated with the risk of developing diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and nephropathy in type 1 diabetes (T1D).
Patients with childhood-onset T1D (n = 49, age 38.3 ± 3.8 yrs.) followed prospectively were evaluated after 30 years of diabetes duration. DPN was defined as an abnormality in nerve conduction tests. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and its tissue inhibitor TIMP-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin-2 (NGAL), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), estimated GFR (eGFR), micro/macroalbuminuria and routine biochemistry were assessed. For comparison, control subjects were included (n = 30, age 37.9 ± 5.5 yrs.).
In all, twenty-five patients (51 %) were diagnosed with DPN, and nine patients (18 %) had nephropathy (five microalbuminuria and four macroalbuminuria). Patients with DPN had higher levels of TIMP-1 (p = 0.036) and sP-selectin (p = 0.005) than controls. Patients with DPN also displayed higher levels of TIMP-1 compared to patients without DPN (p = 0.035). Patients with macroalbuminuria had kidney disease stage 3 with lower eGFR, higher levels of TIMP-1 (p = 0.038), and NGAL (p = 0.002). In all patients, we found only weak negative correlations between eGFR and TIMP-1 (rho = -0.304, p = 0.040) and NGAL (rho = -0.277, p = 0.062, ns), respectively. MMP-9 was higher in patients with microalbuminuria (p = 0.021) compared with normoalbuminuric patients.
Our findings indicate that TIMP-1 and MMP-9, as well as sP-selectin and NGAL, are involved in microvascular complications in T1D. Monitoring and targeting these biomarkers may be a potential strategy for treating diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy.",type 2 diabetics
Assessment of clinical impact of SARS-CoV-2 in people with type 1 diabetes: A cohort study.,"['RubénCastillo-Ortega', 'JuanVega-Vargas', 'SamuelDurán-Aguero']","During the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, there had been more than 758 million COVID-19 cases as of February 13, 2023, and it is the main cause of death in many countries. Due to the variation in disease presentation, scientists determined that people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus were at higher risk of mortality. However, people living with type 1 diabetes have not been thoroughly studied, especially in extreme regions of developing countries. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic restrictions on different variables in a cohort with type 1 diabetes.
This cohort-type study included pediatric and adult patients with type 1 diabetes at Regional Hospital Dr. Juan Noé Crevani in Arica, Chile. Biosocial and anthropometric factors, clinical history, self-care activities, and biochemical parameters were assessed and compared using analysis of variance and paired t tests between March 2020 and March 2021.
A total of 150 patients were assessed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Arica, Chile. One year after the pandemic struck, the main causes for metabolic deterioration were a reduction of carbohydrate counting by an average of 8.67% (P = 0.000), a reduction of adherence to treatment by an average of 25% (P = 0.000), and a shift to telemedicine as a main health care service (P = 0.023); these factors raised hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by 1.81%, 1.78% and 0.075%, respectively. The participants' average body mass index (BMI) increased by 1.26 kg/m
This study found that adherence to diabetes care was reduced during the pandemic owing to a variety of behavioral reasons and environmental changes (e.g., quarantines and food security). This affected this population's HbA1c levels, BMI, linear growth, and number of hospitalizations as main consequences. Telemedicine remains an important tool, but it must be reconsidered among all different age groups.",type 2 diabetics
Euglycemic Ketoacidosis in Two Patients Without Diabetes After Introduction of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 Inhibitor for Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction.,"['Mahesh MUmapathysivam', 'JamesGunton', 'Steve NStranks', 'DavidJesudason']","Ketoacidosis induced by sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) treatment has been consistently observed in clinical practice in patients with type 2 diabetes despite minimal indication from the landmark cardiovascular outcome trials. It has been postulated that individuals without diabetes will not develop this complication due to an adequate insulin secretory capacity, which will protect against significant ketone formation. Cardiovascular outcome trials examining SGLT2i use in individuals with heart failure but not diabetes have not reported ketoacidosis.
We describe the first two case reports of severe nondiabetic ketoacidosis after initiation of an SGLT2i for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and we describe the management strategies employed and implication for the pathophysiology of SGLT2i-associated ketoacidosis.
Each individual presented with ketoacidosis triggered by reduced oral nutrition intake. For both individuals, ketoacidosis resolved with intravenous glucose administration, encouragement of consumption of oral glucose-containing fluid, and minimal insulin administration.
These two cases demonstrate that SGLT2i-associated ketoacidosis is possible in individuals without diabetes.",type 2 diabetics
Penetrance and expressivity of mitochondrial variants in a large clinically unselected population.,"['Stuart JCannon', 'TimothyHall', 'GarethHawkes', 'KevinColclough', 'Roisin MBoggan', 'Caroline FWright', 'Sarah JPickett', 'Andrew THattersley', 'Michael NWeedon', 'Kashyap APatel']","Whole genome sequencing (WGS) from large clinically unselected cohorts provides a unique opportunity to assess the penetrance and expressivity of rare and/or known pathogenic mitochondrial variants in population.
Using WGS from 179 862 clinically unselected individuals from the UK Biobank, we performed extensive single and rare variant aggregation association analyses of 15 881 mtDNA variants and 73 known pathogenic variants with 15 mitochondrial disease-relevant phenotypes.
We identified 12 homoplasmic and one heteroplasmic variant (m.3243A>G) with genome-wide significant associations in our clinically unselected cohort. Heteroplasmic m.3243A>G (MAF = 0.0002, a known pathogenic variant) was associated with diabetes, deafness and heart failure and 12 homoplasmic variants increased aspartate aminotransferase levels including three low-frequency variants (MAF ~0.002 and beta~0.3 SD). Most pathogenic mitochondrial disease variants (n = 66/74) were rare in the population (<1:9000). Aggregated or single variant analysis of pathogenic variants showed low penetrance in unselected settings for the relevant phenotypes, except m.3243A>G. Multi-system disease risk and penetrance of diabetes, deafness and heart failure greatly increased with m.3243A>G level ≥ 10%. The odds ratio of these traits increased from 5.61, 12.3 and 10.1 to 25.1, 55.0 and 39.5 respectively. Diabetes risk with m.3243A>G was further influenced by type 2 diabetes genetic risk.
Our study of mitochondrial variation in a large-unselected population identified novel associations and demonstrated that pathogenic mitochondrial variants have lower penetrance in clinically unselected settings. m.3243A>G was an exception at higher heteroplasmy showing a significant impact on health making it a good candidate for incidental reporting.",type 2 diabetics
"Lifestyle behaviours and associated factors among people with type 2 diabetes attending a diabetes clinic in Ningbo, China: A cross-sectional study.","['NaomiCarter', 'JialinLi', 'MiaoXu', 'LiLi', 'ShengnanXu', 'XuelanFan', 'ShuyanZhu', 'PritChahal', 'KaushikChattopadhyay']","The burden of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in China is significant and growing, and this is reflected in high rates of T2DM in the city of Ningbo, China. Consequent impacts on morbidity, mortality, healthcare expenditure, and health-related quality of life, make this a problem of the utmost importance to address. One way to improve T2DM outcomes is to address lifestyle behaviours that may affect prognosis and complications, such as physical activity levels, dietary habits, smoking status, and alcohol intake. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken to describe the prevalence of being physically active, having a healthy diet, currently smoking, and currently drinking alcohol among people living with T2DM attending a diabetes clinic in Ningbo, China. Regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with these lifestyle behaviours. We found a high prevalence of a healthy diet (97.8%, 95% CI 96.5-98.7%). Prevalence of being physically active (83.4%, 95% CI 80.6-85.9%), smoking (21.6%, 95% CI 18.8-24.6%), and alcohol drinking (32.9%. 95% CI 29.6-36.2%) appeared in keeping with those of the general population. Marked associations were demonstrated between male sex and smoking (OR 41.1, 95% CI 16.2-139.0), and male sex and alcohol drinking (OR 4.00, 95% CI 2.62-6.20). Correlation between lifestyle factors was demonstrated including between alcohol drinking and smoking, and between physical activity and reduced smoking. General diabetes self-management education programmes that address multiple lifestyle risk factors simultaneously may be beneficial in this population. Specific interventions targeting smoking cessation and reduction in alcohol drinking may be of benefit to men living with T2DM attending a diabetes clinic in Ningbo.",type 2 diabetics
Projected health and economic impacts of sugar-sweetened beverage taxation in Germany: A cross-validation modelling study.,"['Karl M FEmmert-Fees', 'BenAmies-Cull', 'NinaWawro', 'JakobLinseisen', 'MatthiasStaudigel', 'AnnettePeters', 'Linda JCobiac', ""MartinO'Flaherty"", 'PeterScarborough', 'ChrisKypridemos', 'MichaelLaxy']","Taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have been implemented globally to reduce the burden of cardiometabolic diseases by disincentivizing consumption through increased prices (e.g., 1 peso/litre tax in Mexico) or incentivizing industry reformulation to reduce SSB sugar content (e.g., tiered structure of the United Kingdom [UK] Soft Drinks Industry Levy [SDIL]). In Germany, where no tax on SSBs is enacted, the health and economic impact of SSB taxation using the experience from internationally implemented tax designs has not been evaluated. The objective of this study was to estimate the health and economic impact of national SSBs taxation scenarios in Germany.
In this modelling study, we evaluated a 20% ad valorem SSB tax with/without taxation of fruit juice (based on implemented SSB taxes and recommendations) and a tiered tax (based on the UK SDIL) in the German adult population aged 30 to 90 years from 2023 to 2043. We developed a microsimulation model (IMPACTNCD Germany) that captures the demographics, risk factor profile and epidemiology of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in the German population using the best available evidence and national data. For each scenario, we estimated changes in sugar consumption and associated weight change. Resulting cases of cardiometabolic disease prevented/postponed and related quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and economic impacts from healthcare (medical costs) and societal (medical, patient time, and productivity costs) perspectives were estimated using national cost and health utility data. Additionally, we assessed structural uncertainty regarding direct, body mass index (BMI)-independent cardiometabolic effects of SSBs and cross-validated results with an independently developed cohort model (PRIMEtime). We found that SSB taxation could reduce sugar intake in the German adult population by 1 g/day (95%-uncertainty interval [0.05, 1.65]) for a 20% ad valorem tax on SSBs leading to reduced consumption through increased prices (pass-through of 82%) and 2.34 g/day (95%-UI [2.32, 2.36]) for a tiered tax on SSBs leading to 30% reduction in SSB sugar content via reformulation. Through reductions in obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), 106,000 (95%-UI [57,200, 153,200]) QALYs could be gained with a 20% ad valorem tax and 192,300 (95%-UI [130,100, 254,200]) QALYs with a tiered tax. Respectively, €9.6 billion (95%-UI [4.7, 15.3]) and €16.0 billion (95%-UI [8.1, 25.5]) costs could be saved from a societal perspective over 20 years. Impacts of the 20% ad valorem tax were larger when additionally taxing fruit juice (252,400 QALYs gained, 95%-UI [176,700, 325,800]; €11.8 billion costs saved, 95%-UI [€6.7, €17.9]), but impacts of all scenarios were reduced when excluding direct health effects of SSBs. Cross-validation with PRIMEtime showed similar results. Limitations include remaining uncertainties in the economic and epidemiological evidence and a lack of product-level data.
In this study, we found that SSB taxation in Germany could help to reduce the national burden of noncommunicable diseases and save a substantial amount of societal costs. A tiered tax designed to incentivize reformulation of SSBs towards less sugar might have a larger population-level health and economic impact than an ad valorem tax that incentivizes consumer behaviour change only through increased prices.",type 2 diabetics
"Glycemic variability: Measurement, target, impact on complications of diabetes and does it really matter?","['YifeiMo', 'JingyiLu', 'JianZhou']","Over the past two decades, there has been continuous advancement in the accuracy and complexity of continuous glucose monitoring devices. Continuous glucose monitoring provides valuable insights into blood glucose dynamics, and can record glucose fluctuations accurately and completely. Glycemic variability (GV) is a straightforward measure of the extent to which a patient's blood glucose levels fluctuate between high peaks and low nadirs. Many studies have investigated the relationship between GV and complications, primarily in the context of type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, the exact contribution of GV to the development of diabetes complications remains unclear. In this literature review, we aimed to summarize the existing evidence regarding the measurement, target level, pathophysiological mechanisms relating GV and tissue damage, and population-based studies of GV and diabetes complications. Additionally, we introduce novel methods for measuring GV, and discuss several unresolved issues of GV. In the future, more longitudinal studies and trials are required to confirm the exact role of GV in the development of diabetes complications.",type 2 diabetics
Analysis of Mechanisms Underlying the Development of Endothelial Dysfunction and Functional Disorders in Experimental Diabetes Mellitus and Their Pathogenetic Correction.,"['S GDzugkoev', 'F SDzugkoeva', 'O IMargieva', 'A EKhubulova']","On the model of alloxan-induced diabetes mellitus in rats, the development of oxidative stress and violation of the NO-producing function of the endothelium and internal organs was established. Structural changes in the vascular endothelium due to increased level of atherogenic LDL preventing access of L-arginine to endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) contribute to the development of endothelial dysfunction, which is paralleled by oxidative modification of L-arginine and the formation of inhibitors of eNOS expression (asymmetric dimethylarginine, L-NAME). These findings are indicative of reduced eNOS expression in experimental diabetes mellitus. Administration of L-arginine and its combination with L-carnitine caused an increase in the production NO metabolites and eNOS expression levels by 2.13 and 3.8 times, respectively. In parallel, improvement in the electrolyte excretory function of the kidneys, an increase in the Na,K-ATPase activity in organ homogenates, and a decrease in organ-specific enzymes in blood plasma were observed, which indicates the effectiveness of the correction of the identified violations. A way to eliminate metabolic and functional disorders with combinations of L-arginine and L-carnitine is pathogenetically substantiated.

"Heterogeneity of increased biological age in type 2 diabetes correlates with differential tissue DNA methylation, biological variables, and pharmacological treatments.","['Briana NCortez', 'HuiPan', 'SamuelHinthorn', 'HanSun', 'NicolaNeretti', 'Anna LGloyn', 'CristinaAguayo-Mazzucato']","Biological age (BA) closely depicts age-related changes at a cellular level. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) accelerates BA when calculated using clinical biomarkers, but there is a large spread in the magnitude of individuals' age acceleration in T2D suggesting additional factors contributing to BA. Additionally, it is unknown whether BA can be changed with treatment. We hypothesized that potential determinants of the heterogeneous BA distribution in T2D could be due to differential tissue aging as reflected at the DNA methylation (DNAm) level, or biological variables and their respective therapeutic treatments. Publicly available DNAm samples were obtained to calculate BA using the DNAm phenotypic age (DNAmPhenoAge) algorithm. DNAmPhenoAge showed age acceleration in T2D samples of whole blood, pancreatic islets, and liver, but not in adipose tissue or skeletal muscle. Analysis of genes associated with differentially methylated CpG sites found a significant correlation between eight individual CpG methylation sites and gene expression. Clinical biomarkers from participants in the NHANES 2017-2018 and ACCORD cohorts were used to calculate BA using the Klemera and Doubal (KDM) method. Cardiovascular and glycemic biomarkers associated with increased BA while intensive blood pressure and glycemic management reduced BA to CA levels, demonstrating that accelerated BA can be restored in the setting of T2D.",type 2 diabetics
Current advancement in the preclinical models used for the assessment of diabetic neuropathy.,"['TanishkSaini', 'Papiya MitraMazumder']","Diabetic neuropathy is one of the prevalent and debilitating microvascular complications of diabetes mellitus, affecting a significant portion of the global population. Relational preclinical animal models are essential to understand its pathophysiology and develop effective treatments. This abstract provides an overview of current knowledge and advancements in such models. Various animal models have been developed to mimic the multifaceted aspects of human diabetic neuropathy, including both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These models involve rodents (rats and mice) and larger animals like rabbits and dogs. Induction of diabetic neuropathy in these models is achieved through chemical, genetic, or dietary interventions, such as diabetogenic agents, genetic modifications, or high-fat diets. Preclinical animal models have greatly contributed to studying the intricate molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying diabetic neuropathy. They have shed light on hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered neurotrophic factor signaling. Additionally, these models have allowed for the investigation of morphological changes, functional alterations, and behavioral manifestations associated with diabetic neuropathy. These models have also been crucial for evaluating the efficacy and safety of potential therapeutic interventions. Novel pharmacological agents, gene therapies, stem cell-based approaches, exercise, dietary modifications, and neurostimulation techniques have been tested using these models. However, limitations and challenges remain, including physiological differences between humans and animals, complex neuropathy phenotypes, and the need for translational validation. In conclusion, preclinical animal models have played a vital role in advancing our understanding and management of diabetic neuropathy. They have enhanced our knowledge of disease mechanisms, facilitated the development of novel treatments, and provided a platform for translational research. Ongoing efforts to refine and validate these models are crucial for future treatment developments for this debilitating condition.",type 2 diabetics

"TXNIP-NLRP3-GSDMD axis-mediated inflammation and pyroptosis of islet β-cells is involved in cigarette smoke-induced hyperglycemia, which is alleviated by andrographolide.","['WenchaoXu', 'HailanWang', 'QianSun', 'TianqiHua', 'JunBai', 'QingbiZhang', 'QizhanLiu', 'XinyeNi']","Epidemiologic surveys have indicated that cigarette smoking is an important risk factor for diabetes, but its mechanisms remain unclear. Andrographolide, an herb traditionally utilized in medicine, provides anti-inflammatory benefits for various diseases. In the present work, 265 patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) were investigated, and male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to cigareete smoke (CS) and/or to intraperitoneally injected andrographolide for 3 months. To elucidate the mechanism of CS-induced hyperglycemia and the protective mechanism of andrographolide, MIN6 cells were exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and/or to andrographolide. Our data from 265 patients with T2D showed that urinary creatinine and serum inflammatory cytokines (interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)) increased with smoking pack-years. In a mouse model, CS induced hyperglycemia, decreased insulin secretion, and elevated inflammation and pyroptosis in β-cells of mice. Treatment of mice with andrographolide preserved pancreatic function by reducing the expression of inflammatory cytokines; the expression of TXNIP, NLRP3, cleaved caspase 1, IL-1β; and the N-terminal of gasdermin D (GSDMD) protein. For MIN6 cells, CSE caused increasing secretion of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1β, and the expression of TXNIP and pyroptosis-related proteins; however, andrographolide alleviated these changes. Furthermore, silencing of TXNIP showed that the blocking effect of andrographolide may be mediated by TXNIP. In sum, our results indicate that CS induces hyperglycemia through TXNIP-NLRP3-GSDMD axis-mediated inflammation and pyroptosis of islet β-cells and that andrographolide is a potential therapeutic agent for CS-induced hyperglycemia.",type 2 diabetics

Downregulation of Exosomal hsa-miR-551b-3p in Obesity and Its Link to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"['Kseniia VDracheva', 'Irina APobozheva', 'Kristina AAnisimova', 'Stanislav GBalandov', 'Maria NGrunina', 'Zarina MHamid', 'Dmitriy IVasilevsky', 'Sofya NPchelina', 'Valentina VMiroshnikova']","Obesity is a significant risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Adipose tissue dysfunction can affect the pool of circulating exosomal miRNAs, driving concomitant disease in obesity. These exosomal miRNAs can reflect adipose tissue functionality, thus serving as prognostic biomarkers for disease monitoring in case of T2DM. In the present study, we conducted NanoString microRNA profiling of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by adipose tissue of obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 35) without T2DM and nonobese individuals (BMI < 30) as a control group. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis showed that miRNAs associated with obesity in this study were implicated in insulin signaling and insulin resistance biological pathways. Further, these microRNAs were screened in serum EVs in the following groups: (1) obese patients with T2DM, (2) obese patients without T2DM, and (3) nonobese individuals as a control group. has-miR-551b-3p was shown to be downregulated in adipose tissue EVs, as well as in serum EVs, of patients with obesity without T2DM. At the same time, the serum exosomal hsa-miR-551b-3p content was significantly higher in obese patients with T2DM when compared with obese patients without T2DM and may be a potential biomarker of T2DM development in obesity.",type 2 diabetics

There are contradictory findings in the literature regarding the relationship between glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the lipid profile among T2DM patients. This study was performed to investigate the association between HbA1c level and the lipid profile in elderly T2DM patients at a primary care hospital in Jeddah City, Saudi Arabia.
This study is a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted at the Prince Abdul Majeed Healthcare Center (PAMHC) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The sociodemographic and clinical data of the T2DM patients who had visited the PAMHC from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2021, were collected from the data registry of the PAMHC and analyzed for publication.
The study included a total of 988 T2DM patients (53.3% male). Of the participants, 42.9% were aged between 55 and 64 years. Dyslipidemia parameters were presented as high LDL-c (in 60.3% cases), low HDL-c (in 39.8% cases), high triglycerides (in 34.9% cases), and high total cholesterol (in 34.8% cases). The correlation of HbA1c with total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TGs) was positively significant, thereby highlighting the important link between glycemic control and dyslipidemia. A mean increase of 4.88 mg/dL and 3.33 mmHg in TG level and diastolic blood pressure, respectively, was associated with the male gender, in comparison to the female gender. However, the male gender was significantly associated with the reduction in the mean cholesterol level, BMI, HbA1c, HDL-c, and LDL-c by 11.49 mg/dL, 1.39 kg/m
The results of this study show that HbA1c was significantly associated with cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the T2DM patients included in the study. Our findings highlight the important relationship between glycemic control and dyslipidemia.",type 2 diabetics

MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane were searched for RCTs that assessed the effectiveness of real-time CGM (rt-CGM) or flash CGM (FGM) in adults (≥18 years) with T2DM that reported on at least 1 of the following outcomes: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), time in range, time in hyperglycemia, or time in hypoglycemia. The GRADE approach was used to assess certainty of evidence for primary outcomes.
Fourteen RCTs assessing CGM were included, with 825 patients in 9 RCTs using rt-CGM and 822 in 5 RCTs using FGM. Moderate certainty of evidence indicated that use of CGM had a modest but statistically significant reduction in HbA1c levels of about 0.32%. Our analyses of each device type separately showed similar reductions in HbA1c (0.34% and 0.33%, respectively, for rt-CGM and FGM), with trends for improvement in other glucose metrics favoring rt-CGM over self-monitored blood glucose.
Both rt-CGM and flash CGM led to modest but statistically significant declines in HbA1c among individuals with T2DM, with little heterogeneity in the results. However, the duration of the included RCTs was relatively short and few studies reported on important clinical outcomes, such as adverse events, emergency department use, or hospitalization. Longer term studies are needed to determine if the short-term improvements in glucose control leads to improvements in clinically important outcomes.",type 2 diabetics

In this study, type 2 diabetes (T2D), sex, and menopausal status were combined to refine the stratification of obesity regarding the risk of advanced SLD and gain further insight into disease physiopathology.
This study enrolled 1446 participants with obesity from the ABOS cohort (NCT01129297), who underwent extensive phenotyping, including liver histology and transcriptome profiling. Hierarchical clustering was applied to classify participants. The prevalence of metabolic disorders associated with steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis (F ≥ 2) was determined within each identified subgroup and aligned to clinical and biological characteristics.
The prevalence of NASH and F ≥ 2 was, respectively, 9.5% (N = 138/1446) and 11.7% (N = 159/1365) in the overall population, 20.3% (N = 107/726) and 21.1% (N = 106/502) in T2D patients, and 3.4% (N = 31/920) and 6.1% (N = 53/863) in non-T2D patients. NASH and F ≥ 2 prevalence was 15.4% (33/215) and 15.5% (32/206) among premenopausal women with T2D vs. 29.5% (33/112) and 30.3% (N = 36/119) in postmenopausal women with T2D (p < 0.01); and 21.0% (21/100) / 27.0% (24/89) in men with T2D ≥ age 50 years and 17.9% (17/95) / 18.5% (17/92) in men with T2D < age 50 years (NS).

Because this result may arise from the typically longer length of bypassed intestine in OAGB, here, the authors standardized the bypass length in RYGB and OAGB and compared weight loss and metabolic outcomes in a randomized controlled trial.
The authors randomized 121 bariatric patients to RYGB (n = 61) or OAGB (n = 60) in two Finnish University Hospitals and measured weight; body composition; metabolic features (insulin sensitivity, lipids, inflammation, nutrition); and comorbidities before and 6 and 12 months after the operation.
Total weight loss was similar in RYGB and OAGB at 6 months (mean: 21.2% [95% CI: 19.4-23.0] vs. 22.8% [95% CI: 21.5-24.1], p = 0.136) and 12 months (25.4% [95% CI: 23.4-27.5] vs. 26.1% [95% CI: 24.2-28.9], p = 0.635). Insulin sensitivity, lipids, and inflammation improved similarly between the groups (p > 0.05). Remission of type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia was marked and similar (p > 0.05) but the use of antihypertensive medications was lower (p = 0.037) and hypertension tended to improve more (p = 0.053) with RYGB versus OAGB at 12 months. Higher rates of vitamin D-25 deficiency (p < 0.05) and lower D-25 levels were observed with OAGB versus RYGB throughout the follow-up (p < 0.001). No differences in adverse effects were observed.
RYGB and OAGB were comparable in weight loss, metabolic improvement, remission of diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, and nutrition at 1-year follow-up. Vitamin D-25 deficiency was more prevalent with OAGB, whereas reduction in antihypertensive medications and hypertension was greater with RYGB. There is no need to change the current practices of RYGB in favor of OAGB.",type 2 diabetics

Nonetheless, the effects of sex on these outcomes remain unknown.
This open-label, non-inferiority, randomized study, conducted in 33 hospitals in South Korea, included 2,993 patients undergoing PCI with drug-eluting stents. Patients were randomly assigned to receive DAPT (aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) for three months then P2Y12 inhibitor alone for nine months, or DAPT for the entire 12 months. The primary endpoints were major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) 12 months after the index procedure. The bleeding endpoints were Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) bleeding types 2 to 5.
Of the patients, 795 (26.6%) were women, who were older and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia than men. The sexes exhibited comparable primary endpoints (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55-1.55; 
In both sexes undergoing PCI, P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after three months of DAPT achieved similar risks of the primary endpoints and the bleeding events compared with prolonged DAPT. Therefore, the benefits of early aspirin withdrawal with ongoing P2Y12 inhibitors may be comparable in women and men.

Effects of stopping criterion on the growth of trees in regression random forests.,"['AryanaArsham', 'PhilipRosenberg', 'MarkLittle']","Random forests are a powerful machine learning tool that capture complex relationships between independent variables and an outcome of interest. Trees built in a random forest are dependent on several hyperparameters, one of the more critical being the node size. The original algorithm of Breiman, controls for node size by limiting the size of the parent node, so that a node cannot be split if it has less than a specified number of observations. We propose that this hyperparameter should instead be defined as the minimum number of observations in each terminal node. The two existing random forest approaches are compared in the regression context based on estimated generalization error, bias-squared, and variance of resulting predictions in a number of simulated datasets. Additionally the two approaches are applied to type 2 diabetes data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We have developed a straightforward method for incorporating weights into the random forest analysis of survey data. Our results demonstrate that generalization error under the proposed approach is competitive to that attained from the original random forest approach when data have large random error variability.

Reducing starch digestibility of white rice by structuring with hydrocolloids.,"['SyahrizalMuttakin', 'SerafimBakalis', 'Peter JFryer', 'Norah AAlshammari', 'LucaMarciani', 'OuraniaGouseti']","Controlling starch digestion in high glycaemic index staple foods such as white rice is of interest as it has been associated with reduced risk for conditions such as obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Addition of hydrocolloids has been proposed to reduce the rate of post-prandial glucose by controlling the rate of starch hydrolysis. In this work, the potential of a range of hydrocolloids to modify starch digestibility when added (at 1 % maximum concentration) during cooking of white rice was first investigated. Low acyl gellan gum (LAG) showed the highest potential (in-vitro estimated Glycaemic Index reduced by about 20 %, from 94 in the control to 78 in the LAG rice) and was investigated further. While the grains of rice control and rice with LAG appeared similar, SEM images revealed a gel-like layer (a few micrometers in thickness) on the surface of the treated samples. Addition of LAG appeared to also have an effect on the breakdown of a simulated cm-sized bolus. During gastric digestion, bolus breakdown of the rice control was completed after 30 min, while the rice LAG bolus appeared intact after 1 h of observation. This was attributed to strengthening of the LAG gel in the acidic environment of the stomach. During intestinal digestion, rice samples containing 1 % LAG appeared to be less susceptible to breakdown when seen under a microscope and in environmental SEM, while they showed larger rice particle aggregates, compared to rice control. Overall, LAG showed potential to control starch digestion kinetics of white rice with a mechanism that may involve formation of a protective layer on the rice grains (um) that reduces bolus break down (cm) and enzymatic hydrolysis (nm). Outcomes of this work will be used to identify conditions for further relevant in-vitro and in-vivo investigations.",type 2 diabetics

To date, it remains largely unclear how regulating the pH during thermal processing alters the microstructure and digestion features of starch-based matrix including protein hydrolysates. Considering this, corn starch (CS) and soybean protein isolate (SPI) (or its hydrolysates (SPIH)) were used to prepare thermally-processed CS-SPI and CS-SPIH binary matrices under different pH values (3 to 9), followed by inspection of changes in the structures and digestibility using combined methods. It was found that including SPI (especially SPIH) caused structural changes of those binary systems, such as reduced network sizes, increased V-crystals and reduced nanoscale structures, which could allow more resistant starch (RS). This phenomenon was especially true when including SPIH with regulated pH value. For instance, SPIH inclusion at pH 5 caused the highest RS content (about 20.30%), presumably linked to the reduced molecule size of SPIH with strengthened aggregation at pH 5. In contrast, the acidic (pH 3) and alkaline (pH 9) conditions allowed reduced short-range orders and tailored porous networks and thus less RS (ca. 17.46% at pH 3 and 16.74% at pH 9).",type 2 diabetics

Our investigation tested the hypothesis that Hass avocado oil, a monounsaturated fatty acid and a source of phytosterol, may improve liver and metabolic parameters without adverse effects when combined with physical exercise. Rats ingested a high-fat diet for seven weeks and were then subjected to more six weeks with a standard diet, Hass avocado-oil ingestion, and swimming.

Liver tissue markers of apoptosis and necrosis such as CK-18 filaments and dimethylamine (DMA) were significantly higher in the intervention group (P < 0.05). We were unable to fully confirm our hypothesis. Although the synergistic effects between Hass avocado-oil and the swimming regimen offer a promising chance of recovering liver health by improving 10 health biological markers, we must not ignore the cellular damage due to apoptosis and necrosis in liver cells and DMA.

We used network pharmacology and molecular docking to explore the potential mechanism of action of HBCS against type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Fifty-five active components from HBCS interfered with T2DM. Twenty-five core targets, such as AKT1, INS, INSR, MAPK1 were identified. Enrichment analyses showed that HBCS was involved mainly including insulin receptor signaling pathway, extracellular region, and insulin-like growth factor receptor binding and other biological processes; common targets had roles in treating T2DM by regulating diabetic cardiomyopathy and insulin resistance. Molecular docking verified that components combined with core targets. HBCS play a part in treating T2DM through multiple components and targets at the molecular level, which lays a theoretical foundation for research using HBCS to treat T2DM. The components, predicted targets, and T2DM targets of HBCS were searched through databases, and common targets were determined. Further screening of the core targets was conducted through the establishment of a protein -protein interaction network. The core targets were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) annotation utilizing the DAVID platform. And the enrichment of signaling pathways was explored by employing the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database.

Reductions in liver enzymes are associated with anti-hyperglycaemic and anti-obesity effects of tofogliflozin in people with type 2 diabetes: Post-hoc analyses.,"['ToshinariTakamura', 'KoheiKaku', 'AkihiroYoshida', 'HiromiKusakabe', 'HiroyukiNakamura', 'HidekiSuganami']","How the pathology of type 2 diabetes (T2D), including hyperglycaemia and obesity, affects liver enzymes has not been clinically demonstrated. Thus, we compared time courses of gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) with those of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight (BW) during treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor tofogliflozin for T2D.
We post-hoc analysed preexisting data on 1046 people with T2D administered tofogliflozin or placebo for 24 weeks in four tofogliflozin studies. First, time courses of percent changes in variables during the intervention were analysed using a mixed effect model to explore the similarity of the time courses and to evaluate time-treatment interactions. Second, clinical factors related to the percent changes in GGT and ALT were clarified using multivariate analyses.
GGT levels and FPG values rapidly and significantly decreased via tofogliflozin as early as week 4, with decreases maintained until week 24. Conversely, BW and ALT decreased progressively until week 24. Time courses of FPG (p = .365, time-treatment interaction) and GGT (p = .510) reductions were parallel between tofogliflozin and placebo from weeks 4 to 24, while BW and ALT reductions (p < .001, respectively) were not. Reductions in GGT at week 24 were associated with reductions in FPG and BW at week 24, whereas ALT reductions were only associated with reductions in BW.
Reductions in GGT and ALT were associated with the anti-hyperglycaemic and anti-obesity effects of tofogliflozin, respectively, in people with T2D. Therefore, GGT and ALT may be surrogate markers for hyperglycaemia and obesity in T2D.",type 2 diabetics

ROC curve analysis revealed that SII and AISI exhibited a high discriminatory capability for identifying TNs in the overall and male participant group, whereas the significance among females was not discernible.
This study provides evidence that SII and AISI are independent risk factors for TNs, suggesting that elevated SII and AISI levels may contribute to the development of TNs in patients with T2DM particularly among male individuals.",type 2 diabetics
"Integration of point-of-care screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension into the COVID-19 vaccine programme in Johannesburg, South Africa.","['Alana TBrennan', 'BeatriceVetter', 'Sithabiso DMasuku', 'BukelwaMtshazo', 'NkuliMashabane', 'SimisoSokhela', 'Willem DfVenter', 'KekeletsoKao', 'GesineMeyer-Rath']","South Africa grapples with a substantial burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), particularly type 2 diabetes (diabetes) and hypertension. However, these conditions are often underdiagnosed and poorly managed, further exacerbated by the strained primary healthcare (PHC) system and the disruptive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating NCD screening with large-scale healthcare initiatives, such as COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, offers a potential solution, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of this integration.
A prospective cohort study was conducted at four government health facilities in Johannesburg, South Africa. NCD screening was incorporated into the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Participants underwent COVID-19 rapid tests, blood glucose checks, blood pressure assessments, and anthropometric measurements. Those with elevated blood glucose or blood pressure values received referrals for diagnostic confirmation at local PHC centers.
Among 1,376 participants screened, the overall diabetes prevalence was 4.1%, combining previously diagnosed cases and newly identified elevated blood glucose levels. Similarly, the hypertension prevalence was 19.4%, comprising pre-existing diagnoses and newly detected elevated blood pressure cases. Notably, 46.1% of participants displayed waist circumferences indicative of metabolic syndrome, more prevalent among females. Impressively, 7.8% of all participants screened were potentially newly diagnosed with diabetes or hypertension. Approximately 50% of individuals with elevated blood glucose or blood pressure successfully linked to follow-up care within four weeks.
Our study underscores the value of utilizing even brief healthcare interactions as opportunities for screening additional health conditions, thereby aiding the identification of previously undiagnosed cases. Integrating NCD screenings into routine healthcare visits holds promise, especially in resource-constrained settings. Nonetheless, concerted efforts to strengthen care linkage are crucial for holistic NCD management and control. These findings provide actionable insights for addressing the NCD challenge and improving healthcare delivery in LMICs.",type 2 diabetics
Dietary Diabetes Risk Reduction Score (DDRRS) and Breast Cancer Risk: A Case-Control Study in Iran.,"['MiladMohammadzadeh', 'AlirezaBahrami', 'FatemehAbdi', 'FatemehGhafouri-Taleghani', 'AminPaydareh', 'SabaJalali', 'ZeinabHeidari', 'BahramRashidkhani']","Given the role of type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance in tumor initiation, we hypothesized that following a diet that reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes could also reduce the risk of breast cancer. Herein, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between dietary diabetes risk reduction score and breast cancer risk in Iranian women.
We recruited 136 newly diagnosed cases and 272 age-matched hospitalized controls from referral hospitals. A valid and reliable 168-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to collect the data on dietary intake. We used Multivariate Logistic regression to assess the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) of breast cancer by the dietary diabetes risk reduction score tertiles.
After adjusting for confounding variables, no association was seen between dietary diabetes risk reduction score and breast cancer risk (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.37-1.14). However, after stratification by menopausal status, a decreased risk was observed between adherence to dietary diabetes risk reduction score and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal individuals (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.19-0.99).
The present study states that there is no significant relationship between the dietary diabetes risk reduction score and the risk of breast cancer. However, adherence to dietary diabetes risk reduction score could have a preventive role for breast cancer among postmenopausal women.",type 2 diabetics

Because there are still high numbers of patients with HF who are undiagnosed and untreated, there is a need for improving efforts to better identify HF in patients with DM with or without MASLD. This study aims to develop machine learning (ML) models for assessing the risk of the HF occurrence in patients with DM with and without MASLD.
In the Silesia Diabetes-Heart Project (NCT05626413), patients with DM with and without MASLD were analyzed to identify the most important HF risk factors with the use of a ML approach. The multiple logistic regression (MLR) classifier exploiting the most discriminative patient's parameters selected by the χ2 test following the Monte Carlo strategy was implemented. The classification capabilities of the ML models were quantified using sensitivity, specificity, and the percentage of correctly classified (CC) high- and low-risk patients.
We studied 2000 patients with DM (mean age 58.85 ± SD 17.37 years; 48% women). In the feature selection process, we identified 5 parameters: age, type of DM, atrial fibrillation (AF), hyperuricemia and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In the case of MASLD( +) patients, the same criterion was met by 3 features: AF, hyperuricemia and eGFR, and for MASLD(-) patients, by 2 features: age and eGFR. Amongst all patients, sensitivity and specificity were 0.81 and 0.70, respectively, with the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95% CI 0.82-0.86).
A ML approach demonstrated high performance in identifying HF in patients with DM independently of their MASLD status, as well as both in patients with and without MASLD based on easy-to-obtain patient parameters.",type 2 diabetics

Population Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis of the Glucokinase Activator PB201 in Healthy Volunteers and Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Facilitating the Clinical Development of PB201 in China.,"['LingSong', 'FangruiCao', 'ShuNiu', 'MichaelXu', 'RuifangLiang', 'KeDing', 'ZhigangLin', 'XuetingYao', 'DongyangLiu']","PB201 is an orally active, partial glucokinase activator targeting both pancreatic and hepatic glucokinase. As the second glucokinase activator studied beyond phase I, PB201 has demonstrated promising glycemic effects as well as favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aims to develop a population PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) model for PB201 using the pooled data from nine phase I/II clinical trials conducted in non-Chinese healthy volunteers and a T2DM population and to predict the PK/PD profile of PB201 in a Chinese T2DM population. We developed the PK/PD model using the non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach. All runs were performed using the first-order conditional estimation method with interaction. The pharmacokinetics of PB201 were well fitted by a one-compartment model with saturable absorption and linear elimination. The PD effects of PB201 on reducing the fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in the T2DM population were described by indirect response models as stimulating the elimination of fasting plasma glucose, where the production of glycosylated hemoglobin was assumed to be stimulated by fasting plasma glucose. Covariate analyses revealed enhanced absorption of PB201 by food and decreased systemic clearance with ketoconazole co-administration, while no significant covariate was identified for the pharmacodynamics. The population PK model established for non-Chinese populations was shown to be applicable to the Chinese T2DM population as verified by the PK data from the Chinese phase I study. The final population PK/PD model predicted persistent and dose-dependent reductions in fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels in the Chinese T2DM population receiving 50/50 mg, 100/50 mg, and 100/100 mg PB201 twice daily for 24 weeks independent of co-administration of metformin. Overall, the proposed population PK/PD model quantitatively characterized the PK/PD properties of PB201 and the impact of covariates on its target populations, which allows the leveraging of extensive data in non-Chinese populations with the limited data in the Chinese T2DM population to successfully supported the waiver of the clinical phase II trial and facilitate the optimal dose regimen design of a pivotal phase III study of PB201 in China.",type 2 diabetics

The association between alcohol drinking and glycemic management among people with type 2 diabetes in China.,"['QingYe', 'XiaojunOuyang', 'ZhenzhenQin', 'YijiaChen', 'XueningZhang', 'YeLiu', 'QinglinLou', 'FeiXu']","To investigate the association between alcohol drinking and glycemic management among adult patients with type 2 diabetes in regional China.
In this cross-sectional survey conducted in Nanjing Municipality of China in 2018, adult type 2 diabetes patients were randomly selected from urban and rural communities.

Mixed-effects regression models were employed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for examining the associations of alcohol drinking with glycemic management among type 2 diabetes patients.
Among the overall 5,663 participants, the glycemic management rate was 39.8% (95% CI = 38.5, 41.1), with 41.2% (95% CI = 39.7, 42.7), 43.9% (95% CI = 38.9, 48.8), and 34.1% (95% CI = 31.5, 36.7) for non-drinkers, mild/moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers, respectively.

Butyrate functions as a histone deacetylase inhibitor to protect pancreatic beta cells from IL-1β-induced dysfunction.,"['Signe SchultzPedersen', 'Lars RoedIngerslev', 'MathiasOlsen', 'MichalaPrause', 'NilsBillestrup']","Butyrate, a gut microbial metabolite, has beneficial effects on glucose homeostasis and has become an attractive drug candidate for type 2 diabetes (T2D). Recently, we showed that butyrate protects pancreatic beta cells against cytokine-induced dysfunction. In this study, we explored the underlying mechanisms of butyrate action. Pancreatic mouse islets were exposed to a non-cytotoxic concentration of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) for ten days to mimic low-grade inflammation in T2D. Similar to the effect of butyrate, an isoform-selective histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibitor normalized IL-1β-reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and insulin content. In contrast, free fatty acid receptor 2 and 3 (FFAR2/3) agonists failed to normalize IL-1β-induced beta cell dysfunction. Furthermore, butyrate inhibited HDAC activity and increased the acetylation of histone H3 and H4 by 3- and 10-fold, respectively. Genome-wide analysis of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) revealed that butyrate mainly increased H3K27ac at promoter regions (74 %), while H3K27ac peaks regulated by IL-1β were more equally distributed at promoters (38 %), introns (23 %) and intergenic regions (23 %). Gene ontology analysis showed that butyrate increased IL-1β-reduced H3K27ac levels near several genes related to hormone secretion and reduced IL-1β-increased H3K27ac levels near genes associated with inflammatory responses. Butyrate alone increased H3K27ac near many genes related to MAPK signaling, hormone secretion and differentiation, and decreased H3K27ac at genes involved in cell replication. Together, these results suggest that butyrate prevents IL-1β-induced pancreatic islet dysfunction by inhibition of HDACs resulting in changes in H3K27ac levels at genes relevant for beta cell function and inflammatory responses.",type 2 diabetics

Alzheimer's disease-related brain insulin resistance and the prospective therapeutic impact of metformin.,"['Hamed AAbosharaf', 'YasminElsonbaty', 'EhabTousson', 'TarekM Mohamed']","Besides COVID-19, two of the most critical outbreaks of our day are insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Each disease's pathophysiology is well established. Furthermore, a substantial overlap between them has coexisted. Uncertainty remains on whether T2DM and AD are parallel illnesses with the same origin or separate illnesses linked through violent pathways. The current study was aimed at testing whether the insulin resistance in the brain results in AD symptoms or not. Insulin resistance was induced in the brains of rats using a single intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ) dose. We then measured glucose, insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS-2), amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, and tau phosphorylation in the brain to look for signs of insulin resistance and AD. The results of this study indicated that a single dose of STZ was able to induce insulin resistance in the brain and significantly decline IRS-2. This resistance was accompanied by obvious memory loss, Aβ deposition, and tau phosphorylation, further visible diminishing in neurotransmitters such as dopamine and acetylcholine. Furthermore, oxidative stress was increased due to the antioxidant system being compromised. Interestingly, the pancreas injury and peripheral insulin resistance coexisted with brain insulin resistance. Indeed, the antidiabetic metformin was able to enhance all these drastic effects. In conclusion, brain insulin resistance could lead to AD and vice versa. These are highly linked syndromes that could influence peripheral organs.

Research indicates that providers find it challenging to engage adolescents in communication exchanges during triadic encounters in diabetes clinics. Our study aimed to explore adolescents, parents, and providers' experiences of clinic encounters.
A qualitative study was conducted with a convenience sample of 13 adolescents with Type 1 diabetes (aged 11-17), 14 parents, and seven providers. Participants were recruited from two outpatient diabetes clinics in two urban children's hospitals, Ireland. Data were obtained using a combination of interviews and focus groups. Data were analysed thematically.
Adolescents and their parents appeared to hold both positive and negative experiences of diabetes clinic encounters. Providers reported challenges associated with engaging adolescents in communication exchanges. The structure, focus and style of clinic encounters created barriers that potentially led to suboptimal adolescent participation and impaired provider-adolescent communication during clinic visits.
The findings provide insights into the challenges associated with adolescents' engagement in communication encounters in diabetes clinics. Healthcare providers could encourage adolescents to be more actively involved in their diabetes management, by taking an adolescent-centred approach and creating a nonjudgemental milieu. Focusing on adolescent's agenda could lead to more meaningful and relevant discussions between providers and adolescents and ensure more tailored education in the time available. Adolescence is a risky period for nonadherence and adverse health complications; therefore, it is critical that providers make every contact count in diabetes clinic encounters.

Once weekly insulin Icodec as compared to once daily basal insulins: A Meta-analysis.,"['PradipMukhopadhyay', 'PurushottamChatterjee', 'KaushikPandit', 'DebmalyaSanyal', 'SujoyGhosh']","Once-weekly basal insulin icodec has been tested in clinical trials for efficacy and safety over currently available glargine-100 and degludec in different clinical settings in type 2 diabetes. We performed this meta-analysis to evaluate its overall safety and efficacy as compared to glargine-100 and degludec (non-icodec), from all available RCTs.
Seven trials comparing once-daily basal insulin analogues to once-weekly basal insulin icodec were included. Based on available informations, outcome in terms of HbA1c, FPG (fasting plasma glucose) reduction, and increase in TIR (time in range) were compared. Side-effects were compared for overall hypoglycaemia, severe hypoglycaemia and weight gain. The pooled effect-size for continuously distributed data was measured as reduction in 'estimated differences in mean (with 95% CI)'. For categorical data pooled effect-size was measured as Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio (with 95% CI).
Analysed against the non-icodec comparators together, the 'estimated mean changes' in HbA1c and FPG favoring icodec were -0.22% (-0.35, -0.10) and -1.59 mg% (-9.26, 6.08) respectively. The 'estimated mean increment' in weight for icodec was 0.64Kg ( 0.61, 0.67). The 'estimated mean percentage' increment for TIR in icodec was 4.24% ( 2.99, 5.49). The MH risk ratio for all hypoglycaemic events and severe hypoglycaemia for icodec was 1.24 (1.02, 1.50) (P=0.03) and 0.81 ( 0.31, 2.08).

On the wake of metformin: Do anti-diabetic SGLT2 inhibitors exert anti-aging effects?,"['LuciaScisciola', 'FabiolaOlivieri', 'ConcettaAmbrosino', 'MichelangelaBarbieri', 'Maria RosariaRizzo', 'GiuseppePaolisso']","Here we propose that SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), a class of drugs primarily used to treat type 2 diabetes, could also be repositioned as anti-aging senomorphic drugs (agents that prevent the extrinsic harmful effects of senescent cells). As observed for metformin, another anti-diabetic drug with established anti-aging potential, increasing evidence suggests that SGLT2i can modulate some relevant pathways associated with the aging process, such as free radical production, cellular energy regulation through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), autophagy, and the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB/inflammasome. Some interesting pro-healthy effects were also observed on human microbiota. All these mechanisms converge on fueling a systemic proinflammatory condition called inflammaging, now recognized as the main risk factor for accelerated aging and increased risk of age-related disease development and progression. Inflammaging can be worsened by cellular senescence and immunosenescence, which contributes to the increased burden of senescent cells during aging, perpetuating the proinflammatory condition. Interestingly, increasing evidence suggested the direct effects of SGLT-2i against senescent cells, chronic activation of immune cells, and metabolic alterations induced by overnutrition (meta-inflammation). In this framework, we analyzed and discussed the multifaceted impact of SGLT2i, compared with metformin effects, as a potential anti-aging drug beyond diabetes management. Despite promising results in experimental studies, rigorous investigations with well-designed cellular and clinical investigations will need to validate SGLT2 inhibitors' anti-aging effects.",type 2 diabetics
Comparative analysis of kinetic realizations of insulin signaling.,"['Patrick Vincent NLubenia', 'Eduardo RMendoza', 'Angelyn RLao']","Several studies have developed dynamical models to understand the underlying mechanisms of insulin signaling, a signaling cascade that leads to the translocation of glucose, the human body's main source of energy. Fortunately, reaction network analysis allows us to extract properties of dynamical systems without depending on their model parameter values. This study focuses on the comparison of insulin signaling in healthy state (INSMS or INSulin Metabolic Signaling) and in type 2 diabetes (INRES or INsulin RESistance) using reaction network analysis. The analysis uses network decomposition to identify the different subsystems involved in insulin signaling (e.g., insulin receptor binding and recycling, GLUT4 translocation, and ERK signaling pathway, among others). Furthermore, results show that INSMS and INRES are similar with respect to some network, structo-kinetic, and kinetic properties. Their differences, however, provide insights into what happens when insulin resistance occurs. First, the variation in the number of species involved in INSMS and INRES suggests that when irregularities occur in the insulin signaling pathway, other complexes (and, hence, other processes) get involved, characterizing insulin resistance. Second, the loss of concordance exhibited by INRES suggests less restrictive interplay between the species involved in insulin signaling, leading to unusual activities in the signaling cascade. Lastly, GLUT4 losing its absolute concentration robustness in INRES may signify that the transporter has lost its reliability in shuttling glucose to the cell, inhibiting efficient cellular energy production. This study also suggests possible applications of the equilibria parametrization and network decomposition, resulting from the analysis, to potentially establish absolute concentration robustness in a species.",type 2 diabetics

Effects of total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) on the treatment of diabetic nephropathy via the activation of solute carriers in renal tubular epithelial cells.,"['HongmeiYu', 'HaitaoTang', 'MeiWang', 'QingXu', 'JinshiYu', 'HaitaoGe', 'LeiQiang', 'WeiTang', 'Harvest FGu']","As a traditional Chinese medicine, Huangkui capsule (HKC) has been used to treat patients with kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy (DN). We have recently demonstrated that HKC could re-regulate the activities of solute carriers (SLC)s in proximal and distal convoluted tubules of kidneys in regression of the development of DN. The main active chemical constituents of HKC are the flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (L.). The current study aims to further evaluate the efficacy of total flavones of A. manihot (TFA) in the regression of DN by analyzing SLC activities in proximal and distal convoluted tubules of kidneys. TFA (0.076 g/kg/d) or vehicle was administered in db/db mice, the animal model of type 2 diabetes and DN, daily via oral gavage for four weeks. Blood glucose levels and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured and used for the determination of T2D and DN. Ten SLCs, including slc2a2, slc4A1, slc5a2, slc5A3, slc5a8, slc6a20, slc27a2, slc12a3, slc34a1 and slc38a2 were highly expressed in proximal and distinct convoluted tubules of kidneys. Their expression at mRNA and protein levels before and after TFA treatment were analyzed with real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Data showed that UACR in the db/db mice after TFA treatment was significantly decreased. Compared with the group of non-diabetic control, slc2a2, slc4A1, slc5a2, slc5A3, slc5a8, slc6a20, slc27a2, slc12a3, slc34a1 and slc38a2 in the group of DN were down-regulated but up-regulated after TFA treatment. Further analyses of whole kidney sections indicated that the numbers and structures of the nephron in db/db mice was increased and improved after TFA treatment. Thereby, the current study provides further evidence that the flavones in A. manihot have pharmacological effects on the treatment of DN by improving the biological function of SLCs in kidneys.",type 2 diabetics
Differences in serum selenoprotein P profile between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice fed high-fat diet.,"['MotozumiAndo', 'KeikoSuzuki', 'RikoKitamoto', 'AyakoNakayama', 'NorioWatanabe', 'MasamiKawahara']","C57BL/6 mice generally show hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance when fed a high-fat diet (HFD) compared to those of BALB/c mice. However, whether these strains also show different expression profiles of selenoprotein P, a diabetes-related hepatokine, after HFD feeding is unclear. We investigated the effects of HFD on body weight, glucose metabolism, and plasma selenoprotein P levels in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice.
Male C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice aged seven weeks were divided into normal diet (ND) and HFD groups. Fasting body weights and blood sugar levels were measured weekly. Blood specimens were collected after 16 h of fasting (in weeks 7, 9, and 11) and after 24 h of subsequent refeeding (in weeks 9 and 11) to analyse plasma selenoprotein P and insulin levels.
The mean body weight of the HFD group was consistently higher than that of the ND group for both strains. However, a significant elevation in fasting plasma glucose levels from the early stage was observed only in the HFD group of C57BL/6 mice. In BALB/c mice, a difference in fasting glucose levels between the HFD and ND groups was observed after nine weeks. After seven, nine, and eleven weeks, the fasting plasma insulin levels were higher in the HFD group than in the ND group for both strains. During this period, plasma selenoprotein P levels in the HFD group were significantly higher than those in the ND group of C57BL/6 mice. However, BALB/c mice did not show a significant difference in plasma levels of selenoprotein P between the ND and HFD groups. After refeeding, the plasma insulin and selenoprotein P levels increased compared to those observed during fasting in the ND group for both strains. Elevation of insulin levels, but not of selenoprotein P levels, after refeeding was noticed in the HFD group for both strains. Plasma selenoprotein P level after refeeding was significantly lower than that during fasting in the HFD group of C57BL/6 mice.
Unlike C57BL/6 mice, BALB/c mice did not show elevated fasting plasma selenoprotein P levels despite HFD feeding. Additionally, the pattern of selenoprotein P levels in the plasma after refeeding differed between C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. These differences in selenoprotein P expression among strains may be related to different susceptibilities of individuals to diabetes.",type 2 diabetics

What are the childbearing experiences of women with type 1 diabetes? A scoping review of qualitative literature.,"['JennyRoddy', 'LindaMcGowan']","Type 1 diabetes is associated with the risk of adverse outcomes for mother and baby.
How pregnant people adapt to the challenges of type 1 diabetes and engage with healthcare professionals can affect how likely they will be to maintain good glycaemic control. Therefore, it is important to understand the childbearing and care experiences of women with type 1 diabetes.
To examine contemporary literature describing the childbearing experiences of women with type 1 diabetes over the last decade.
The review follows 5 stages of Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework. Four databases were searched for English language publications 2012-2023 using indexed terms and Boolean operators. 64 studies were retrieved, 10 included in the review. Braun and Clarke's thematic synthesis process was used to collate findings.

"Family-Based, Culturally Responsive Intervention for Chinese Americans With Diabetes: Lessons Learned From a Literature Review to Inform Study Design and Implementation.","['Wen-WenLi', 'JacquelineTong']","The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is very high, and Chinese peoples with diabetes are estimated to comprise 50% of the total cases. Rates of diabetes continue to rise among Chinese and Chinese American people; however, research regarding effective diabetes interventions for this minority group is sparse.
A literature review was conducted to determine a study design and interventions for future studies investigating the efficacy of a family-based intervention to improve diabetes care for Chinese Americans.
The review was conducted from January 2023 to April 2023.

Daily Functioning of Veterans With Type 2 Diabetes: Protocol for an Ambulatory Assessment Study.,"['Jennalee SWooldridge', 'Jessica LMorse', 'JorgeDelgado', 'NiloofarAfari']","Diabetes impacts nearly 25% of veterans. Many veterans do not engage in recommended physical activity and other diabetes self-management behaviors. Type 2 diabetes is generally asymptomatic; as such, the long-term consequences of inadequate self-management and benefits of consistent self-management are not salient in the short term. Furthermore, self-management behaviors typically take place outside of medical visits; however, self-management-related factors are only assessed during medical visits, likely missing large amounts of variability. Thus, ambulatory assessment methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA), accelerometry, and continuous glucose monitoring are needed to understand the dynamics of daily self-management and identify potential intervention targets.
The overarching goal of this study is to understand daily, time-varying factors (comorbid affective symptoms and social context) that influence physical activity, diabetes self-management, glycemic management, daily functioning, and quality of life in participants' natural environments.
We are recruiting veterans with type 2 diabetes (target N=100). Participants are required to complete a battery of baseline assessments related to mental health, psychosocial factors, and self-management behaviors. Participants then receive 5 momentary EMA surveys and 1 daily EMA survey per day, in which veterans report comorbid affective symptoms (mood, stress, and pain), social support, social interactions, physical activity, and other self-management behaviors. Momentary surveys are delivered randomly during daily preprogrammed intervals over a 14-day sampling period. Accelerometry and continuous glucose monitoring are also used to assess physical activity and blood glucose, respectively. The first 6 participants also completed interviews assessing their experience in the study and barriers to participation. These test participants informed modifications to the protocol for the remaining participants.
The project received funding in April of 2023. Enrollment began in March of 2023 and is planned to be completed in April 2025. Among the 6 test participants, the overall EMA response rate was 87% (range 74%-95%). The response rate for the EMA survey including daily items (67%, range 21%-93%) was lower than the earlier shorter EMA surveys (89%, range 81%-96%). The mean rate of valid accelerometer wear of at least 20 hours per day was 93% (SD 11%), and continuous glucose monitoring data were available for 91% (SD 17%) of days on average. Participants reported few barriers to completing EMA surveys but noted the random timing of questions made it difficult to plan around, and the end-of-day survey was long. Two participants reported survey items reminded or motivated them to engage in diabetes self-management behaviors.
Assessment tools developed from this study can inform clinical decision-making by considering barriers to self-management that occur in daily life. Clinical applications include tailored, adaptive technology-supported interventions to improve self-management that provide the right type and amount of support at the right time by adapting to an individual's changing internal and contextual state.

They activate NADPH oxidase (NOX) by binding to their receptors, thereby increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the effects of AGEs on the tissues of the shoulder joint (such as rotator cuff synovium, and capsule) in patients with DM having rotator cuff tears.
This study included eight patients with DM who underwent surgical treatment for rotator cuff tears with contracture. The rotator cuff, synovium, and joint capsule were harvested at the time of surgery and evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Furthermore, immunostaining was used for evaluating AGEs and receptor for AGEs (RAGE), cell activity, ROS, and apoptosis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed for the cellular evaluation of NOX, interleukins, RAGE, and collagen.
The AGEs and RAGE staining as well as the ratio of ROS and apoptosis were in the following order: rotator cuff > joint capsule > synovium. In contrast, the cellular activity was significantly higher in the synovium than in the other regions. The type I collagen expression (as shown by qPCR) as well as the RAGE and NOX expressions were as follows: rotator cuff > joint capsule > synovium. Conversely, the expression of inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-6 and IL-1β) was higher in the synovium than in the other regions.
Our study is among the first to evaluate the effects of AGEs on each tissue of the shoulder joint in patients with DM having rotator cuff tears and contractures. The accumulation of AGEs in each tissue of the shoulder joint could reveal the locations affected by DM, which can lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of DM-related shoulder diseases.",type 2 diabetics
"Exploring the burden of mixed dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A cross-sectional study in Kashmir, India.","['Suhail ShafiLone', 'SabhiyaMajid', 'Mohammad HayatBhat', 'Gulzar AhmadWani']","Diabetes-related dyslipidemia is a multifaceted, complicated disorder characterized by an abnormal lipid profile in individuals with diabetes. The incidence of different types of dyslipidemia, however, was not a focus of prior investigations. The patients were characterized into three categories of dyslipidemia. Different patterns of dyslipidemia were combined into single dyslipidemia (7 patterns), mixed dyslipidemia (16 patterns), and triple dyslipidemia (4 patterns).
In this cross-sectional study, 586 people suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were included. We assessed the serum lipid profile and used log (TG/HDL-C) to determine the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP). Dyslipidemia was examined as a categorical variable, and the findings were presented as percentages and numbers. To compare categorical variables, we either utilized Fisher exact tests or Chi square tests.
The study comprised of 586 T2DM patients, with 310 (52.9%) women and 276 (47.1%) men. Women have significantly higher hypertension (33.6%) as compared to men (23.2%). 18.94% (111) of patients were having coronary artery disease (CAD) history consisting of 12.28% (72) females and 6.66% (39) males, a difference which is statistically significant. 98.12% of total individuals had as a minimum of one lipid abnormality. 4.61% (27) of study subjects were having isolated dyslipidemia and 93.51% (548) had dual or triple pattern of dyslipidemia (mixed dyslipidemia). High AIP >0.24 (94.8%) was the most predominant trend of dyslipidemia. The dual combination of AIP (>0.24) and HDL (<50 mg/dL in Females and <40 mg/dL in Males) was found to be the most common pattern of mixed dyslipidemia (68.08%). The most prevalent trend of isolated dyslipidemia was found to be high AIP (>0.24), In patients with CAD history. Among the mixed dyslipidemia, the common pattern of dyslipidemia (71.17%) was the dual combination of high AIP (>0.24) and low HDL (<50 mg/dL women and <40 mg/dL males). The triple combination of TG (≥200 mg/dL) and HDL (<40 and <50 mg/dL) and LDL (≥100 mg/dL) was only found in females.
In conclusion, dyslipidemia is highly prevalent in T2DM patients, with mixed dyslipidemia being the most common type observed in the community of Kashmir valley, India. High AIP was the most prevalent pattern in the current investigation.",type 2 diabetics

To determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in bipolar disorder patients and its clinico-demographic and homocysteine correlates, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 195 bipolar disorder inpatients. They received questionnaires, clinical measurements and laboratory tests to assess demographic characteristics, anthropometric variables, clinical variables and plasma homocysteine levels. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (including type 1, type 2 and special types) in Chinese bipolar disorder patients was 14.9%. Analysis of variance or chi-square test showed that compared with non-diabetic bipolar disorder patients, diabetic bipolar disorder patients were older, more often married, had a longer duration of disease, took less olanzapine and had a higher frequency of hypertension. However, there were no significant differences in body mass index (BMI) and homocysteine levels between diabetic and non-diabetic bipolar disorder patients. Logistic regression analysis showed that marital status and duration of disease were independently associated with diabetes mellitus in patients with bipolar disorder after controlling for age, use of olanzapine, presence of hypertension, BMI and homocysteine levels. These findings shed light on the clinico-demographic correlates of the increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus in bipolar disorder patients, rather than the correlation with some metabolic risk factors.",type 2 diabetics

Ongoing monitoring of maternal A1C (at pregnancy confirmation and at 20, 28, and 36 weeks' gestation) remains useful. Intensification of glycemic management and instruction in using CGM (if not already used) is recommended for individuals with an A1C >6.0% after 20 weeks. A better understanding of CGM-documented glycemic changes throughout pregnancy is needed to inform future management of gestational diabetes and pregnancy in people with type 2 diabetes.

Modelling the replacement of red and processed meat with plant-based alternatives and the estimated effect on insulin sensitivity in a cohort of Australian adults.,"['James PGoode', 'Kylie JSmith', 'MoniqueBreslin', 'MichelleKilpatrick', 'TerenceDwyer', 'Alison JVenn', 'Costan GMagnussen']","Dietary guidelines are increasingly promoting mostly plant-based diets, limits on red meat consumption, and plant-based sources of protein for health and environmental reasons. It is unclear how the resulting food substitutions associate with insulin resistance, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. We modelled the replacement of red and processed meat with plant-based alternatives and the estimated effect on insulin sensitivity. We included 783 participants (55% female) from the Childhood Determinants of Adult Health study, a population-based cohort of Australians. In adulthood, diet was assessed at three time points using food frequency questionnaires: 2004-2006, 2009-2011, and 2017-2019. We calculated the average daily intake of each food group in standard serves. Insulin sensitivity was estimated from fasting glucose and insulin concentrations in 2017-2019 (aged 39-49 years) using homeostasis model assessment. Replacing red meat with a combination of plant-based alternatives was associated with higher insulin sensitivity (",type 2 diabetics
[Holistic Person-Centered Care for Individuals With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus].,"['Hui-ChunHsu', 'Yau-JiunnLee', 'Ruey-HsiaWang']","In 2022, the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes emphasized that type 2 diabetes care is a person-centered holistic care concept. This article summarizes the concepts of holistic care for individuals with type 2 diabetes and proposes a complete model of the six-layer whole-person care circle for individuals with type 2 diabetes. This model treats individuals with type 2 diabetes as the core of care and adopts their specific needs, preferences, and values to design individualized care plans. The overall goal of care is to maintain quality of life and to avoid or delay complications. Management methods must be holistic. Based on people and comprehensive considerations, six circles of care are listed. The first layer is caregivers, taking into account the influence of the family and the community on the individual. The second layer is multi-professional and multi-disciplinary team care, which provides support to individuals with diabetes. The third layer emphasizes the need for the following thirteen principles in diabetes care: monitoring and screening for complications, behavior modification for healthy habits, monitoring and continuous assessment, reducing the risk of hypoglycemia, effective implementation and care organization, considering underlying physiological conditions, avoiding therapeutic inertia, considering social determinants of health, psychological factors, structured diabetes education, language proficiency, shared decision-making, and considering regional healthcare institutions and related resources. The fourth layer is the decision cycle of care, which applies the principles of care and conducts continuous and dynamic case management based on the decision cycle. The fifth layer is the healthcare network through which health providers provide hospital, long-term care, and primary clinics/ primary network care referrals based on the needs of individual with diabetes. The sixth layer leverages the chronic care model to construct a supportive healthcare system comprising organizational support, clinical information systems, delivery system design, decision support, self-management support, and community resources. This proposed model may provide a reference for constructing healthcare systems to care for patients with type 2 diabetes.
以人為中心第二型糖尿病個案六層全人照護圈.
2022年美國糖尿病學會（American Diabetes Association）及歐洲糖尿病研究學會（European Association for the Study of Diabetes）強調第二型糖尿病照護是以人為中心（person centered）之全人照護概念，本文綜合整理第二型糖尿病照護相關文獻，提出「第二型糖尿病個人六層全人照護圈」的模式。此模式將第二型糖尿病個人處於照護核心，除考量到其需求、偏好及價值觀，並以六層照護圈為基礎，以達到優化個案生活品質並避免及延緩併發症產生的總體照顧目標。第一層強調照護提供者須列入家庭與社區。第二層為在照護團隊須為多專業、跨科別的醫療團隊照護，透過資訊平台溝通形成在個案照護過程中的後盾。第三層強調在照護上仍須透過合併症的監控及篩檢、健康行為修正、監測及持續評估、減少低血糖風險、有效的實踐及照護組織、考量潛在的生理狀況、避免治療惰性、考量健康的社會決定因素、心理因素、糖尿病結構化的教育、語言方式、共享決策及考量區域內醫療機構及相關資源等十三項原則的運用。第四層則強調運用照護決策循環原則，持續性、動態性的進行個案管理。第五層強調照護網絡的整合，根據個人終生的健康需求適當轉介醫院、長期照護或基層診所／醫療群，以達到良好的照護。第六層則強調健康照護系統的建置須基於慢性病照護模式中的社區資源及政策、健康照護系統組織、自我管理支持、設計傳輸系統、臨床資訊系統以及決策資源的有效性整合，以建立支持性的健康照護系統，達到以人為中心的預防併發症及優化生活品質的核心目標。希望此模式可做為台灣地區未來在規畫第二型糖尿病健康照護體系的參考。.",type 2 diabetics
"[Effects of a Motivational Interview Intervention on Self-Efficacy, Self-Care Behavior, and Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetic Patients].","['Hung-YenWu', 'Shu-MingChen', 'Pei-LingWang']","Motivation is an important factor in disease management for diabetic patients. However, motivational strengthening interventions have been inadequately effective in effecting behavior change in this group.
This study was designed to investigate the effect of a motivational interview intervention on self-efficacy, self-care behavior, and blood sugar control in patients with type 2 diabetes.
The target population comprised patients with type 2 diabetes in two medical wards of a regional hospital in the southern Taiwan. The 112 participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 56) and control group (n = 56). Over a three month period, the experimental group received 6 motivational interview sessions of 50 minutes each in addition to usual diabetes care, while the control group received usual diabetes care on the ward. Both groups completed the demographic questionnaire, Chinese version of Diabetes Self-Efficacy Scale, Diabetes Self-Care Behavior Scale, glycosylated hemoglobin level pre-test, and 3 months post-test survey. The results were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 for Windows.
A total of 55 patients in the experimental group and 52 patients in the control group completed the study. After analysis, significant inter-group differences in self-efficacy and self-care behavior were found between the experimental group and the control group at pre-test and three-month post-test (p < .001). For the experimental group, the three-month post-test score and glycated hemoglobin value were higher than at pre-test. The three-month post-test value was significantly lower (p < .001) than the pre-test value, and the change effect in the experimental group was better than that in the control group. There was a significant difference in the stages of change between pre-test and post-test (χ2 = 43.89, p < .001), and the change effect in the experimental group was better than that in the control group.
The proposed motivational interview intervention can help patients with type 2 diabetes admitted to medical wards improve their self-efficacy, self-care behavior, and glycated hemoglobin values. In the future, nursing education should improve the teaching of motivational interview skills to allow nurses to conduct effective interviews quickly during treatment, increase their patients' motivation to self-control blood sugar, and enable patients to learn blood sugar control skills before discharge to achieve effective blood sugar control.
動機式晤談介入於第二型糖尿病病人自我效能、自我照顧行為及血糖控制之成效.
動機對糖尿病病人疾病管理是重要的因素，但有效的動機強化介入對病人的行為改變是一大挑戰。.
本研究旨在探討動機式晤談介入對第二型糖尿病病人自我效能、自我照顧行為及血糖控制之成效。.
採實驗性研究設計，隨機分派方式選取南區某區域醫院兩個綜合內科病房的第二型糖尿病病人共112人，以隨機分派到實驗組（n = 56）及對照組（n = 56）。實驗組接受一般性糖尿病照護外加上6次動機式晤談，每次50分鐘，為期三個月。對照組接受病房一般性糖尿病照護。研究工具包括：基本人口學調查表、中文版糖尿病自我效能量表、糖尿病自我照顧行為量表、糖化血色素值等於介入前及滿3個月後資料收集，使用微軟 SPSS 22.0分析統計資料。.
實驗組共55位、對照組共52位完成研究。動機式晤談介入6次後，實驗組與對照組前、三個月後測分數，經分析在自我效能、自我照顧行為達顯著差異（p < .001），實驗組三個月後測分數大於前測、糖化血色素前後測數值達顯著差異（p < .001），三個月後測數值低於前測。且改變成效實驗組優於對照組。在行動改變周期方面介入前及滿3個月後測的成效達顯著差異（χ2 = 43.89, p < .001），且改變成效實驗組優於對照組。.
動機式晤談介入6次有助於第二型糖尿病病人於自我效能、自我照顧行為及糖化血色素的控制成效，未來建議增加院內護理關於會談技巧之相關課程，以便護理人員於做治療時，可以利用簡短的時間，進行有效的晤談，增加病人控制血糖之動機，使病人於出院前學習血糖控制技巧，以達到血糖控制之目的。.",type 2 diabetics
Counting the Minutes: Perceived Diabetes Mental Load and its Associations With Technology Use and Mental Disorders.,"['Lilli-SophiePriesterroth', 'NorbertHermanns', 'BernhardKulzer', 'ThomasHaak', 'DominicEhrmann']","Little is known about mental load in people with diabetes and associations with demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics, such as the use of diabetes technologies. To explore perceived mental load, 503 adults with diabetes answered the one-item survey ""How much time (in minutes) would you spontaneously estimate that you spend each day thinking about your diabetes?"" Mental load estimations varied widely within the sample and between subgroups. Perceived mental load was higher in type 1 diabetes than in type 2 diabetes, higher in women than in men and increased with treatment intensity (ie, insulin therapy, technology use) and the number of mental disorders. Further research may explore associations with diabetes-related distress and determine whether (perceived) mental load has relevance in technology use.",type 2 diabetics
Comprehensive Diabetes Assessment Instrument for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.,"['JodiSegal', 'RobertDeGrazia', 'SamanthaPitts', 'KristalBrown', 'MaileTaualii']","There is a paucity of efficient processes for collecting information in a primary care setting to connect patients afflicted with type 2 diabetes to valuable resources. The objective of this research project was to develop a Comprehensive Diabetes Assessment (CDA) instrument which could be used to assess patients' barriers to best outcomes.
We reviewed published literature and online compilations for validated tools assessing threats to optimal diabetes self-management. We conducted focus groups with patients, clinicians, and service providers who provided feedback on the tools' appropriateness and feasibility. We aggregated the favored tools and did cognitive testing with patients to assess understanding and affective response to the instrument.
Five focus groups involved varied stakeholders in Baltimore, MD and Honolulu, HI. We presented 2 tools assessing knowledge barriers, 3 tools assessing psychological barriers, 4 tools assessing literacy, and 1 numeracy. The final instrument included 6 multi-part items and takes 3 minutes to complete. Cognitive interviewing with 8 patients in Baltimore and 8 in Hawaii confirmed that the instrument is understandable, quick to complete, and is acceptable to patients.
Because of the complexity of self-management of diabetes, we suggest that this CDA instrument, plus a social needs assessment, should be administered at least annually and at times of clinical deterioration. We anticipate the instrument will be proven valuable in connecting patients to services from which they will benefit.",type 2 diabetics
Psychiatric comorbidities in women with cardiometabolic conditions with and without ADHD: a population-based study.,"['Unnur JakobsdottirSmari', 'Unnur AnnaValdimarsdottir', 'ThorAspelund', 'ArnaHauksdottir', 'Edda BjorkThordardottir', 'Catharina AHartman', 'PontusAndell', 'HenrikLarsson', 'HelgaZoega']","Leveraging a large nationwide study of Icelandic women, we aimed to narrow the evidence gap around female attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and cardiometabolic comorbidities by determining the prevalence of obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases among women with ADHD and examine the association between cardiometabolic conditions and co-occurring ADHD with anxiety and mood disorders, alcoholism/substance use disorder (SUD), self-harm, and suicide attempts.
We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the nationwide, all-female, population-based SAGA Cohort Study (n = 26,668). To ascertain diagnoses and symptoms, we used self-reported history of ADHD diagnoses, selected cardiometabolic conditions and psychiatric disorders, and measured current depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms through appropriate questionnaires (PHQ-9, GAD-7, and PCL-5). We calculated age-adjusted prevalences of cardiometabolic conditions by women's ADHD status and estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), using modified Poisson regression models. Similarly, we assessed the association of cardiometabolic conditions and co-occurring ADHD with current psychiatric symptoms and psychiatric disorders, using adjusted PRs and 95% CIs.
We identified 2299 (8.6%) women with a history of ADHD diagnosis. The age-adjusted prevalence of having at least one cardiometabolic condition was higher among women with ADHD (49.5%) than those without (41.7%), (PR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.14-1.25), with higher prevalence of all measured cardiometabolic conditions (myocardial infarctions (PR = 2.53, 95% CI 1.83--3.49), type 2 diabetes (PR = 2.08, 95% CI 1.66-2.61), hypertension (PR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.12-1.34), and obesity (PR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.11-1.25)). Women with cardiometabolic conditions and co-occurring ADHD had, compared with those without ADHD, substantially increased prevalence of (a) all measured mood and anxiety disorders, e.g., depression (PR = 2.38, 95% CI 2.19-2.58), bipolar disorder (PR = 4.81, 95% CI 3.65-6.35), posttraumatic stress disorder (PR = 2.78, 95% CI 2.52-3.07), social phobia (PR = 2.96, 95% CI 2.64-3.32); (b) moderate/severe depressive, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms with PR = 1.76 (95% CI 1.67-1.85), PR = 1.97 (95% CI 1.82-2.12), and PR = 2.01 (95% CI 1.88-2.15), respectively; (c) alcoholism/SUD, PR = 4.79 (95% CI 3.90-5.89); and (d) self-harm, PR = 1.47 (95% CI 1.29-1.67) and suicide attempts, PR = 2.37 (95% CI 2.05-2.73).
ADHD is overrepresented among women with cardiometabolic conditions and contributes substantially to other psychiatric comorbidities among women with cardiometabolic conditions.",type 2 diabetics

This study is a secondary data analysis. Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, we describe the changes in CKD-T2D burden and its influencing factors in the population aged 20-59 years from 1990 to 2019. Globally, the incidence, death, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) rate of CKD-T2D showed an upward trend and increased with age, and the burden in males was higher than that in females. Population growth and aging were important driving factors for the increase of CKD-T2D DALY burden, while high systolic blood pressure and high body-mass index were the primary attributable risk factors. High body-mass index exhibited higher contributions to high Socioeconomic Development Index (SDI) countries, whereas low SDI countries were more impacted by high systolic blood pressure. The population attributable fraction of CKD-T2D DALY caused by high body-mass index was positively correlated with SDI, while high temperature and lead exposure were negatively correlated. Therefore, strengthening disease screening for people aged 20-59 years and formulating early intervention measures based on the level of socioeconomic development may effectively alleviate the burden of CKD-T2D.",type 2 diabetics

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and multiple-dose escalation clinical trial aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamical characteristics as well as the safety and tolerability of SY-009 in T2DM patients.
Fifty T2DM patients were randomized into experimental and placebo groups, and hospitalized for 9 days managed with a unified diet and rest management. Subjects were given SY-009 or placebo from day 1 to day 7 at different frequencies and dosages. Single dose cohort was defined as the first dose on day 1 and multiple dose cohort included all the dose from day 1 to 7. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Mixed meal tolerance tests were performed. Blood samples were collected to determine glucose, C-peptide, insulin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP).
PK parameters were not obtained because blood SY-009 concentrations were below the limit of quantitation in all subjects. SY-009 decreased the postprandial glucose. Blood glucose was controlled within 4 hours after taking the drug. Short-term administration of SY-009 (7 days) had no significant effects on fasting glucose but reduced the secretion of C-peptide, insulin, and GIP and increased GLP-1 secretion. The most common adverse event was gastrointestinal disorder manifesting abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloating.
Plasma exposure of SY-009 and its metabolites was fairly low in T2DM patients at doses of 1.0-4.0 mg. SY-009 reduced postprandial glucose, C-peptide, and insulin levels, showing relative safety and tolerability in the dose range of 1.0-4.0 mg.

The association between dapagliflozin use and the risk of post contrast acute kidney injury in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a propensity-matched analysis.,"['TaoLiu', 'XinwenJian', 'LiLi', 'ShanChu', 'ZeyuanFan']","Introduction This study aimed to investigate the effect of dapagliflozin in preventing post contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who underwent an elective coronary procedure. Methods Data of patients with T2DM and CKD undergoing an elective coronary procedure at Civil Aviation General Hospital from October 2020 to April 2023, were collected from the electronic medical records. Based on dapagliflozin usage, patients were classified as dapagliflozin users and non-users. 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity matching was performed to compare dapagliflozin users with non-users. The primary endpoint was the first PC-AKI observed. Univariate and multivariate COX regression models were used to determine the independent risk/preventive factors for PC-AKI. Thereafter, subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the interaction between subgroup and dapagliflozin usage. Changes in the serum creatinine (SCr) and cystatin C (CysC) levels were monitored at 24h, 48h and 72h after the procedure. Results 256 pairs (256 dapagliflozin users in the dapagliflozin group and 256 dapagliflozin non-users in the control group) were identified in the cohort. The incidence of PC-AKI in dapagliflozin group (10.9%) was lower than that in control group (22.3%). COX regression analyses showed that dapagliflozin use was associated with a lower risk of PC-AKI (HR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.95, P=0.01) after adjustment for covariates. In the subgroup analyses, similar HRs of the dapagliflozin usage on the PC-AKI outcome were observed in patients across different patients' characteristics which revealed its consistent benefit of preventing PC-AKI. The eGFR levels at post-48h and 72h were significant higher in the dapagliflozin group than those in the control group, while levels of SCr (post-48h and 72h) and CysC (post-24h and 48h) in the dapagliflozin group were lower compared with the control group. Conclusion Our findings suggest dapagliflozin effectively decrease PC-AKI risk and exert reno-protective effects in patients with T2DM and CKD undergoing an elective coronary procedure.",type 2 diabetics
Colonic L-cell impairment in aged subjects with type 2 diabetes leads to diminished GLP-1 production.,"['Qing-YuWang', 'WeiZhang', 'YueZhao', 'Hui-LianChen', 'QianLiu', 'Zi-HuiWang', 'Lv-TaoZeng', 'JinLi', 'Si-JieChen', 'LeiWei', 'TomooIwakuma', 'Jian-PingCai']","Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is produced by the L subtype of enteroendocrine cells (EECs). Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) exhibit reduced incretin effect, but the pathophysiology and functional change of the L-cells remain unclear. Deciphering the mechanisms of the biological changes in L-cells under T2D conditions may assist in the research of gut-based strategies for T2D therapy.
We investigated the fasting serum GLP-1 levels and the distribution of colonic L-cells in young and aged participants with and without T2D. Additionally, we established an aged male T2D Wistar rat model subjected to a long-term high-fat and high-fructose (HFHF) diet. Histological investigations and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses were performed to explore the mechanisms underlying functional changes in the colonic EECs.
We observed a decline in circulating GLP-1 levels and a reduced number of colonic L-cells in elderly patients with T2D. The mechanisms underlying impaired L-cell formation and disturbed GLP-1 production were revealed using aged T2D rats induced by a long-term HFHF diet. The scRNA-seq results showed that the transcription factors that regulate L-cell commitment, such as Foxa1, were downregulated, and the expression of genes that participate in encoding GLP-1, GLP-1 posttranslational processing, hormone secretion, and nutrient sensing was disturbed.
Taken together, the reduced L-cell lineage commitment and disturbed L-cell functions might be the major cause of the reduced GLP-1 production in aged populations with T2D. Our study provides new insights for identifying novel targets in colonic L-cells for improving endogenous GLP-1 production.",type 2 diabetics

The enrolled patients were randomly selected for training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. The models for predicting risk of DKD were virtualized by the nomograms using logistic regression analysis.
Among the enrolled 597 patients, 418 were assigned to the training set, while 179 were assigned to the validation set. Using the predictors included glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), presence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and duration of diabetes (DD), we constructed a full model (model 1) for predicting DKD. And using the laboratory indexes of HbA1c, HDL-C, and cystatin C (Cys-C), we developed a laboratory-based model (model 2). The C-indexes were 0.897 for model 1 and 0.867 for model 2, respectively. The calibration curves demonstrated a good agreement between prediction and observation in the two models. The decision curve analysis (DCA) curves showed that the two models achieved a net benefit across all threshold probabilities.
We successfully constructed two prediction models to evaluate the risk of DKD in patients with T2DM. The two models exhibited good predictive performance and could be recommended for DKD screening and early detection.",type 2 diabetics

Amino acids are considered to be a major component of dietary sources for many of the associations between dietary protein and chronic disease. Therefore, this study amied to determine the association between dietary amino acid intakes and the incidence of T2D.
The present nested case-control study was conducted using data from the Ravansar Non-Communicable Disease (RaNCD) Cohort Study. The information required for this study was collected from individuals who participated in the Adult Cohort Study from the start of the study until September 2023. Over a 6-year follow-up period, data from 113 new T2D cases were available. Four controls were then randomly selected for each case using density sampling. Cases and controls were matched for sex and age at the interview. Food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to collect data related to all amino acids including tryptophan, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, cysteine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, valine, arginine, histidine, alanine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, proline, and serine were also extracted. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratio for the risk of T2D.
Using the univariable model, a significant association was found between T2D risk and branched-chain, alkaline, sulfuric, and essential amino acids in the fourth quartile. Accordingly, individuals in the fourth quartile had a 1.81- to 1.87-fold higher risk of developing new T2D than individuals in the lowest quartile (P<0.05). After adjustment for several variables, the risk of developing a new T2D was 2.70 (95% CI: 1.16-6.31), 2.68 (95% CI: 1.16-6.21), 2.98 (95% CI: 1.27-6.96), 2.45 (95% CI: 1.02-5.90), and 2.66 (95% CI: 1.13-6.25) times higher, for individuals in the fourth quartile of branched-chain, alkaline, sulfuric, alcoholic, and essential amino acids compared with those in the lowest quartile, respectively.
The results showed that the risk of developing a new T2D was higher for individuals in the fourth quartile of branched-chain amino acids, alkaline, sulfate, and essential amino acids than in the lower quartile.",type 2 diabetics
A Mechanism of Action of Metformin in the Brain: Prevention of Methylglyoxal-Induced Glutamatergic Impairment in Acute Hippocampal Slices.,"['Adriana Fernanda KVizuete', 'FernandaFróes', 'MarinaSeady', 'FernandaHansen', 'RodrigoLigabue-Braun', 'Carlos-AlbertoGonçalves', 'Diogo OSouza']","Metformin, a biguanide compound (N-1,1-dimethylbiguanide), is widely prescribed for diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2D) treatment. It also presents a plethora of properties, such as anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptosis, anti-tumorigenic, and anti-AGE formation activity. However, the precise mechanism of action of metformin in the central nervous system (CNS) needs to be clarified. Herein, we investigated the neuroprotective role of metformin in acute hippocampal slices exposed to methylglyoxal (MG), a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound and a key molecule in T2D developmental pathophysiology. Metformin protected acute hippocampal slices from MG-induced glutamatergic neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation by reducing IL-1β synthesis and secretion and RAGE protein expression. The drug also improved astrocyte function, particularly with regard to the glutamatergic system, increasing glutamate uptake. Moreover, we observed a direct effect of metformin on glutamate transporters, where the compound prevented glycation, by facilitating enzymatic phosphorylation close to Lys residues, suggesting a new neuroprotective role of metformin via PKC ζ in preventing dysfunction in glutamatergic system induced by MG. Proposed neuroprotection role of metformin in acute hippocampal slices against impairment in glutamatergic system induced in a model of methylglyoxal glycotoxicity. Metformin reversed methylglyoxal (MG)-induced neuroinflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory IL-1β synthesis and secretion and RAGE protein expression. Metformin did not alter the effect of MG on S100B secretion (1). Both MG and metformin also influenced astrocyte function in hippocampal slices. Metformin did not reverse the elevation in GLO1 activity induced by glycotoxicity; however, it abrogated the high GSH level and the expression of the co-factor of GLO1 (2). Both treatments per se changed bioenergetic metabolism and increased glucose uptake, extracellular lactate content, and pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. The increment in glucose uptake and lactate levels ceased during the co-incubation of MG with metformin. Metformin reversed the elevation of hexokinase activity by MG (3). We suggest a new role of metformin in the glutamate system, whereby it protects the hippocampus against the derangements of the glutamatergic system induced by MG, possibly by phosphorylation via PKC ζ (4). The neuroprotective action of metformin may be mediated by the phosphorylation of specific amino acid residues (Lysine) of the glutamate transporters (GLAST and GLT-1), since metformin activated the PKC ζ signaling and promoted cascades of phosphorylation in p38 MAPK and Akt proteins. The transporter protein phosphorylation prevented the Lys-glycation and the impairment of glutamate uptake induced by MG (5).",type 2 diabetics
Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Associations of Comorbidities with Knee Symptoms and Radiographic Abnormalities of Osteoarthritis.,"['XiaoxiLi', 'FengPan', 'RuiZhu', 'LiruGe', 'XiaoyueZhang', 'XiangruiWen', 'JiantaoZhou', 'JialeCheng', 'FamingPan', 'GuoqiCai']","This study aimed to investigate the associations of comorbidities with knee symptoms and radiographic abnormalities of osteoarthritis (OA).
Participants were from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Comorbidities were identified at baseline using the modified Charlson Comorbidity Index. For both knees, symptoms were assessed annually from baseline to 48 months using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain and function scores (rescaled range 0-100), and radiographic abnormalities using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL, 0-4) grades. The presence of significant pain and functional disability was defined as a WOMAC score of ≥ 25 and ≥ 22, respectively, and radiographic OA (ROA) as KL ≥ 2. An increase of ≥ 9 in WOMAC scores and ≥ 1 in KL grades were defined as symptomatic and radiographic progression, respectively.
Of 3337 participants, 28% and 9% had one and ≥ 2 comorbidities, respectively. The number of comorbidities was associated with the presence of significant functional disability (odds ratios [ORs] 1.15; 1.46) and predicted the progression of both knee pain and functional disability (ORs 1.11; 1.51). For the type of comorbidities, non-OA musculoskeletal diseases were associated with the presence of ROA and significant functional disability (ORs 1.63; 1.82) and showed a trend to predict incident ROA (OR 1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.00-3.38 p = 0.051). Diabetes and kidney diseases were associated with symptomatic progression of OA (ORs 1.38; 2.72).
Having more comorbidities, especially diabetes and kidney diseases, is associated with symptomatic progression of knee OA. Moreover, non-OA musculoskeletal diseases may be associated with the presence and onset of ROA.",type 2 diabetics
"Correlations between insulin-degrading enzyme and metabolic markers in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and healthy controls: a comparative study.","['HelenaKullenberg', 'JennyRossen', 'Unn-BrittJohansson', 'MariaHagströmer', 'ThomasNyström', 'MariaKumlin', 'Marie MSvedberg']","This study aimed to explore correlations between insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and markers of metabolic function in a group of patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and metabolically healthy volunteers.
We included 120 individuals (47 with T2DM, 9 with AD, and 64 healthy controls). Serum levels of IDE were measured with commercial kits for ELISA. Differences in IDE levels between groups were analyzed with non-parametric ANCOVA, and correlations were analyzed with Spearman's rank correlations. We also investigated the influence of age, sex, and the use of insulin on the correlation using a non-parametric version of partial correlation.
Patients diagnosed with T2DM had higher IDE levels than patients diagnosed with AD and healthy controls after adjustment for age and sex. IDE was increasingly associated with body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose, C-peptide, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin resistance, and triglycerides. In stratified analyses, we found a decreasing partial correlation between IDE and HbA1c in patients diagnosed with AD and a decreasing partial correlation between IDE and C-peptide in healthy controls. In patients diagnosed with T2DM, we found no partial correlations.
These results indicate that IDE is essential in metabolic function and might reflect metabolic status, although it is not yet a biomarker that can be utilized in clinical practice. Further research on IDE in human blood may provide crucial insights into the full function of the enzyme.",type 2 diabetics
Cardiovascular prevention in diabetes mellitus. Is it appropriate to speak of moderate or intermediate risk?,"['SergioMartínez-Hervás', 'José TReal', 'RafaelCarmena', 'Juan FAscaso']","Diabetes, especially type 2, is considered a risk situation for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Subjects with diabetes type 2 have a mortality rate due to ASCVD 3 times higher than that found in the general population, attributed to hyperglycemia and the frequent association of other cardiovascular risk factors, such as atherogenic dyslipidemia. Numerous scientific societies have established a risk classification for ASCVD in diabetes based on 3 degrees (moderate, high and very high). The objectives of dyslipidemia control are clearly defined and accepted, and vary depending on the previously established cardiovascular risk. In moderate or intermediate risk, the guidelines propose a less intensive intervention, maintaining LDL-C levels<100mg/dL and NO-HDL-C levels<130mg/dL, and waiting 10 years until reaching the high-risk category to initiate more intensive treatment. However, during the decade of follow-up recommended in the guidelines, cholesterol deposition in the arterial wall increases, facilitating the development of an unstable and inflammatory atheromatous plaque, and the development of ASCVD. Alternatively, diabetes could be considered from the outset to be a high-risk situation and the goal should be LDL-C<70mg/dL. Furthermore, maintaining LDL-C levels<70mg/dL contributes to reducing and stabilizing atheromatous plaque, avoiding or reducing mortality episodes due to ASCVD during those years of diabetes evolution. Should we maintain the proposed objectives in subjects with diabetes and moderate risk for a decade until reaching the high cardiovascular risk phase or, on the contrary, should we adopt a more intensive stance from the beginning seeking to reduce cardiovascular risk in the majority of patients with diabetes? Is it better to wait or prevent with effective therapeutic measures from the first moment?",type 2 diabetics
Novel GLP-1(28-36) amide-derived hybrid peptide A3 with weight loss and hypoglycemic activities.,"['ChenWang', 'BinbinGong', 'QianqianZhu', 'JingHan', 'LidanSun']","Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has gained much attention in the last decade for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

The hypoglycemic and weight-reducing effects of the reported metabolites and modifications still need to be confirmed. In this study, we started from the C-terminal nonapeptide GLP-1(28-36) amide and developed a series of GLP-1(28-36) amide-derived hybrid peptides.

"No effect of remoteness on clinical outcomes following myocardial infarction: An analysis of 43,729 myocardial infarctions in Victoria, Australia.","['Adam CLivori', 'ZanfinaAdemi', 'JenniIlomäki', 'DerkPol', 'Jedidiah IMorton', 'J SimonBell']","Remoteness has been shown to predict poor clinical outcomes following myocardial infarction (MI). This study investigated 1-year clinical outcomes following MI by remoteness in Victoria, Australia.
We included all admissions for people discharged from hospital following MI between July 2012 and June 2017 (n = 43,729). Remoteness was determined using the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA). The relationship between remoteness and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality over 1-year was evaluated using adjusted Poisson regression, stratified by type STEMI and NSTEMI.
For NSTEMI, adjusted rates of MACE were 77.5[95% confidence interval 65.1-92.1] for the most remote area versus 83.4[65.5-106.3] for the least remote area per 1000 person-years. For STEMI, rates of MACE were 28.5[18.3-44.6] for the most versus 33.5[18.9-59.4] for the least remote areas per 1000 person-years. With respect to all-cause mortality, NSTEMI mortality rates were 82.2[67.0-100.9] for the most versus 100.8[75.2-135.1] for the least remote areas per 1000 person-years. For STEMI, mortality rates were 24.7[13.7-44.7] for the most versus 22.3[9.8-50.8] for the least remote per 1000 person-years.
Rates of MACE and all-cause mortality were similar in regardless of degree of remoteness, suggesting that initiatives to increase access to cardiology care in more remote areas succeeded in reducing previous disparities.",type 2 diabetics
Insulin resistance and metabolic flexibility as drivers of liver and cardiac disease in T2DM.,"['SantoColosimo', 'Sandip KumarMitra', 'TirthankarChaudhury', 'GiulioMarchesini']","Metabolic flexibility refers to the ability of tissues to adapt their use of energy sources according to substrate availability and energy demands. This review aims to disentangle the emerging mechanisms through which altered metabolic flexibility and insulin resistance promote NAFLD and heart disease progression. Insulin resistance and metabolic inflexibility are central drivers of hepatic and cardiac diseases in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Both play a critical role in the complex interaction between glucose and lipid metabolism. Disruption of metabolic flexibility results in hyperglycemia and abnormal lipid metabolism, leading to increased accumulation of fat in the liver, contributing to the development and progression of NAFLD. Similarly, insulin resistance affects cardiac glucose metabolism, leading to altered utilization of energy substrates and impaired cardiac function, and influence cardiac lipid metabolism, further exacerbating the progression of heart failure. Regular physical activity promotes metabolic flexibility by increasing energy expenditure and enabling efficient switching between different energy substrates. On the contrary, weight loss achieved through calorie restriction ameliorates insulin sensitivity without improving flexibility. Strategies that mimic the effects of physical exercise, such as pharmacological interventions or targeted lifestyle modifications, show promise in effectively treating both diabetes and NAFLD, finally reducing the risk of advanced liver disease.",type 2 diabetics

Glyburide-treated human monocyte-derived dendritic cells loaded with insulin represent tolerogenic features with anti-inflammatory responses and modulate autologous T cell responses in vitro.,"['ShivaAlipour', 'TohidKazemi', 'Mohammad RezaSadeghi', 'Javad AhmadianHeris', 'JavadMasoumi', 'BaharNaseri', 'ElhamBaghbani', 'SepidehSohrabi', 'BehzadBaradaran']","Tolerogenic dendritic cells (TolDCs) are attractive therapeutic options for autoimmune disorders because they suppress autologous T-cell responses. Dendritic cells (DCs) are equipped with pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) such as NLRP3. Abnormal NLRP3 activation has been reported to be correlated with the occurrence of autoimmune disorders. Accordingly, we hypothesized that glyburide treatment of DCs by blocking the ATP-sensitive K+ (kATP) channels generates TolDCs by inhibiting NLRP3. Insulin was even loaded on a group of glyburide-treated mature DCs (mDCs) to investigate the antigen (Ag) loading effects on glyburide-treated mDCs' phenotypical and functional features. Consequently, T lymphocytes' mediated responses ensuing co-culture of them with control mDCs, insulin loaded and unloaded glyburide treated mDCs were evaluated to determine generated TolDCs' capacity in inhibition of T cell responses that are inducer of destruction in insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Our findings indicated that glyburide generates desirable TolDCs with decreased surface expression of maturation and Ag presentation related markers and diminished level of inflammatory but increased level of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which even insulin loading demonstrated more anti-inflammatory functions. In addition, co-cultured T cells showed regulatory or T helper 2 phenotype instead of T helper 1 features. Our findings suggested that insulin-loaded and unloaded glyburide-treated DCs are promising therapeutic approaches for autoimmune patients, specifically DCs loaded with insulin for T1DM patients.

How coronal malalignment affects the surgical outcome in corrective spine surgery for adult symptomatic lumbar deformity.,"['ToshiyukiShimizu', 'MitsuruYagi', 'SatoshiSuzuki', 'YoheiTakahashi', 'MasahiroOzaki', 'OsahikoTsuji', 'NarihitoNagoshi', 'YoshiyukiYato', 'MorioMatsumoto', 'MasayaNakamura', 'KotaWatanabe', 'NoneNone']","The importance of coronal alignment is unclear, while the importance of sagittal alignment in the treatment of adult patients with spinal deformities is well described. This study sought to elucidate the impact of global coronal malalignment (GCMA) in surgically treated adult symptomatic lumbar deformity (ASLD) patients.
A multicentre retrospective analysis of a prospective ASD database. GCMA was defined as GCA (C7PL-CSVL) ≥ 3 cm. GCMA is categorized based on the Obeid-Coronal Malalignment Classification (O-CM). Demographic, surgical, radiographic, HRQOL, and complication data were analysed. The risk for postoperative GCMA was analysed by univariate and multivariate analyses.
Of 230 surgically treated ASLD patients, 96 patients showed GCMA preoperatively and baseline GCA was correlated with the baseline SRS-22 pain domain score (r = - 30). Postoperatively, 62 patients (27%, O-CM type 1: 41[18%], type 2: 21[9%]) developed GCMA. The multivariate risk analysis indicated dementia (OR 20.1[1.2-304.4]), diabetes (OR 5.9[1.3-27.3]), and baseline O-CM type 2 (OR 2.1[1.3-3.4]) as independent risk factors for postoperative GCMA. The 2-year SRS-22 score was not different between the 2 groups, while 4 GCMA patients required revision surgery within 1 year after surgery due to coronal decompensation (GCMA+ vs. GCMA- function: 3.6 ± 0.6 vs. 3.7 ± 0.7, pain: 3.7 ± 0.8 vs. 3.8 ± 0.8, self-image: 3.6 ± 0.8 vs. 3.6 ± 0.8, mental health: 3.7 ± 0.8 vs. 3.8 ± 0.9, satisfaction: 3.9 ± 0.9 vs. 3.9 ± 0.8, total: 3.7 ± 0.7 vs. 3.7 ± 0.7). Additionally, the comparisons of 2-yr SRS-22 between GCMA ± showed no difference in any UIV and LIV level or O-CM type.
In ASLD patients with corrective spine surgery, GCMA at 2 years did not affect HRQOL or major complications at any spinal fusion extent or O-CM type of malalignment, whereas GCA correlated with pain intensity before surgery. These findings may warrant further study of the impact of GCMA on HRQOL in the surgical treatment of ASLD patients.",type 2 diabetics
Physician Perceptions of Dose Escalation for Type 2 Diabetes Medications in the United States.,"['Kristina SBoye', 'Jessica BJordan', 'RaleighMalik', 'Louis SMatza']","Medications used to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) often require dose escalation to optimize effectiveness. Physician and patient perceptions of treatment characteristics of T2D medications have previously been examined, but little is known about perceptions of escalation to the optimal dose for each patient. This study examined physicians' perceptions of dose escalation for medications used to treat T2D.
Data on dose escalation and other factors influencing decision-making for treatment of T2D were collected via an online survey of endocrinologists and primary care physicians in the USA.
The sample included 501 physicians (348 primary care physicians and 153 endocrinologists). Dose escalation was not frequently considered by physicians as a primary factor keeping patients' from reaching treatment goals (mentioned as a factor by only 7.6% of the sample) or a barrier to prescribing T2D medication (16.2%). Factors more likely to keep patients from reaching treatment goals included an unhealthy diet (86.6%) and medication adherence (77.4%). The most common reasons that physicians reported for escalating dose levels were the need for better glycemic control (reported by 89.8% of the sample), ability to decrease the total number of medications by increasing the dose of one medication (39.9%), and the need for the patient to lose weight (39.3%). Data reported by primary care physicians and endocrinologists followed similar patterns.
Although common with T2D treatments, escalating the dose of T2D medication was not perceived by physicians to be a significant barrier to attaining treatment goals or prescribing medication. Multiple factors contribute to the decision to escalate the dose of T2D medication.
In early phases of initiating medication treatment for a patient with type 2 diabetes (T2D), it is common for physicians to increase from a lower initial dose to a higher end dose to maximize treatment benefit. This process is known as dose escalation. The purpose of this study was to examine physicians’ perceptions of dose escalation for medications used to treat T2D. An online survey was designed to identify reasons why physicians in the US may choose to escalate or not escalate a dose of medication for T2D. In addition, physicians were asked about factors that keep patients from reaching treatment goals to identify whether the requirement for dose escalation is perceived to be a common barrier to successful treatment. The sample included 501 physicians (348 primary care, 153 endocrinologists). Dose escalation was not frequently considered to be a primary factor keeping patients’ from reaching treatment goals or a barrier to prescribing medication for T2D. Dose escalation decisions are complex, driven by a range of factors such as glycemic control medication tolerability, the patient’s body mass index, treatment guidelines, comorbidities, characteristics of the patient’s entire treatment regimen, and potential cardiovascular benefits.",type 2 diabetics

Cardiometabolic disease characterized by obesity, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remain an important cause of mortality. Evidence using mouse models of obesity and insulin resistance indicates that Rap1 deficiency increases proatherogenic PCSK9 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and predisposes these mice to develop obesity- and statin-induced hyperglycemia, which highlights Rap1's role in cardiometabolic dysfunction. Rap1 may also contribute to cardiovascular disease through its effects on vascular wall cells involved in the atherosclerosis progression.

This focus is reflected in conference topics, strategy documents, technology appraisals and funding streams. What is often overlooked is the wider application of data and AI, as demonstrated through published literature and emerging marketplace products, that offers promising avenues for enhanced clinical care, health-service efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This review provides an overview of AI techniques and explores the use and potential of AI and data-driven systems in a broad context, covering all diabetes types, encompassing: (1) patient education and self-management; (2) clinical decision support systems and predictive analytics, including diagnostic support, treatment and screening advice, complications prediction; and (3) the use of multimodal data, such as imaging or genetic data. The review provides a perspective on how data- and AI-driven systems could transform diabetes care in the coming years and how they could be integrated into daily clinical practice. We discuss evidence for benefits and potential harms, and consider existing barriers to scalable adoption, including challenges related to data availability and exchange, health inequality, clinician hesitancy and regulation. Stakeholders, including clinicians, academics, commissioners, policymakers and those with lived experience, must proactively collaborate to realise the potential benefits that AI-supported diabetes care could bring, whilst mitigating risk and navigating the challenges along the way.",type 2 diabetics
A high-throughput structural dynamics approach for identification of potential agonists of FFAR4 for type 2 diabetes mellitus therapy.,"['DivyaJhinjharia', 'Aman ChandraKaushik', 'ShaktiSahi']","Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that persists as a global threat to the world. A G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), free fatty acid receptor 4 (FFAR4), has emerged as a potential target for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity-related disorders. The current study has investigated the FFAR4, deploying 3-dimensional structure modeling, molecular docking, machine learning, and high-throughput virtual screening methods to unravel the receptor's crucial and non-crucial binding site residues. We screened four lakh compounds and shortlisted them based on binding energy, stereochemical considerations, non-bonded interactions, and pharmacokinetic profiling. Out of the screened compounds, four compounds were selected for ligand-bound simulations. The molecular dynamic simulations were carried out for 1µs for native FFAR4 and 500 ns each for complexes of FFAR4 with compound 1, compound 2, compound 3, and compound 4. Our findings showed that in addition to reported binding site residues ARG99, ARG183, and VAL98 in known agonists like TUG-891, the amino acids ARG22, ARG24, THR23, TRP305, and GLU43 were also critical binding site residues. These amino acids impart stability to the FFAR4 complexes and contribute to the stronger binding affinity of the compounds. The study also indicated that aromatic residues like PHE211 are crucial for recognizing the active site's pi-pi and C-C double bonds. Since FFAR4 is a membrane protein, the simulation studies give an insight into the mechanisms of the crucial protein-lipid and lipid-water interactions. The analysis of the molecular dynamics trajectories showed all four compounds as potential hit molecules that can be developed further into potential agonists for T2DM therapy. Amongst the four compounds, compound 4 showed relatively better binding affinity, stronger non-bonded interactions, and a stable complex.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.",type 2 diabetics

ILI focused on achieving weight loss through decreased caloric intake and increased physical activity. We assessed the parent trial's primary composite CVD outcome. We evaluated additive and multiplicative heterogeneity of the intervention on CVD risk by baseline HbA1c.
Mean baseline HbA1c was 7.3% (SD 1.2) and ranged from 4.4% (quintile 1) to 14.5% (quintile 5). We observed additive and multiplicative heterogeneity of the association between ILI and CVD (all p<0.001) by baseline HbA1c. Randomization to ILI was associated with lower CVD risk for HbA1c quintiles 1 (HR: 0.68, 95%: 0.53, 0.88) and 2 (HR: 0.80, 95%: 0.66, 0.96) and associated with higher CVD risk for HbA1c quintile 5 (HR: 1.27, 95%: 1.02, 1.58), compared to DSE.
Among adults with type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity, randomization to a lifestyle intervention was differentially associated with CVD risk by baseline HbA1c such that it was associated with lower risk at lower HbA1c levels and higher risk at higher HbA1c levels. There is a critical need to develop and tailor lifestyle interventions to be successful for individuals with type 2 diabetes and high HbA1c.",type 2 diabetics
Research progress on the relationship between bile acid metabolism and type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"['YisenHou', 'XinzheZhai', 'XiaotaoWang', 'YiWu', 'HeyueWang', 'YaxinQin', 'JianliHan', 'YongMeng']","Bile acids, which are steroid molecules originating from cholesterol and synthesized in the liver, play a pivotal role in regulating glucose metabolism and maintaining energy balance. Upon release into the intestine alongside bile, they activate various nuclear and membrane receptors, influencing crucial processes. These bile acids have emerged as significant contributors to managing type 2 diabetes mellitus, a complex clinical syndrome primarily driven by insulin resistance. Bile acids substantially lower blood glucose levels through multiple pathways: BA-FXR-SHP, BA-FXR-FGFR15/19, BA-TGR5-GLP-1, and BA-TGR5-cAMP. They also impact blood glucose regulation by influencing intestinal flora, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and bitter taste receptors. Collectively, these regulatory mechanisms enhance insulin sensitivity, stimulate insulin secretion, and boost energy expenditure. This review aims to comprehensively explore the interplay between bile acid metabolism and T2DM, focusing on primary regulatory pathways. By examining the latest advancements in our understanding of these interactions, we aim to illuminate potential therapeutic strategies and identify areas for future research. Additionally, this review critically assesses current research limitations to contribute to the effective management of T2DM.",type 2 diabetics
"Dietary practice and associated factors among type 2 diabetic patients attending chronic follow-up in public hospitals, central Ethiopia, 2022.","['DuretiTirfessa', 'MitsiwatAbebe', 'JiregnaDarega', 'MechaAboma']","Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is affecting numerous Ethiopian populations regardless of environmental and social status. Diabetic people all over the world are commonly urged to acquire a healthy eating habit, which necessitates lifelong changes in food habits, beliefs, and meal patterns. Dietary management is considered one of the cornerstones of diabetes care, as it is an important component of the overall treatment plan. Choosing and following a healthy diet is important for everyone, especially people with diabetes.
This study aims to assess dietary practices and associated factors among type 2 diabetes patients in the west Shewa Zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia, in 2022.
A hospital-based cross-sectional study design was conducted in West Shewa Zone public hospitals among 421 randomly selected type 2 diabetic patients from February 1 to March 30, 2022. Data were collected using a structured and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were done using SPSS.
In this study, about 35.6% (95% CI: 30.9-39.9) of type 2 diabetes patients had good dietary practices. Diabetes knowledge (AOR 9 2; 95% CI 4.4-19.4), food-secured households (AOR 3.3; 95% CI 1.6-6.9), high self-efficacy (AOR 6.6; 95% CI 3.2-13.9), diabetes diet information from healthcare professionals (AOR 2.9; 95% CI 1.3-6.4), complete dietary change (AOR = 2.3; 95% CI 1.1-4.8), and female gender (AOR 3.6; 95% CI 1.6-8.1) were independent predictors of good dietary practice.
The proportion of patients with type 2 diabetes, who attended follow-up at West Shawa Public Hospitals and practiced good dietary habits, was low. Patients' household food insecurity, diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, source of information on the diabetic diet, complete dietary change after diabetes diagnosis, and gender were all significantly associated with type 2 diabetic patients' dietary practices. Thus, promoting the provision of continuous, modified, and comprehensive education and advice on the importance of diabetes self-management, particularly adherence to dietary recommendations, is fundamental to decreasing the burden of diabetes complications and massive health expenses among diabetic patients.",type 2 diabetics
Evaluation of the effectiveness regarding the participation of pharmacists in perioperative blood glucose management via the iGMS: a pilot RCT.,"['JinfangSong', 'XiaojunPan', 'YaChen', 'YongjuanDing', 'XiaLi']","Excellent blood glucose management is a key guarantee for successful progress of surgery. However, the impact of clinical pharmacists on blood glucose management of perioperative patients needs to be further investigated. To investigate the effectiveness regarding the participation of pharmacists in blood glucose management via the informatized glucose management system (iGMS) on perioperative patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
The working mode of clinical pharmacists participating in blood glucose management of perioperative patients with diabetes was constructed. A total of 300 patients with T2DM who underwent elective surgery were recruited and divided into a clinical pharmacist management group (intervention group) of 150 patients (94 men and 56 women; mean age: 44.38 ± 14.03 years) and a control group of 150 patients (101 men and 49 women; mean age: 47.85 ± 12.26 years) between September 2019 to April 2020. The outcomes of perioperative blood glucose management, and healthcare indicators such as preoperative waiting time, total hospitalization time, postoperative infection rate and other indicators were analyzed statistically between the two groups.
In the blood glucose management team of the whole hospital, the physicians, clinical pharmacists and nurses of blood glucose management in endocrinology department were the core members, and were responsible for perioperative blood glucose management of the participants in the intervention group. All subjects had lower blood glucose after 3 days of management compared to the time of admission, and blood glucose was significantly lower in the intervention group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). As compared with the control group, subjects in intervention group demonstrated significant differences in outcome measures. The relevant parameters included preoperative blood glucose compliance rate (60.67% vs. 35.33%, P<0.05), preoperative waiting time [(5.27 ± 3.34) vs. (7.45 ± 4.38), P<0.05], length of hospitalization [(11.11 ± 4.56) vs. (14.87 ± 5.39), P<0.05], incidence of hypoglycemia (8.67% vs. 18.00%, P<0.05), incidence of hyperglycemia (32.00% vs. 62.67%, P<0.05) and postoperative infection rate (18.00% vs. 24.67%, P > 0.05).
The involvement of clinical pharmacists in blood glucose management utilizing the iGMS can control the blood glucose level of patients with T2DM in the perioperative period more stably and effectively, thereby leading to an improvement in the quality of healthcare.",type 2 diabetics

With an estimated 463 million persons aged 20 to 79 having diabetes, the number is expected to rise to 700 million by 2045, creating a significant worldwide health burden. Polygenic variants of diabetes are influenced by environmental variables. T2D is regarded as a silent illness that can advance for years before being diagnosed. Finding genetic markers for T2D and metabolic syndrome in groups with similar environmental exposure is therefore essential to understanding the mechanism of such complex characteristic illnesses. So herein, we demonstrated the exclusive use of the collaborative cross (CC) mouse reference population to identify novel quantitative trait loci (QTL) and, subsequently, suggested genes associated with host glucose tolerance in response to a high-fat diet. In this study, we used 539 mice from 60 different CC lines. The diabetogenic effect in response to high-fat dietary challenge was measured by the three-hour intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) test after 12 weeks of dietary challenge. Data analysis was performed using a statistical software package IBM SPSS Statistic 23. Afterward, blood glucose concentration at the specific and between different time points during the IPGTT assay and the total area under the curve (AUC0-180) of the glucose clearance was computed and utilized as a marker for the presence and severity of diabetes. The observed AUC0-180 averages for males and females were 51,267.5 and 36,537.5 mg/dL, respectively, representing a 1.4-fold difference in favor of females with lower AUC0-180 indicating adequate glucose clearance. The AUC0-180 mean differences between the sexes within each specific CC line varied widely within the CC population. A total of 46 QTL associated with the different studied phenotypes, designated as T2DSL and its number, for Type 2 Diabetes Specific Locus and its number, were identified during our study, among which 19 QTL were not previously mapped. The genomic interval of the remaining 27 QTL previously reported, were fine mapped in our study. The genomic positions of 40 of the mapped QTL overlapped (clustered) on 11 different peaks or close genomic positions, while the remaining 6 QTL were unique. Further, our study showed a complex pattern of haplotype effects of the founders, with the wild-derived strains (mainly PWK) playing a significant role in the increase of AUC values.",type 2 diabetics

AR/RKIP pathway mediates the inhibitory effects of icariin on renal fibrosis and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in type 2 diabetic nephropathy.,"['WenhuiYao', 'RongpinTao', 'YueXu', 'Zhe-ShengChen', 'XuanshengDing', 'LishengWan']","Herba epimedium brevicornu maxim is traditionally known as a sexual enhancement, and has the effect of tonifying kidney yang. Icariin is a flavonoid extracted from epimedium brevicornu maxim, and has been shown to improve nephropathy disease.
This study investigated the possible role of icariin in regulating renal EndMT in type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN).
Male type 2 diabetic Sprague Dawley rats, Male D2.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J (db/db) mice, and mouse glomerular endothelial cells were utilized to evaluate the effect of icariin. Western blotting, Q-PCR, immunohistochemistry, H&E, Masson staining, immunofluorescence, and siRNA transfection, were performed in this study.
The inhibitory function of icariin in renal fibrosis and renal EndMT was verified in type 2 diabetic animals. Methyltestosterone suppressed renal fibrosis and EndMT in db/db mice. Androgen receptor (AR), the major receptor of testosterone, was upregulated by icariin. The AR antagonist MDV3100, blocked the inhibition by icariin in renal EndMT, revealing that icariin repressed renal EndMT by activating AR. In addition, icariin and methyltestosterone upregulated the Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) in db/db mice. Furthermore, siRNA-RKIP inhibited the effect of icariin on EndMT. The MEK/ERK pathway, as the downstream pathway of RKIP, was suppressed by icariin and methyltestosterone. Of note, the effect of icariin on the MEK/ERK pathway was abolished by MDV3100 or siRNA-RKIP.
These results supported that icariin targeted AR/RKIP/MEK/ERK pathway to suppress renal fibrosis and EndMT in T2DN.",type 2 diabetics
A comparative study of plasma and dried blood spot metabolomics and its application to diabetes mellitus.,"['Huai-HsuanChiu', 'Shin-YiLin', 'Chen-GuangZhang', 'Chuan-ChingTsai', 'Sung-ChunTang', 'Ching-HuaKuo']","Metabolomics has become a promising method for understanding pathological mechanisms.

However, how results obtained from DBS can be correlated to results obtained from PLS remains unclear. To bridge the results and to investigate the feasibility of using DBS to study metabolomics, we performed a comparative study using 64 paired PLS and DBS samples. The number of features extracted from the two different sample types was investigated. The concentration correlations of the identified metabolites between the DBS and PLS were individually studied. Approximately 47 % showed a strong correlation, 19 % showed a moderate correlation, and 34 % showed a low or even negligible correlation. Finally, we applied both PLS- and DBS-based metabolomics to explore the dysregulated metabolites in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. Thirty-two non-DM subjects and 32 DM patients were enrolled, and 2 significant metabolites were found in both PLS and DBS samples. In summary, detailed correlation information between PLS and DBS metabolites was first explored in this study, and it is anticipated that these results could facilitate future applications in DBS-based metabolomics.",type 2 diabetics
Generation of autoantibodies against glycated fibrinogen: Role in diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy.,"['AfreenKhanam', 'SultanAlouffi', 'Amjad RAlyahyawi', 'ArbabHusain', 'SaifKhan', 'TalalAlharazi', 'RihabAkasha', 'HamdaKhan', 'UzmaShahab', 'SaheemAhmad']","The process of glycation, characterized by the non-enzymatic reaction between sugars and free amino groups on biomolecules, is a key contributor to the development and progression of both microvascular and macrovascular complications associated with diabetes, particularly due to persistent hyperglycemia. This glycation process gives rise to advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which play a central role in the pathophysiology of diabetes complications, including nephropathy. The d-ribose-mediated glycation of fibrinogen plays a central role in the pathogenesis of diabetes nephropathy (DN) and retinopathy (DR) by the generation and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Glycated fibrinogen with d-ribose (Rb-gly-Fb) induces structural changes that trigger an autoimmune response by generating and exposing neoepitopes on fibrinogen molecules. The present research is designed to investigate the prevalence of autoantibodies against Rb-gly-Fb in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), DN & DR. Direct binding ELISA was used to test the binding affinity of autoantibodies from patients' sera against Rb-gly-Fb and competitive ELISA was used to confirm the direct binding findings by checking the bindings of isolated IgG against Rb-gly-Fb and its native conformer. In comparison to healthy subjects, 32% of T2DM, 67% of DN and 57.85% of DR patients' samples demonstrated a strong binding affinity towards Rb-gly-Fb. Both native and Rb-gly-Fb binding by healthy subjects (HS) sera were non-significant (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the early, intermediate, and end products of glycation have been assessed through biochemical and physicochemical analysis. The biochemical markers in the patient groups were also significant (p < 0.05) in comparison to the HS group. This study not only establishes the prevalence of autoantibodies against d-ribose glycated fibrinogen in DN but also highlights the potential of glycated fibrinogen as a biomarker for the detection of DN and/or DR. These insights may open new avenues for research into novel therapeutic strategies and the prevention of diabetes-related nephropathy and retinopathy.",type 2 diabetics

To understand the views and experiences of patients and health professionals on herbal treatments for self-management of T2DM.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SOCIOFILE and Google Scholar were searched for qualitative studies in T2DM patients about their views on herbal medicines. Included papers were analysed using thematic synthesis.
Thirty-one papers (about 30 studies) were included: 20 from low-and-middle income countries, 10 from high income countries, and 1 internet-based study. Almost all studies from high income countries focussed on ethnic minorities. Many people with T2DM wanted a ""cure"", and often took advice from friends and family, but also traditional healers and mass media. However, they were reluctant to discuss herbal medicines with health professionals, whom they perceived as ""closed-minded"". They based their treatment decisions on personal experience (from ""trial-and-error""), availability, cost and convenience of both herbal and conventional medicines. Most health professionals were reluctant to discuss herbal medicines, or recommended against their use, because of lack of knowledge and concerns about their quality, efficacy and potential interactions.

Diabetic and nondiabetic BMSC-derived exosomes affect bone regeneration via regulating miR-17-5p/SMAD7 axis.,"['ZechuanLi', 'BingZhang', 'JiamingShang', 'YananWang', 'LingluJia', 'XiaoShe', 'XinXu', 'DongjiaoZhang', 'JingGuo', 'FanZhang']","Diabetic bone disease (DBD) is a complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and is characterized by impaired osteocyte function and delayed bone remodeling due to high blood glucose levels and sustained release of inflammatory factors. Recent studies show that the regulation of osteoblasts (OBs) by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) is an important mechanism in alleviating DBD and that exosomes are recognized as the key medium. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosome (MSC-Exos) therapy is a promising approach to facilitate tissue repair. However, the influence of exosomes from diabetic conditioned BMSCs on OBs and bone regeneration, as well as the underlying mechanism, are still elusive. Here, we used high-glucose medium to mimic diabetic conditions and normal-glucose medium as control to mimic nondiabetic conditions in vitro and found that microRNA-17 (miR-17) was downregulated in diabetic-conditioned BMSC-derived exosomes (HG-Exos), HG-Exo-co-cultured osteoblasts, and the skull of rats with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Further experiment concluded that nondiabetic conditioned BMSC-Exos (NG-Exos) promoted the osteogenesis of OBs and bone regeneration of rats with T2DM via upregulation of miR-17. Compare with NG-Exos, HG-Exos impeded osteogenesis of OBs in vitro and bone regeneration of rats in vivo by downregulation of miR-17. Moreover, miR-17 promoted bone regeneration by targeting SMAD7, which was further proved to have a negative effect on osteogenesis. Taken together, nondiabetic BMSC-derived exosomes greatly foster bone regeneration, whereas diabetic BMSC-derived exosomes undermine the promotion effect of MSC-Exos by regulating the miR-17/SMAD7 axis. These findings provide support for the miR-17-5p/SMAD7 axis as a promising therapeutic target to treat DBD.",type 2 diabetics

Purposive sampling was used to recruit 27 patients until data saturation is happened. Semi-structured one-on-one in-depth interviews that were audio-recorded were used to collect data which was then transcribed and manually analyzed using thematic analysis method.
This study found four main themes namely Knowledge and its determinants, Perceptions on personal practice and health care practice, Health seeking behaviors and Factors affecting footwear practices. T2DM patients had varying levels of knowledge about DFU and these levels of knowledge were attributed to lack of advice from healthcare providers, personal beliefs, culture and societal norms and lack of resources. Patients continued to practice self-care practices that they perceived to protect their feet from trauma and such practices have been passed down through a traditional knowledge system including stigma and beliefs. Culture and personal habits greatly impacted the practice of wearing footwear. Societal norms and traditions greatly impact how T2DM patients take care of their feet and their health in general.
Understanding personal beliefs and traditional influences surrounding the patients' environment is paramount in order to effectively implement public health prevention strategies against DFU.",type 2 diabetics

This systematic review followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews guidelines. Original articles from Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane, published until June 16th 2023, and tackling the effect of BMS on disease outcomes in patients with RA were included.
Three studies met the inclusion criteria. They were published between 2015 and 2022. The total number of RA patients was 33193 and 6700 of them underwent BMS. Compared to non-surgical patients, weight loss after BMS was associated with lower disease activity outcomes at 12 months (p<0.05). Similarly, prior BMS in RA patients was significantly associated with reduced odds ratios for all the morbidities and in-hospital mortality compared with no prior BMS (36.5% vs 54.6%, OR = 0.45, 95% CI (0.42, 0.48), p< 0.001) and (0.4% vs 0.9%, OR = 0.41, 95% CI (0.27-0.61), p < 0.001) respectively.

This study aimed to characterize retinal EC heterogeneity and functional diversity using single-cell RNA sequencing. Systematic analysis of cellular compositions and cell-cell interaction networks identified a unique EC cluster with high inflammatory gene expression in diabetic retina; sphingolipid metabolism is a prominent aspect correlated with changes in retinal function. Among sphingolipid-related genes, alkaline ceramidase 2 (ACER2) showed the most significant increase. Plasma samples of patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) with or without diabetic macular edema (DME) and active PDR were collected for mass spectrometry analysis. Metabolomic profiling revealed that the ceramide levels were significantly elevated in NPDR-NDME/DME and further increased in active PDR compared with control patients. In vitro analyses showed that ACER2 overexpression retarded endothelial barrier breakdown induced by ceramide, while silencing of ACER2 further disrupted the injury. Moreover, intravitreal injection of the recombinant ACER2 adeno-associated virus rescued diabetes-induced vessel leakiness, inflammatory response, and neurovascular disease in diabetic mouse models.

Canagliflozin ameliorates high glucose-induced apoptosis in NRK-52E cells via inhibiting oxidative stress and activating AMPK/mTOR-mediated autophagy.,"['HongLiu', 'WeidongChen', 'ShengWan', 'YeChen', 'MengjingFu', 'ZengsiWang', 'FeiXiong', 'YanminZhang']","Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, as a new type of hypoglycemic drug, can prevent proximal renal tubule injury related to glucose toxicity and play a renoprotective role. Canagliflozin, a recognized SGLT-2 inhibitor, has been proved to have potential protection in diabetic nephropathy (DN), but its mechanism has not been fully elucidated. In this study, the protective effect of canagliflozin against high glucose (HG)-induced renal tubular epithelial cell (NRK-52E) injury in vitro was assessed.
The viability and apoptosis of NRK-52E cells were detected using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The expression levels of cleaved caspase-3, oxidative stress-related proteins (NOX4 and Nrf2), autophagy marker light chain 3 (LC3) I/II, and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway-related proteins were evaluated by Western blot. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was evaluated by dihydroethidium (DHE) reactive oxygen species assay, the activities of SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and MDA were analyzed using kits. The changes of morphology and red fluorescent protein (RFP)-LC3 fluorescence were observed under microscopy.
Canagliflozin significantly ameliorated HG-induced NRK-52E cell apoptosis and caspase-3 cleavage. Furthermore, canagliflozin markedly ameliorated HG-induced NRK-52E cell oxidative stress. Moreover, canagliflozin significantly increased LC3-II levels and induced RFP-LC3-containing punctate structures in NRK-52E cells. Finally, canagliflozin increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and suppressed the phosphorylation of mTOR. The AMPK inhibitor compound C abolished canagliflozin-induced autophagy activation, as well as the anti-apoptotic effect of canagliflozin.
Canagliflozin effectively ameliorate HG-induced apoptosis of NRK-52E cells in vitro that involved its antioxidant effect and induction of autophagy through the AMPK/mTOR pathway.",type 2 diabetics
School-based health: an area of opportunity to address challenges in management of pediatric obesity and type 2 diabetes.,"['Aurelia C HWood', 'KeeleyPratt']","Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are increasingly common, chronic, and complex and disproportionally affect systemically under-resourced communities negatively impacted by social determinants of health. The primary goals of management for both conditions are improvement of medical and psychosocial well being and prevention of secondary complications. The advent of pediatric specific multidisciplinary weight management programs, bariatric surgery, and recent FDA approved medications have provided clinicians with tools to improve patient outcomes. However, implementation remains a challenge.
The Chronic Care Model proposes utilization of community-based interventions to support children and families in managing chronic disease The CDC's Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child Model provides a framework for schools to engage in this role. School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) utilize a child-focused, multidisciplinary approach to support the medical home and overcome barriers to routine primary care, medical screenings and successful care plans for management of chronic disease. SBHCs and school-based programs have proven sustainable and effective in addressing obesity and T2D in youth, however recent studies are limited and more research evaluating impact are needed.
School-based health offers an evidence-based solution to ensuring equitable and comprehensive care for obesity and T2D, particularly among at-risk communities.",type 2 diabetics
A review of recent research and development on GLP-1 receptor agonists-sustained-release microspheres.,"['ZejingGao', 'YiWei', 'GuanghuiMa']","Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are increasingly used in treating type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, owing to their limited oral bioavailability, most commercially available GLP-1 RAs are administered through frequent subcutaneous injections, which may result in poor patient compliance during clinical treatment. To improve patients' compliance, sustained-release GLP-1 RA-loaded microspheres have been explored. This review is an overview of recent progress and research in GLP-1 RA-loaded microspheres. First, the fabrication methods of GLP-1 RA-loaded microspheres including the coacervation method, emulsion-solvent evaporation method based on agitation, premix membrane emulsification technology, spray drying, microfluidic droplet technology, and supercritical fluid technology are summarized. Next, the strategies for maintaining GLP-1 RAs' stability and activity in microspheres by adding additives and PEGylation are reviewed. Finally, the effect of particle size, drug distribution, the internal structure of microspheres, and the hydrogel/microsphere composite strategy on improved release behavior is summarized.",type 2 diabetics
Combined efficacy of low-calorie diets and aerobic training on nutritional status of obese patients with early type 2 diabetes.,"['J-WWang', 'D-JAi', 'N-RDing', 'HWu']","The purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined efficacy of low-calorie diets and aerobic training on the nutritional status of obese patients with early type 2 diabetes mellitus.
120 consecutive obese patients with early type 2 diabetes were admitted to our hospital between August 2021 and December 2022. The patients enrolled were equally and randomly allocated into the control group (60 cases, given conventional diabetes diet intervention) and the study group (60 cases, given a low-calorie diet intervention combined with aerobic training). The parameters, including the nutritional status, fasting insulin (FINS), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), blood lipid level, and quality of life, were compared between the two groups.
Before treatment, there were no measurable differences in the levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc), albumin (ALB), prealbumin (PA), and hemoglobin (Hb) between the two groups (p>0.05), whereas two months after treatment, the FBG, 2hPG, and HbAIc levels were greatly lower, and the levels of ALB, PA, and Hb were significantly higher in the study group than those in the control group (p<0.05). Before treatment, no statistically significant differences were found in FINS and HOMA-IR values between the two groups (p>0.05). Two months after treatment, however, the study group showed lower FINS and HOMA-IR values as compared to the control group, with statistically significant differences (p<0.05). Before treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in the levels of triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) between the two groups (p>0.05), while the four levels in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group two months after treatment (p<0.05). Similarly, there were no statistically significant differences in scores of physiological, psychological, social, and therapy-related problems between the two groups before treatment (p>0.05), whereas the abovementioned scores were evidently higher in the study group than control group two months after treatment (p<0.05).
A low-calorie diet intervention combined with aerobic training exerted good effects in terms of greatly enhancing the nutritional status among obese patients with early type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was deemed appropriate for clinical promotion and implementation.",type 2 diabetics
Statin therapy for patients with diabetic nephropathy: balance between safety and efficacy of statin treatment for patients with impaired kidney function.,"['A AJairoun', 'C CPing', 'BIbrahim']","The International Diabetes Federation estimates that by 2035, there will be 592 million people with diabetes worldwide, substantially increasing from the 382 million patients with diabetes recorded in 2013. Diabetes-related nephropathy is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Recently, the therapeutic use of statins in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was explored in a series of meta-analyses, which revealed their potential for decreasing mortality and cardiovascular complications in this population, although not in patients undergoing hemodialysis. The current study reviews the current state of knowledge on statin therapy regarding its safety and efficacy concerning renal outcomes in diabetic patients with CKD. The evidence shows that statins may offer a beneficial renoprotective effect in inhibiting the progression of renal function decline. This effect is time-dependent and particularly strong in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. In addition, whether certain statin types are more beneficial than others in slowing renal function loss and reducing proteinuria remains unclear. Prior research has not examined the impact of high-intensity statin therapy on CKD patient outcomes.",type 2 diabetics

GDM can be resolved on its own after birth, but mothers with GDM are more at risk for future problems, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. In addition, GDM can cause macrosomia in infants and obesity or even the risk of diabetes in childhood. Standard diagnostic tests for GDM are the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and glucose challenge test (GCT), which is a mandatory test at 28-28 weeks of pregnancy in most countries. Disorders in various molecular mechanisms, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling pathways are involved in GDM. Therefore, a better understanding of these mechanisms can help find new therapeutic and diagnostic strategies accordingly. In this review, we first deal with molecular mechanisms involved in GDM occurrence and then summarized the studies that hired this knowledge for early diagnosis and prognosis of GDM. Finally, we present the latest achievements in the diagnosis of GDM based on exosomes, microRNAs, glycosylated hemoglobin, and inflammatory factors detection in maternal circulation.",type 2 diabetics

In patients with type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM), the function of these tissues is impaired. The positive effects of exercise have been shown in diabetic patients. To demonstrate the positive effects of exercise in T1DM, we examined the effects of moderate-intensity endurance training (MIET) on the liver enzymes and expression of MCT1 and GLUT4 genes.
Male Wistar rats were allocated into 4 groups of control (C), training (T), diabetic control (DC), and diabetes + training (DT). The serum levels of liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were determined by ELIZA. MCT1 and GLUT4 mRNA expressions in the liver and pancreas tissues were evaluated through real-time qPCR after 10 weeks of training.
The mRNA levels of MCT1 and GLUT4 decreased in DC group and increased in DT group. T1DM led to weight loss, but the weight loss was less in the DT group. T1DM caused an increase in liver enzymes such as ALT, AST and ALP, whereas endurance training preserved enzymatic levels.
These results suggested that MIET increases levels of MCT1 and GLUT4 liver and pancreas in the diabetic rats and improves liver function tests. Upregulation of MCT1 and GLUT4 can probably improve the function of liver and pancreas tissues and promote glucose homeostasis in T1DM.",type 2 diabetics

A cost-effectiveness analysis of linagliptin add-on to insulin treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease in Iran.,"['Soroush AhmadiFariman', 'MarziehNosrati', 'ParhamRahmani', 'ShekoufehNikfar']","With the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), determining optimal treatment strategies has become a major concern. Linagliptin is aDPP-4 inhibitor that does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of adding linagliptin to insulin therapy in patients with T2DM and mild (stage 2) or moderate (stage 3) CKD from a health system perspective in Iran.
We developed a cost-utility model using a decision tree and ran it separately for T2DM patients with mild or moderate CKD. Clinical outcomes and health-state utility values were extracted from published studies. Direct medical costs were obtained from national tariffs in Iran in 2021. We adopted an annual time horizon and calculated the difference in costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to obtain the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). To capture parameter uncertainties, one-way sensitivity analyses were also performed.
In T2DM patients with mild CKD, the linagliptin add-on strategy was associated with an additional $23.69 cost and 0.0148 QALYs per patient, resulting in an ICER of 1600.37 USD/QALY. In moderate CKD, the strategy was associated with $22.59 more costs and 0.0191 more QALYs, and the ICER was estimated at 1182.72 USD/QALY. In both populations, the ICER was mainly driven by the impact of HbA1c on utility, cost of linagliptin, and the reduction in insulin usage by adding linagliptin to the treatment.
With a cost-effectiveness threshold of $1550 USD/QALY in Iran, adding linagliptin to insulin is cost-effective in patients with T2DM and moderate CKD. However, for those with mild CKD, it seems that the associated costs outweigh the expected benefits.

Diabetic stem cell therapy and nanomedicine: advancements in treating diabetes.,"['KamyarKhoshnevisan', 'Sayed MahmoudSajjadi-Jazi']","In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of medical sciences, particularly in the treatment of diabetes using innovative methods. Diabetes, a chronic metabolic disorder considered by elevated blood glucose levels, disturbs millions of people worldwide.
Conventional treatments for diabetes have shown limited success in providing long-term solutions, leading researchers to explore alternative therapies such as diabetic stem cell therapy and nanomedicine. In this article, we delve into the promising potential of these cutting-edge treatments and their impact on diabetes management.
Several achievements have been obtained to treat diabetes type I by merging nanomedicine and cell therapy such as insulin-loaded exosomes and nanoparticles loaded with different drugs. For instance, by engineering exosomes with specific nanocarriers, researchers can precisely deliver some molecules to target cells, promoting tissue repair and regeneration.

The Effects of Eight Weeks of Circuit Resistance Training on Serum METRNL Levels and Insulin Resistance in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.,"['Seyed MortezaTayebi', 'MiladGolmohammadi', 'RasoulEslami', 'NadiaShakiba', 'Pablo BCosta']","The effects of exercise training on meteorin-like protein (METRNL), one of the newest factors involved, is one of the treatment strategies for diabetes. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of circuit resistance training on METRNL and insulin resistance in people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).
Twenty eligible diabetics volunteered to participate and were randomly divided into control (n = 10, age = 51 ± 1 years, BMI = 27.43 ± 0.98 kg/m
METRNL did not change significantly in the control group (0.66 ± 0.06 to 0.7 ± 0.04), but it increased significantly in the experimental group (0.3 ± 0.06 to 0.71 ± 0.03, p = 0.001); In contrast, FBS increased significantly in the control group (122.8 ± 7.5 to 192.8 ± 14.9) and decreased significantly in the experimental group (197.2 ± 7.1 to 135.00 ± 14.00, p = 0.001). Insulin in control and experimental groups did not change significantly (p = 0.96); However, the IR of the control group increased significantly (6.37 ± 1.46 to 9.6 ± 1.53), but its level was significantly attenuated in the experimental group (4.89 ± 1.37 to 4.38 ± 1.44, p = 0.028).

Letter to the editor: alarming prevalence of comorbid conditions in adults with type 2 diabetes in Iran.,"['GolnazAzami', 'BosharaEbrahimy']","One of the key challenges that healthcare continues to face is the ongoing epidemiological transition from communicable diseases to non-communicable diseases. In Iran, it is expected that the number of patients with non-communicable diseases will increase because of the growing prevalence of the Western lifestyle, nutritional transition, and the aging of society. As the elderly population continues to grow, cardiovascular diseases have progressively replaced communicable diseases as the leading cause of mortality. In 2016, ischemic heart diseases, cerebrovascular accidents, hypertension, and diabetes were the first, second, fourth, and sixth leading causes of mortality respectively. Like many patients with a chronic disease, most Iranians with diabetes have at least one comorbid condition. Diabetes-related comorbidities increase the healthcare demands, cost, and risk of poor patient outcomes. Although a growing body of evidence indicates that the type and severity of the comorbid conditions matter, less attention has been paid to studying how they influence diabetes care. Further research should continue to focus on furthering our understanding of management strategies to enhance the quality of care for diabetes patients having comorbidities.

This research sought to establish a relationship between the dietary levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and the risk of T2DM.
This case-control study was carried out on 4200 participants consisting of 589 people with T2DM and 3611 non-diabetic aged 35 to 70 years residents in Sabzevar, Iran. Data on the economic-social, employment status, medical history, lifestyle, and sleep habits were collected via interview. The food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to check the nutritional status. Participants' dietary BCAA consumption was estimated using Nutritionist IV software.
A significant negative association between the incidence of T2DM and the dietary levels of BCAAs after adjustment for age and sex (OR = 0.972, CI 95%:0.648-0.996, P = 0.022).

Unraveling the link between insulin resistance and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease): A Narrative Review.,"['FatemeZiamanesh', 'MehdiMohammadi', 'SholehEbrahimpour', 'OzraTabatabaei-Malazy', 'AsiehMosallanejad', 'BagherLarijani']","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is rapidly becoming a significant global health concern, representing the leading cause of chronic liver disease and posing a substantial public health challenge. NAFLD is associated with higher insulin resistance (IR) levels, a key pathophysiological mechanism contributing to its development and progression. To counter this growing trend, it is crucial to raise awareness about NAFLD and promote healthy lifestyles to mitigate the impact of this disease.
Relevant studies regarding IR and NAFLD published until May 30, 2023, were extracted from Google PubMed, Scopus, and Web Of Science web databases. The following keywords were used: IR, diabetes mellitus, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and metabolic syndrome.
IR leads to an accumulation of fatty acids within liver cells, resulting from increased glycolysis and decreased apolipoprotein B-100. Furthermore, the manifestations of NAFLD extend beyond liver-related morbidity and mortality, affecting multiple organs and giving rise to various non-communicable disorders such as diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovary syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and cardiovascular disease. Although lifestyle modification remains the primary treatment approach for NAFLD, alternative therapies, including pharmacological, herbal, and surgical interventions, may be considered. By implementing early and simple measures, cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma can be prevented.
There is a clear association between NAFLD and elevated levels of IR. Several metabolic conditions, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome, are closely interrelated with NAFLD and IR. Raising awareness about NAFLD and promoting a healthy lifestyle are crucial steps to reverse the impact of this disease.",type 2 diabetics

The risk of coronary artery diseases is much higher in diabetic patients and is associated with greater morbidity and mortality. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI) is an important prognostic biomarker in cardiac diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of empagliflozin compared to placebo on changes in hs-cTnI and lipid profile after 26 weeks of treatment.
This was an ancillary study in a randomized trial of patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and coronary artery disease (CAD) (The EMPA-CARD study). Patients who were already on standard anti-diabetic/anti-ischemic medications were randomized to receive either placebo or empagliflozin 10 mg/daily. Serum hs-cTnI and lipid profile were measured at baseline and after 26 weeks.
Of the 95 randomized patients, hs-cTnI and lipid profile were measured for a total of 77 patients. No significant difference was observed regarding the baseline characteristics between the two arms. Compared to placebo, empagliflozin significantly reduced hs-cTnI after 26 weeks (mean difference (MD) of -13.242, 95%CI: -14.151 to -12.333, 
Empagliflozin compared to placebo was superior in reducing circulating hs-cTnI that may indicate improvements in cardiomyocytes function in patients with T2DM and CAD. Moreover, empagliflozin had a modest impact on the serum lipid profile biomarkers.

We investigated whether the humero-femoral index (HFI) was associated with prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and assessed the incremental value of HFI as a marker of T2DM.
This population-based cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2018. We assessed 42,088 adults aged ≥ 30 years. HFI was defined as the upper arm length/upper leg length ratio. The outcome included undiagnosed diabetes (based on 2-hour plasma glucose levels, fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1C) and history of diabetes (diagnosed diabetes or taking antidiabetic drugs).
As compared with the bottom quartile, the prevalence ratio of T2DM was 1.28 (95% CI 1.19-1.38) in the second, 1.61 (95% CI 1.50-1.72) in the third, and 1.75 (95% CI 1.64-1.88) in the fourth quartile of HFI (
Our findings suggest that HFI may be a key component in body structure contributing to the risk of T2DM. In men, the highest HFI was associated with elevated prevalence of T2DM, independent of BMI and WC.

A thorough literature review was conducted to gather relevant studies and articles on the relationship between T2DM and sarcopenia. Various databases were searched, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct databases. The search terms included T2DM, sarcopenia, inflammation, insulin resistance, advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, muscle dimensions, muscle strength, muscle performance, aging, nutrition, hormone levels, and physical activity. The collected articles were critically analysed to extract key findings and identify gaps in current research.
The prevalence and incidence of metabolic and musculoskeletal disorders, notably T2DM and sarcopenia, have surged in recent years. T2DM is marked by inflammation, insulin resistance, accumulation of advanced glycation end products, and oxidative stress, while sarcopenia involves a progressive decline in skeletal muscle mass and function. The review underscores the age-related correlation between sarcopenia and adverse outcomes like fractures, falls, and mortality. Research gaps regarding optimal nutritional interventions for individuals with T2DM and sarcopenia are identified, emphasizing the necessity for further investigation in this area.
The reciprocal interplay between T2DM and sarcopenia holds significant importance. Further research is warranted to address knowledge gaps, particularly in utilizing precise measurement tools during clinical trials. Lifestyle modifications appear beneficial for individuals with T2DM and sarcopenia. Additionally, practical nutritional interventions require investigation to optimize healthcare practices in hospital settings.

Following the GBD-2019 study, young-onset type 2 diabetes mortality, premature mortality, years lived with disability and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) are reported.
A significant increase in the overall number of deaths attributed to young-onset T2D was found. There was a non-significant decrease in mortality rates for both sexes across most age groups. DALYs in men were greater than that in women, with almost half attributed to premature death in males, while disability accounted for two thirds of DALYs in females. The DALY rate increased significantly in most states. Premature mortality decreased, while disability increased across all age-groups, and in all states for both sexes.
The surge in disability corresponded to the upsurge in obesity and overweight rates in Mexico among the younger population.

An analysis of a database called ""Health Card"" was performed in order to evaluate all prescriptions for the new classes of medications used for type 2 diabetes.
New legislation called ""note 100"" was introduced in early 2022, outlining the eligibility of certain categories of drugs used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus for direct prescription by primary care physicians in Italy. This investigation therefore delves into an examination of the prescribing patterns related to these drugs, contrasting the year 2021, prior to the implementation of Note 100, with the year 2022, following the incorporation of the new legislation. The result resulted in an exponential increase in prescriptions and consumption (+ 38%) and increased healthcare spending of more than three million euros for these drug categories.

Practical guidelines recommend an accurate estimation of the risk of these events for effective treatment and care. The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) has a risk engine for predicting CHD risk in patients with type 2 diabetes, but in some countries, it has been shown that the risk of CHD is poorly estimated. Hence, we assessed the external validity of the UKPDS risk engine in patients with type 2 diabetes identified in the national diabetes program in Iran.
The cohort included 853 patients with type 2diabetes identified between March 21, 2007, and March 20, 2018 in Lorestan province of Iran. Patients were followed for the incidence of CHD. The performance of the models was assessed in terms of discrimination and calibration. Discrimination was examined using the c-statistic and calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 statistic (HLχ2) test and a calibration plot was depicted to show the predicted risks versus observed ones.
During 7464.5 person-years of follow-up 170 first Coronary heart disease occurred. The median follow-up was 8.6 years. The UKPDS risk engine showed moderate discrimination for CHD (c-statistic was 0.72 for 10-year risk) and the calibration of the UKPDS risk engine was poor (HLχ2 = 69.9, p < 0.001) and the UKPDS risk engine78% overestimated the risk of heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes identified in the national diabetes program in Iran.
This study shows that the ability of the UKPDS Risk Engine to discriminate patients who developed CHD events from those who did not; was moderate and the ability of the risk prediction model to accurately predict the absolute risk of CHD (calibration) was poor and it overestimated the CHD risk. To improve the prediction of CHD in patients with type 2 diabetes, this model should be updated in the Iranian diabetic population.",type 2 diabetics

We used EHR data to quantify the age of three laboratory tests: serum creatinine, cholesterol, and glycated hemoglobin A1c. Encounter data were used to determine the frequency of inpatient hospitalizations and emergency department visits. Negative binomial regressions with fixed effects were performed to compute marginal effects, levels of statistical significance, and 95% confidence intervals.
The average age for serum creatinine laboratory tests was 1.51 months (95%CI: 1.49-1.53). We computed older average ages for hemoglobin A1c (mean:6.17 months; 95%CI: 6.11-6.23) and serum creatinine tests (mean: 8.73; 95%CI: 8.65-8.81). Older laboratory tests were associated with an increase in the total expected counts of subsequent inpatient hospitalizations (ME = 0.047; p < 0.001) and ED visits (ME = 0.034; p < 0.001).
Findings from this study indicate that older type 2 diabetes laboratory tests are associated with increases in the total expected count of subsequent inpatient hospitalizations and emergency department visits.

Twenty-five (25) rats were used for the study. Five rats were placed with basal diet; diets not supplemented with PM leaves (normal rat group) while twenty rats were made diabetic by feeding them with high fat diet for two weeks, prior to single injection with 35 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ). After checking with glucometer, experimental animals with blood glucose level >250 mg/dL were accepted as diabetic. The diabetic rats were subsequently divided into four groups of five rats each (n=5). The diabetic rats were placed on basal diet, or diets supplemented with PM leaves (10 % or 5 % inclusion) or sildenafil citrate (SC).
The result revealed that PM supplemented diets caused significant (p<0.05) reduction in blood glucose level, and augmented erectile function by inhibiting arginase and PDE5 activities as well as enhancing nitric oxide level.
In conclusion, dietary inclusion of PM leaves could serve as a potent nutraceutical source in hyperglycemia induced erectile dysfunction management.",type 2 diabetics
Assessment HOMA as a predictor for new onset diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications in non-diabetic adults: a KoGES prospective cohort study.,"['JibeomLee', 'Moon-HyunKim', 'Ji-YongJang', 'Chang-MyungOh']","Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is a biomarker for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

This study aimed to determine whether IR measured HOMA-IR value is associated with new onset diabetes as well as vascular disease and can be used as an early predictor for diabetes and vascular diseases in non-diabetic participants.
From a prospective community-based cohort of 10,030 individuals, 4314 individuals younger than 65 years and without diabetes were enrolled and divided into three groups by baseline HOMA-IR tertiles: low (n = 1454), moderate (n = 1414), and high (n = 1446). The primary outcome was new onset T2DM. Secondary outcomes were chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a composite of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke as macrovascular events.
The mean age was 51 years. The prevalence of hypertension and cholesterol and HbA1c were higher in the high HOMA-IR group. New onset T2DM (5.8%) and CKD (12.2%) incidence in the high HOMA-IR group was higher than that in the others. The prevalence of macrovascular events did not differ among groups. High-HOMA-IR was an independent risk factor for new onset T2DM (odds ratio 1.86 [1.17-2.96]; p = 0.01) and CKD (1.49 [1.12-1.98]; p = 0.01).
High HOMA-IR was an early predictor of new onset T2DM and CKD, regardless of HbA1c in non-diabetic individuals. Further research on the specific cut off value will be needed.",type 2 diabetics

There are many treatment options available to patients. We provide a comprehensive overview of the evidence on the treatment effects of several potential interventions for NAFLD with T2DM.
This systematic review and network meta-analysis included searches of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science from inception to June 30, 2023, for randomised controlled trials of treatment of NAFLD with T2DM. We performed Bayesian network meta-analyses to summarise effect estimates of comparisons between interventions.

A total of 81 consecutive patients with clinically suspected LGMDs from 62 unrelated families across Southeast China were recruited for targeted next-generation sequencing and whole-exome sequencing from July 2017 to February 2020.
Among 50 patients (41 families) with LGMDs, the most common subtypes were LGMD-R2/LGMD2B (36.6%) and LGMD-R1/LGMD2A (29.3%). Dystroglycanopathies (including LGMD-R9/LGMD2I, LGMD-R11/LGMD2K, LGMD-R14/LGMD2N and LGMD-R20/LGMD2U) were the most common childhood-onset subtypes and were found in 12.2% of the families.

The Australian Diabetes Alliance Program (DAP) is an integrated care model implemented in the Hunter New England Local Health District (HNELHD), New South Wales (NSW), in which endocrinologists and diabetes educators collaborate with primary care teams via case-conferencing, practice performance review, and education sessions. The objective of this study was to report on general practitioners' (GPs) perspectives on DAP and whether the program impacts on their skills, knowledge, and approach in delivering care to adult patients with type 2 diabetes.
Four primary care practices with high rates of monitoring haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels (> 90% of patients annually) and five practices with low rates of monitoring HbA1c levels (< 80% of patients annually) from HNELHD, NSW provided the sampling frame. A total of nine GPs were interviewed. The transcripts from the interviews were reviewed and analysed to identify emergent patterns and themes.
Overall, GPs were supportive of DAP. They considered that DAP resulted in significant changes in their knowledge, skills, and approach and improved the quality of diabetes care. Taking a more holistic approach to care, including assessing patients with diabetes for co-morbidities and risk factors that may impact on their future health was also noted. DAP was noted to increase the confidence levels of GPs, which enabled active involvement in the provision of diabetes care rather than referring patients for tertiary specialist care. However, some indicated the program could be time consuming and greater flexibility was needed.
GPs reported DAP to benefit their knowledge, skills and approach for managing diabetes. Future research will need to investigate how to improve the intensity and flexibility of the program based on the workload of GPs to ensure long-term acceptability of the program.",type 2 diabetics
Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibition for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and chronic kidney disease with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus: a narrative review.,"['Robert JMentz', 'Stephen ABrunton', 'JananiRangaswami']","Heart failure (HF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are common and interrelated conditions, each with a significant burden of disease. HF and kidney disease progress through pathophysiologic pathways that culminate in end-stage disease, for which T2DM is a major risk factor. Intervention within these pathways can disrupt disease processes and improve patient outcomes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have been investigated in patient populations with combinations of T2DM, CKD, and/or HF. However, until recently, the effect of these agents in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) was not well studied.
The aim of this review is to summarize key information regarding the interaction between HFpEF, CKD, and T2DM and discuss the role of SGLT2 inhibition in the management of patients with comorbid HFpEF and CKD, with or without T2DM. Literature was retrieved using Boolean searches for English-language articles in PubMed and Google Scholar and included terms related to SGLT2is, HFpEF, T2DM, and CKD. The reference lists from retrieved articles were also considered.
SGLT2is are efficacious and safe in treating HFpEF in patients with comorbid CKD with and without T2DM. The totality of evidence from clinical trials data suggests there are benefits in using SGLT2is across the spectrum of left ventricular ejection fractions, but there may be a potential for different renal effects in the different ejection fraction groups. Further analysis of these clinical trials has highlighted the need to obtain more accurate phenotypes for patients with HF and CKD to better determine which patients might respond to guideline-directed medical therapies, including SGLT2is.

In this study we used whole genome sequencing to characterize the clonal composition, virulence and resistance genetic determinants of 58 Staphylococcus/Mammaliicoccus spp. isolates from contralateral healthy skin and DFU from 44 hospitalized patients.
S. aureus (n = 32) and S. epidermidis (n = 10) isolates were recovered from both DFUs and healthy skin, whereas, S. haemolyticus (n = 8), M. sciuri (n = 1), S. hominis (n = 1) and S. simulans (n = 3) were recovered exclusively from healthy skin. In contrast, S. caprae (n = 2) and S. saprophyticus (n = 1) were recovered only from DFUs. Among S. aureus isolates, MRSA were present with high prevalence (27/32, 84.4%), 18 of which (66.7%) were from DFUs and 9 (33.3%) from healthy skin. In contrast, the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS)/Mammaliicoccus isolates (n = 26), in particular S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus were more prevalent in healthy skin, (10/26, 38.5%) and (8/26, 30.8%), respectively. MLST, spa and SCCmec typing classified the 32 S. aureus isolates into 6 STs, ST672, ST80, ST241, ST1, ST97, ST291 and 4 unknown STs (STNF); 8 spa types, t044, t037, t3841, t1247, t127, t639, t937 and t9432 and 2 SCCmec types, type IV and type III(A). Among CoNS, the S. epidermidis isolates belonged to ST54, ST35 and ST640. S. haemolyticus belonged to ST3, ST25, ST29, ST1 and ST56. The sole M. sciuri isolate was found to carry an SCCmec type III(A). A wide range of virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance genes were found among our isolates, with varying distribution between species or STs. The pan-genome analysis revealed a highly clonal population of Staphylococcus isolates, particularly among S. aureus isolates. Interestingly, the majority of S. aureus isolates including MRSA, recovered from the healthy skin and DFUs of the same patient belonged to the same clone and exhibited similar virulence/resistance genotype.
Our study provides clinically relevant information on the population profile, virulence and antibiotic resistance of Staphylococcus/Mammaliicoccus spp. in DFIs, which could serve as a basis for further studies on these as well as other groups of pathogens associated with DFIs.",type 2 diabetics
Circulating mir-199-3p screens the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the complication of coronary heart disease and predicts the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events.,"['RenjieRuan', 'YanweiLiu', 'XiangZhang']","Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which causes an adverse prognosis. There is an urgent need to explore effective biomarkers to evaluate the patients' adverse outcomes.
This study aimed to identify a novel indicator for screening T2DM and T2DM-CHD and predicting adverse prognosis.
The study enrolled 52 healthy individuals, 85 T2DM patients, and 97 T2DM patients combined with CHD. Serum miR-199-3p levels in all study subjects were detected with PCR, and its diagnostic significance was evaluated by receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis. The involvement of miR-199-3p in disease development was assessed by the Chi-square test, and the logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in T2DM-CHD patients.
Significant downregulation of miR-199-3p was observed in the serum of both T2DM and T2DM-CHD patients, which discriminated patients from healthy individuals and distinguished T2DM and T2DM-CHD patients. Reduced serum miR-199-3p was associated with the increasing blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) of T2DM patients and the increasing triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), fibrinogen, and total cholesterol (TC) and decreasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of T2DM-CHD patients. miR-199-3p was also identified as a biomarker predicting the occurrence of MACE.
Downregulated miR-199-3p could screen the onset of T2DM and its complication with CHD. Reduced serum miR-199-3p was associated with the severe development of T2DM and T2DM-CHD and predicted the adverse outcomes of T2DM-CHD patients.",type 2 diabetics

Cystic cells depend on glucose and are poorly able to use other energy sources such as ketone bodies. Raising ketone body concentration reduced disease progression in animal models of polycystic kidney diseases. Therefore, we hypothesized that higher endogenous plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations are associated with reduced disease progression in patients with ADPKD.
We analyzed data from 670 patients with ADPKD participating in the DIPAK cohort, a multi-center prospective observational cohort study. Beta-hydroxybutyrate was measured at baseline using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Participants were excluded if they had type 2 diabetes, were using disease-modifying drugs (e.g. tolvaptan, somatostatin analogs), were not fasting, or had missing beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, leaving 521 participants for the analyses. Linear regression analyses were used to study cross-sectional associations and linear mixed-effect modeling for longitudinal associations.
Of the participants, 61% were female, with an age of 47.3 ± 11.8 years, a height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV) of 834 (IQR 495-1327) ml/m, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 63.3 ± 28.9 mL/min/1.73m2. The median concentration of beta-hydroxybutyrate was 94 (IQR 68-147) µmol/L. Cross-sectionally, beta-hydroxybutyrate was neither associated with eGFR nor with htTKV. Longitudinally, beta-hydroxybutyrate was positively associated with eGFR slope (B = 0.35 ml/min/1.73m2 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.61), p = 0.007), but not with kidney growth. After adjustment for potential confounders, every doubling in beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration was associated with an improvement in the annual rate of eGFR by 0.33 ml/min/1.73m2 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.57, p = 0.008).
These observational analyses support the hypothesis that interventions that raise beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration could reduce the rate of kidney function decline in patients with ADPKD.",type 2 diabetics

Human skin explants from post-bariatric surgery are imaged in a micro-computed tomography scanner, with optimised parameters to reach one 3D image every 5 min during 3 h of 1UI/h infusion. Pressure inside the tubing is recorded. A new index of dispersion (IoD) is introduced and computed upon the segmented 3D insulin depot per time-step. Infusions were hypodermal in 58.3% among 24 assays, others being intradermal or extradermal. Several minor bubbles and one occlusion were observed. IoD increases with time for all injections. Inter-assay variability is the smallest for hypodermal infusions. Pressure elevations were observed, synchronised with air bubbles arrivals in the tissue.

Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussion with CHWs (n=4); semi-structured interviews with clinicians (n=17). Interpretivist approach to explain CHWs' adaptations using a mix of inductive and deductive analysis.
CHWs' adaptations extended the intervention in three ways: by extending social assistance, healthcare access, and operational tasks. The adaptations were intended to improve fit, reach, and retention, but likely had ripple effects on implementation outcomes. CHWs' focus on patients' complex social needs could divert them from judiciously managing their caseload.
CHWs' community knowledge can support patient engagement, but overextension of social assistance may detract from protocolized health-coaching goals. CHW programs in primary care should explicitly delineate CHWs' non-health support to patients, include multiprofessional teams or partnerships with community-based organizations, establish formal communication between CHWs and clinicians, and institute mechanisms to review and iterate CHWs' work to resolve challenges in their community-oriented role.",type 2 diabetics

Considering the rapid adoption of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study examined associations between telehealth use and healthcare utilization among Medicaid beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes.
Using Louisiana Medicaid claims data from March 2019 to August 2021, the associations were examined using a difference-in-difference model with propensity score weighting. Demographic characteristics, baseline comorbidities and healthcare utilization, and zip code level environmental factors were included in the analysis. The monthly frequency of healthcare services, including in-person outpatient visits, inpatient visits, emergency department (ED) visits and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) tests, were measured as outcomes. Several sensitivity analyses were conducted across different subgroups.
We included 48,992 beneficiaries with type 2 diabetes in the study of 27,340 beneficiaries in the telehealth group and 21,652 beneficiaries in the non-telehealth group. Of 1000 beneficiaries per month, the telehealth group had significantly more utilization compared to the non-telehealth group, with an increase of 195.049 in-person outpatient visits (95% CI: 166.169 to 223.929, p < 0.001), 3.816 inpatient visits (95% CI: 2.539 to 5.093, p < 0.001), 10.499 ED visits (95% CI: 7.287 to 13.712, p < 0.001) and 14.153 HbA1c tests (95% CI: 11.431 to 16.875, p < 0.001, respectively.

A cross-sectional study.
Yuhuan City, Zhejiang Province, China.
A total of 803 patients with diabetes were invited to attend a questionnaire survey and 782 patients with type 2 diabetes completed the survey. The average age of participants was 58.47 years old, 48.21% of whom only attended primary school or below.
A questionnaire based on existing scales and expert consultation was applied to assess patients' socio-demographic information (SI), disease progression risk and diabetes-related KAP. A structural equation model was built to analyse the relationships between patients' characteristics and KAP.
No significant association was found between patients' knowledge and attitude (β=0.01, p=0.43). Better knowledge and attitude were both found to be associated with better diet and physical activities (β=0.58, p<0.001; β=0.46, p=0.01). However, patients with a more positive attitude toward diabetic care showed worse foot care practice (β=-0.13, p=0.02), while better knowledge was associated with better foot care practice (β=0.29, p<0.001). In addition, patients with higher SI (β=0.88, p<0.001) and/or disease progression risk (β=0.42, p<0.001) tended to present higher levels of disease knowledge.
While successful KAP transformation has been achieved in practice for diet and physical activities, there is a need to improve foot care practice. Health education should also prioritise the prevention, detection and care of diabetic foot. Also, appropriate methods should be adopted to deliver health education to vulnerable patients, such as the elderly, those living in rural areas, those with minimal education, the unemployed and low-income patients.",type 2 diabetics

Saxagliptin has been approved by the FDA for diabetes treatment. However, the detailed in vivo effects of prolonged saxagliptin treatment on chromosomal instability have not yet been reported. In this study, streptozotocin was used to induce diabetes in mice, and both diabetic and non-diabetic mice received saxagliptin for five weeks. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was conducted in combination with a bone marrow micronucleus test for measuring chromosomal instability. Our results indicated that saxagliptin is neither mutagenic nor cytotoxic, under the given treatment regimen. Diabetic mice had a much higher incidence of micronuclei formation, and a centromeric DNA probe was present inside the majority of the induced micronuclei, indicating that most of these were caused by chromosome nondisjunction. Conversely, diabetic mice treated with saxagliptin exhibited a significant decrease in micronuclei induction, which were centromeric-positive and centromeric-negative. Diabetes also causes significant biochemical changes indicative of oxidative stress, such as increased lipid peroxidation and decreased reduced/oxidized glutathione ratio, which was reversed by saxagliptin administration. Overall, saxagliptin, the non-mutagenic antidiabetic drug, maintains chromosomal integrity in diabetes and reduces micronuclei formation by restoring redox imbalance, further indicating its usefulness in diabetic patients.",type 2 diabetics
Consolidating evidence on the role of insulin resistance in major depressive disorder.,"['Anna JuliaKrupa', 'DominikaDudek', 'MarcinSiwek']","The circular interactions between type 2 diabetes (TMD2) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are well documented but the understanding of their mechanisms has only recently gained more clarity. Latest research indicates, that the association between TMD2 and MDD is largely mediated by insulin resistance (IR).
A metabolic subtype of MDD can be distinguished from other MDD subpopulations, that is characterized by predominantly atypical clinical presentation, IR and different responsiveness to antidepressant interventions. IR is a predictor of nonresponse to some antidepressants. The IR seems to be a state-marker of clinical or subclinical depression and the relationship between IR and MDD varies between sexes and ethnicities. Insulin has a direct impact on the monoaminergic systems known to underlie MDD symptoms: serotoninergic and dopaminergic, which are dysregulated in IR subjects. Several trials assessed the efficacy of insulin-sensitizing drugs in MDD with mixed results for metformin and more consistent evidence for pioglitazone and lifestyle intervention/physical activity.
Recently published data suggest a significant role of IR in the clinical presentation, pathophysiology and treatment response in MDD. Further research of IR in MDD and integration of existing data into clinical practice are needed.",type 2 diabetics
Association of Diabetic Macular Edema with Quality of Life in Type 2 diabetes patients: The Fushun Diabetic Retinopathy Cohort Study.,"['BoZang', 'ShisongRong', 'YuWang', 'KemiFeng', 'XiaoxiaDing', 'LiangWen', 'DongxiaoZang', 'DongLi', 'YuanboLiang', 'FenghuaWang', 'GangZhai']","To report the vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) in a population-based study.
In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed 1659 subjects with type 2 diabetes. Questionnaires were administered to assess the patient's VRQoL. DME severity was graded according to established protocols. A subject's DME score ranged from 1 (no DME in either eye) to 7 (severe bilateral DME) using predefined criteria.
Composite NEI-VFQ-25 scores for participants with DME were 88.9 (interquartile range [IQR]: 76.2, 94.9), compared to 92.0 (IQR: 82.7, 96.0) for those without DME (P < 0.001). Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) plots depicted a consistent decline in composite NEI-VFQ-25 scores corresponding to the escalation of bilateral DME severity: starting from 88.59 for no DME in either eye, progressing through 86.65, 85.83, 85.31, 84.91, 83.85, and culminating at 82.71 for bilateral severe DME. Notably, the LOWESS plots highlighted significant NEI-VFQ-25 composite score reduction at unilateral mild DME (slope m= -1.94).
Significant changes in VRQoL manifest in the early stage of DME. Therefore, early identification and intervention for these patients are crucial clinical objectives.",type 2 diabetics

We assessed the prognostic value of TNF-related biomarkers for CKD progression in Japanese patients with diabetes.
We estimated TNF-related biomarkers using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 640 patients with diabetes. Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) per one standard deviation (SD) increase in a log-transformed biomarker. The kidney and the composite outcome were defined as a 30% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline, and kidney outcome plus death before kidney outcome, respectively.
During the median follow-up of 5.4 years, 75 (11.7%) patients reached the kidney outcome and 37 (5.8%) died before reaching the kidney outcome. Each SD increase in baseline circulating TNFR1, TNFR2, and ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EphA2) was associated with a higher risk of the kidney outcome independently from baseline eGFR and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. However, circulating osteoprotegerin was associated with the composite outcome only.

Impact of moderate-to-late preterm birth on neurodevelopmental outcomes in young children: Results from retrospective longitudinal follow-up with nationally representative data.,"['SangmiLee', 'YuriHan', 'Min KyungLim', 'Hun JaeLee']","This study investigated the relationship between moderate-to-late preterm (MLPT) birth and the risk of neurodevelopmental impairments (NIs) in young children compared with the risks associated with very preterm (VPT) and full-term (FT) birth based on nationally representative large-scale population data. Retrospective follow-up was conducted over 71 months for 738,733 children who were born and participated in the Korean National Health Screening Program for Infants and Children (NHSPIC) between 2011 and 2013. Using a data linkage between the NHSPIC and Korean healthcare claim information, data on birth year, sex, delivery type, birth weight, growth abnormality, gestational age, breastfeeding history, maternal age, NIs, multiple gestation, preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes (PROM), gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, smoking during pregnancy, and socioeconomic status were collected and included in the final analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to identify the impact of gestational age on NI risk, with all variables adjusted as appropriate. Overall, 0.9% and 3.8% rates of VPT and MLPT births were identified, respectively. NI incidence was highest among VPT children (34.7%), followed by MLPT (23.9%) and FT (18.2%) children. Both VPT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 2.05) and MLPT (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.41) births were associated with increased NI risk. Low birth weight, PROM, and smoking during pregnancy were also associated with increased NI risk, while longer breastfeeding and higher socioeconomic status were associated with decreased risk.

Psycho-social factors associated with type two diabetes remission through lifestyle intervention: A scoping review.,"['Kathy JHart', 'AndrewKubilius', 'MartinClark']","There is growing evidence that type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be put into remission through lifestyle intervention. Current focus on remission in terms of physiological considerations and biomedical scales, means there is limited understanding of the role psycho-social factors play in moderating the efficacy of lifestyle interventions for T2D remission. In the current review we aimed to synthesise the emerging literature on psycho-social factors associated with T2D remission, specifically from lifestyle interventions.
Five databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL ultimate, PsychINFO and PsycArticles) were searched to identify studies from 2009 onwards that reported remission outcomes from lifestyle interventions in participants ≥ 18years old, with a clinical diagnosis of T2D. Studies included were of an interventional or observational design and restricted to English language. Screening and data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers using prespecified criteria.
In total 6106 studies were screened, 36 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included. Studies were globally diverse, with 30 (83%) being published ≥ 2017. Psycho-social scales were under-utilised with 22 (67%) of studies failing to include any psycho-social measures. Single arm, prospective studies were most frequently utilised, however study quality was perceived to be heterogeneous. Further disparity in the quality, content and delineation of the psycho-social interventions was also identified. Education and self-monitoring interventions were the most frequently incorporated. Self-monitoring was also identified as an important facilitator to remission, in addition to social support.
Our findings indicate that psycho-social factors in T2D remission are under-explored. We have identified a number of methodological issues (comparability, conflicting remission criteria and poorly defined psycho-social interventions) suggesting knowledge gaps which could inform the methodology of future research design. There is significant opportunity for future research to incorporate the social model of disease, conceptualise remission more holistically, and build a more comprehensive evidence base to guide clinical practice.",type 2 diabetics
"Patents and regulatory exclusivities on FDA-approved insulin products: A longitudinal database study, 1986-2019.","['AndersOlsen', 'Reed FBeall', 'Ryan PKnox', 'Sean STu', 'Aaron SKesselheim', 'William BFeldman']","Insulin is the primary treatment for type 1 and some type 2 diabetes but remains costly in the United States, even though it was discovered more than a century ago. High prices can lead to nonadherence and are often sustained by patents and regulatory exclusivities that limit competition on brand-name products. We sought to examine how manufacturers have used patents and regulatory exclusivities on insulin products approved from 1986 to 2019 to extend periods of market exclusivity.
We used the publicly available Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book) to identify all approved biosynthetic insulin products. Individual products approved under the same New Drug Application (NDA)-e.g., a vial and pen-were considered as separate products for the purposes of analysis. We recorded all patents and regulatory exclusivities listed in the Orange Book on each product and used Google Patents to extract the timing of patent application and whether patents were obtained on delivery devices or others aspects of the product. The primary outcome was the duration of expected protection, which was determined by subtracting the FDA approval date for each product from its last-to-expire patent or regulatory exclusivity (whichever occurred later). We performed a secondary analysis that considered overall protection on insulin lines-defined as groups of products approved under the same NDA with the same active ingredients manufactured by the same company. We also examined competition from follow-on insulin products-defined as products approved with the same active ingredients as originators but manufactured by different companies (approved via a specific drug approval pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). During the study period, the FDA approved 56 individual products across 25 different insulin lines and 5 follow-ons across 3 different insulin lines. Thirty-three (59%) of the 56 products were drug-device combinations. Manufacturers of 9 products approved during the study period obtained patents filed after FDA approval that extended their duration of expected protection (by a median of 6 years). Approximately 63% of all patents on drug-device combinations approved during the study period were related to delivery devices. The median duration of expected protection on insulin products was 16.0 years, and the median protection on insulin lines was 17.6 years. An important limitation of our analysis is that manufacturers may continue to add patents on existing insulin products while competitors may challenge patents; therefore, periods of protection may change over time.
Among several strategies that insulin manufacturers have employed to extend periods of market exclusivity on brand-name insulin products are filing patents after FDA approval and obtaining a large number of patents on delivery devices. Policy reforms are needed to promote timely competition in the pharmaceutical market and ensure that patients have access to low-cost drugs.",type 2 diabetics
Postprandial Metabolite Profiles and Risk of Prediabetes in Young People: A Longitudinal Multicohort Study.,"['Jesse AGoodrich', 'HongxuWang', 'Douglas IWalker', 'XiangpingLin', 'XinHu', 'Tanya LAlderete', 'ZhanghuaChen', 'DamaskiniValvi', 'Brittney OBaumert', 'SarahRock', 'KirosBerhane', 'Frank DGilliland', 'Michael IGoran', 'Dean PJones', 'David VConti', 'LedaChatzi']","Prediabetes in young people is an emerging epidemic that disproportionately impacts Hispanic populations. We aimed to develop a metabolite-based prediction model for prediabetes in young people with overweight/obesity at risk for type 2 diabetes.
In independent, prospective cohorts of Hispanic youth (discovery; n = 143 without baseline prediabetes) and predominately Hispanic young adults (validation; n = 56 without baseline prediabetes), we assessed prediabetes via 2-h oral glucose tolerance tests. Baseline metabolite levels were measured in plasma from a 2-h postglucose challenge. In the discovery cohort, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression with a stability selection procedure was used to identify robust predictive metabolites for prediabetes. Predictive performance was evaluated in the discovery and validation cohorts using logistic regression.
Two metabolites (allylphenol sulfate and caprylic acid) were found to predict prediabetes beyond known risk factors, including sex, BMI, age, ethnicity, fasting/2-h glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides. In the discovery cohort, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of the model with metabolites and known risk factors was 0.80 (95% CI 0.72-0.87), which was higher than the risk factor-only model (AUC 0.63 [0.53-0.73]; P = 0.001). When the predictive models developed in the discovery cohort were applied to the replication cohort, the model with metabolites and risk factors predicted prediabetes more accurately (AUC 0.70 [95% CI 40.55-0.86]) than the same model without metabolites (AUC 0.62 [0.46-0.79]).
Metabolite profiles may help improve prediabetes prediction compared with traditional risk factors. Findings suggest that medium-chain fatty acids and phytochemicals are early indicators of prediabetes in high-risk youth.",type 2 diabetics
Social Determinants of Health and Perceived Barriers to Care in Diabetic Retinopathy Screening.,"['RohithRavindranath', 'Isaac ABernstein', 'Karen SFernandez', 'Cassie ALudwig', 'Sophia YWang']","Regular screening for diabetic retinopathy often is crucial for the health of patients with diabetes. However, many factors may be barriers to regular screening and associated with disparities in screening rates.
To evaluate the associations between visiting an eye care practitioner for diabetic retinopathy screening and factors related to overall health and social determinants of health, including socioeconomic status and health care access and utilization.
This retrospective cross-sectional study included adults aged 18 years or older with type 2 diabetes who answered survey questions in the All of Us Research Program, a national multicenter cohort of patients contributing electronic health records and survey data, who were enrolled from May 1, 2018, to July 1, 2022.
The associations between visiting an eye care practitioner and (1) demographic and socioeconomic factors and (2) responses to the Health Care Access and Utilization, Social Determinants of Health, and Overall Health surveys were investigated using univariable and multivariable logistic regressions.
The primary outcome was whether patients self-reported visiting an eye care practitioner in the past 12 months. The associations between visiting an eye care practitioner and demographic and socioeconomic factors and responses to the Health Care Access and Utilization, Social Determinants of Health, and Overall Health surveys in All of Us were investigated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression.
Of the 11 551 included participants (54.55% cisgender women; mean [SD] age, 64.71 [11.82] years), 7983 (69.11%) self-reported visiting an eye care practitioner in the past year. Individuals who thought practitioner concordance was somewhat or very important were less likely to have seen an eye care practitioner (somewhat important: adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.93]; very important: AOR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.76-0.95]). Compared with financially stable participants, individuals with food or housing insecurity were less likely to visit an eye care practitioner (food insecurity: AOR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.91]; housing insecurity: AOR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.98]). Individuals who reported fair mental health were less likely to visit an eye care practitioner than were those who reported good mental health (AOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.96).
This study found that food insecurity, housing insecurity, mental health concerns, and the perceived importance of practitioner concordance were associated with a lower likelihood of receiving eye care. Such findings highlight the self-reported barriers to seeking care and the importance of taking steps to promote health equity.",type 2 diabetics

This observational study included 80 patients with HFpEF; 40 of them received atorvastatin 20-80 mg/day in addition to a standard treatment. 40 patient who refused of the statin treatment or had intolerance of the drug received only the standard treatment. The follow-up period was 12 months and included 5 visits. At the visits, the general condition of patients was evaluated; electrocardiography and echocardiography were performed at rest and during dosed physical exercise (PE); anthropometry was analyzed; and office blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and parameters of systolic and diastolic LV function were recorded.
Among the patients included into the study, women aged 60-70 years prevailed who had pronounced obesity (n=46; 57.5% with class II-II obesity), severe arterial hypertension (AH) (n=65; 81.2% with grade 3 hypertension), dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. The administration of atorvastatin in addition to standard therapy was associated with regression of HF symptoms and increased PE tolerance; these effects were more pronounced after 6 months of observation. Furthermore, during a 12-month follow-up, significant multidirectional changes in LV global longitudinal strain were noted; in the main group, the LV global longitudinal strain increased indicating an improvement in the LV systolic function while in the control group, it decreased reflecting early, preclinical manifestations of HF progression. A diastolic stress test in combination with a cardiopulmonary stress test was performed in 64 patients with HFpEF at enrollment and at 6 and 12 months of follow-up. When the load reached 50 W in the atorvastatin treatment group after 12 months, a significant increase in tissue Doppler velocity parameters was revealed, specifically in e' septal and e' lateral. This led to a significant decrease in the E / e' ratio while in the control group, no time-related changes in these parameters were noted. Similar changes were also detected at higher levels of PE.

Hepatoprotective effects of gentisic acid through its anti-oxidant properties in nicotinamide-streptozotocin induced diabetic mice.,"['RezaNoei Razliqi', 'ElnazHarooni', 'NiloofarNeisi', 'MaryamJafar Sameri', 'AkramAhangarpour']","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common metabolic disorder that causes many complications. Liver failure is one of the complications of T2DM. Oxidative stress plays a major role in the development and progression of T2DM-induced liver injury. Gentisic acid (GA) is a metabolite of aspirin and also a phenolic compound found in natural sources that is a highly effective antioxidant and free radical scavenger. So, in this study, the potential preventive benefits of GA against liver damage induced by T2DM were explored.
This study was conducted on 24 adult male mice. T2DM was induced by intraperitoneal injection of a single dose of streptozotocin (at a dose of 65 mg/kg), 15 min after the injection of nicotinamide (at a dose of 120 mg/kg). The grouping was as follows: 1) Normal Control Group; 2) Diabetic Control Group; 3) Positive Control Group: received metformin (150 mg/kg body weight daily) through gavage; 4) Treatment Group: received GA at the dose of 100 mg/kg body weight daily through gavage. Treatments continued for two weeks.
Two weeks of GA treatment in diabetic mice reduced fasting blood glucose, improved plasma levels of hepatic enzymes, and increased liver tissue antioxidant capacity. Histopathological examination revealed that GA administration reduced diabetes-induced liver damage. Furthermore, GA treatment led to the down-regulation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and up-regulation of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2).

The odds of medication adherence increased with higher age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8 [1.1-2.9]) and more duration of illness (OR = 1.8 [1.0-3.2]) Patients having good knowledge of diabetes were more likely to adhere to medications. [OR=1.8(1.1-3.1). Diabetes medicine-adherent patients had a higher perceived understanding of the disease, felt having lesser negative consequences, and were less concerned about the illness than their counterparts. A high proportion adhered to diabetes medication. The guiding factors to further improve medication adherence are age, duration of illness, illness perception, and knowledge regarding the disease.",type 2 diabetics
Effectiveness of Diabetes Self-Management Education on Distress and HbA1C among Indian Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"['MAnjali', 'MeenakshiKhapre', 'RaviKant', 'SantoshKumar', 'PragyaPandey']","The interrelationship of diabetes with mental illness has increased in recent years. Diabetes-related distress is the emotional burden, stress, and worries associated with diabetes, which does not reach the threshold for depressive disorder. A diabetes self-management education (DSME) is a structured educational approach to improve glycemic control and diabetes-related distress. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of DSME in comparison with usual diabetes care in improving glycemic control and diabetes-related distress.
This is a single-center, parallel randomized controlled trial. A total of 106 participants were recruited for both intervention and control groups with 53 participants each. The control group received only routine outpatient department (OPD) care. The intervention group received DSME in addition to routine OPD care. Diabetes-related distress and HbA1C were assessed after 3 months. The data were analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25. Per-protocol analysis was done.
Of 127 patients screened, 106 met the eligibility criteria and were randomized. At 3-month follow-up, the reduction in mean HbA1C, fasting blood sugar (FBS), postprandial blood sugar (PPBS), and diabetes distress were significant in the intervention group compared with the control group (p 0.001). The mean HbA1C reduction in the intervention group was significant (mean difference: -1.3, SD: 0.4). The mean DDS had decreased significantly in the intervention group from 2 to 1.2 (mean difference: -0.8, SD: 0.1).
The DSME was effective in improving the glycemic control, diabetes-related distress, and self-care among type 2 diabetes (T2DM) mellitus patients.",type 2 diabetics
Characteristics of glucose change in diabetes mellitus generalized through continuous wavelet transform processing: A preliminary study.,"['YoichiNakamura', 'ShinyaFurukawa']","The continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system has become a popular evaluation tool for glucose fluctuation, providing a detailed description of glucose change patterns. We hypothesized that glucose fluctuations may contain specific information on differences in glucose change between type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), despite similarities in change patterns, because of different etiologies. Unlike Fourier transform, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is able to simultaneously analyze the time and fre-quency domains of oscillating data.
To investigate whether CWT can detect glucose fluctuations in T1DM.

We included 93 RCTs that compared TZD with placebo and one that compared chiglitazar with placebo. For efficacy endpoints, the augmented dose of chig-litazar resulted in greater reductions in hemoglobin (Hb)A1c [weighted mean difference (WMD) = -0.15%, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.27 to -0.04%], triglycerides (WMD = -0.17 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.24 to -0.11 mmol/L) and alanine aminotransferase (WMD = -5.25 U/L, 95%CI: -8.50 to -1.99 U/L), and a greater increase in homeostasis model assessment-β (HOMA-β) (WMD = 17.75, 95%CI: 10.73-24.77) when compared with TZD treatment. For safety endpoints, the risks of hypoglycemia, edema, bone fractures, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and weight gain were all comparable between the augmented dose of chiglitazar and TZD. In patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 8.5%, body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m

Gut microbiome supplementation as therapy for metabolic syndrome.,"['Mc AntoAntony', 'AniqaChowdhury', 'DineshEdem', 'RishiRaj', 'PriyanshuNain', 'MansiJoglekar', 'VipinVerma', 'RaviKant']","The gut microbiome is defined as an ecological community of commensal symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that exist in our body. Gut microbiome dysbiosis is a condition of dysregulated and disrupted intestinal bacterial homeostasis, and recent evidence has shown that dysbiosis is related to chronic inflammation, insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and obesity. It is well known that obesity, T2DM and CVD are caused or worsened by multiple factors like genetic predisposition, environmental factors, unhealthy high calorie diets, and sedentary lifestyle. However, recent evidence from human and mouse models suggest that the gut microbiome is also an active player in the modulation of metabolic syndrome, a set of risk factors including obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia that increase the risk for CVD, T2DM, and other diseases. Current research aims to identify treatments to increase the number of beneficial microbiota in the gut microbiome in order to modulate metabolic syndrome by reducing chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. There is increasing interest in supplements, classified as prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, or postbiotics, and their effect on the gut microbiome and metabolic syndrome. In this review article, we have summarized current research on these supplements that are available to improve the abundance of beneficial gut microbiota and to reduce the harmful ones in patients with metabolic syndrome.",type 2 diabetics

To explore the interaction between body weight and the factors affecting the progression of prediabetes to T2DM.
We performed a retrospective analysis of 236 patients with prediabetes and 50 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), and collected clinical data and follow-up results of all patients. Based on natural blood glucose outcomes, we classified 66 patients with progression to T2DM into the disease progression (DP) group, and 170 patients without progression to T2DM into the disease outcome (DO) group. We analyzed the factors that influenced prediabetes outcome and the influence of body weight on prediabetes blood glucose outcome by unconditional logistic regression. A general linear model (univariate) was used to analyze the inter-action between body weight and independent influencing factors.
There were 98 cases of impaired fasting glucose (IFG), 90 cases of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 48 cases of coexistent IFG and IGT.

In contrast to efforts to date that are limited to static functional connectivity, here we investigate abnormal connectivity in T2DM individuals by characterizing the time-varying properties of brain functional networks. Using group independent component analysis (GICA), sliding-window analysis, and k-means clustering, we extracted thirty-one intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) and estimated four recurring brain states. We observed significant group differences in fraction time (FT) and mean dwell time (MDT), and significant negative correlation between the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores and FT/MDT. We found that in the T2DM group the inter- and intra-network connectivity decreases and increases respectively for the default mode network (DMN) and task-positive network (TPN). We also found alteration in the precuneus network (PCUN) and enhanced connectivity between the salience network (SN) and the TPN.

Epalrestat is effective in treating diabetic foot infection and can lower serum inflammatory factors in patients.,"['YanXu', 'XiaohuFu', 'FuyingChen']","This study was designed to determine the efficacy of epalrestat on patients with diabetic foot infection (DFI) and its effects on serum inflammatory factors in the patients.
The data of 80 patients with DFI treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi Medical College from May 2020 to May 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. Among them, patients who received routine comprehensive treatment were enrolled into the control group (n=37), and those who received epalrestat on the basis of routine comprehensive treatment were enrolled into the study group (n=43). The changes of serum inflammatory factors before and after treatment, granulation tissue grading and efficacy in the two groups were analyzed and compared, and the wound healing time, hospitalization time and adverse reactions (including nausea and vomiting, dizziness, headache, pruritus, etc.) of the two groups were statistically analyzed. The prognosis of the patients within 1 year after treatment was analyzed, and the independent risk factors of poor prognosis were analyzed through logistic regression.
Before treatment, the two groups were not significantly different in the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), while after treatment, the levels decreased significantly in both groups, with significantly lower levels in the study group than those in the control group. The study group had a significant lower proportion of patients with grade 0/grade 1 granulation tissue than the control group, and had a significantly higher proportion of patients with grade 2/grade 4 granulation tissue than the control group, but the proportion of patients with grade 3 granulation tissue in the two groups was not greatly different. The study group experienced notably shorter wound healing time and hospitalization time than the control group. A notably higher overall response rate was found in the study group than that in the control group. In addition, the total incidence of adverse reactions was not greatly different between the two groups. BMI, diabetes mellitus type, Wagner grading and classification of diabetic foot infection were found to be the risk factors affecting the prognosis of patients, and Wagner grading was an independent risk factor affecting the prognosis of patients.
Epalrestat is effective in treating DFI, because it can lower the levels of serum inflammatory factors, shorten the time of wound healing and hospitalization, and promote the growth and recovery of granulation, without increasing adverse reactions. Therefore, it is worthy of clinical promotion.",type 2 diabetics
"Adolescent with Diabetic Ketoacidosis, Hypothermia and Pneumomediastinum.","['StevenMillner', 'CourtneyDevlin']","The target audience of this simulation is emergency medicine residents and medical students. The simulation is based on a real case of a 12-year-old male who presented obtunded with shortness of breath and hypothermia who was ultimately diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and pneumomediastinum. This case highlights the diagnosis and management of an adolescent with new onset diabetic ketoacidosis and pneumomediastinum with deterioration of status, as well as important ventilator settings if intubation is required in the setting of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Type 1 diabetes is a common disease in the pediatric population with the prevalence being approximately 2.15 per 1000 youths and diabetic ketoacidosis being the presenting status in 30-40% of the patients.1 Physicians who evaluate a child with altered mental status must have diabetic ketoacidosis in their differential. In the setting of mechanical ventilation in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), special care must be taken. Mechanical ventilation in these patients comes with increased risk, morbidity, and mortality. Risk factors for pneumomediastinum include lung disease such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and malignancy, but also can occur in the acute setting of vomiting or trauma.2.
By the end of the simulation, learners will be able to: 1) develop a differential diagnosis for an adolescent who presents obtunded with shortness of breath; 2) discuss the management of diabetic ketoacidosis; 3) discuss management of hypothermia in a pediatric patient; 4) discuss appropriate ventilator settings in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis; and 5) demonstrate interpersonal communication with family, nursing, and consultants during high stress situations.
This is a high-fidelity simulation that allows learners to manage the diagnosis and treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis and hypothermia in an adolescent patient. Participants participated in a debriefing after the simulation. There should be approximately 4-5 learners per case. This simulation was performed in 3 sessions. Each learner performed this simulation one time.
The effectiveness of this case was evaluated by surveys given to learners after debriefing. Learners gave quantitative and qualitative results of their feedback using a 1-5 rating scale and open-ended written questions. This case was trialed with residents in their first through third years of training as well as fourth year medical students.
Feedback was very positive, with 19 residents completing the post-simulation survey. They enjoyed the case and reported they would feel more comfortable in a comparable situation in the future. Four survey questions were asked of the participants. On average, learners stated they felt the simulation improved their ability to manage a pediatric DKA patient, and their knowledge of complications and appropriate ventilator settings improved (modes of 5, 4 and 5, respectively).
Diabetic ketoacidosis is a common and critical diagnosis for emergency medicine physicians to consider in the setting of altered mental status in a pediatric patient. This simulation has multiple steps and is based on a real case of an obtunded and hypothermic pediatric patient who was ultimately diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis complicated by pneumomediastinum.

Evolution of GCGR family ligand‒receptor extensive cross-interaction systems suggests a therapeutic direction for hyperglycemia in mammals.,"['JianLiu', 'XueWang', 'WenLiZhang', 'GuangnengLiao', 'ZhenhuaShao', 'JuergenBrosius', 'ChengDeng', 'ShanshanLai', 'EnwuLong']","Glucose is essential to the physiological processes of vertebrates. Mammalian physiological stability requires a relatively stable blood glucose level (~5 mmol/L), whereas other vertebrates have greater flexibility in regulating blood glucose (0.5-25 mmol/L). GCGR family receptors play an important role in vertebrate glucose regulation. Here, we examine the evolution of the GCGR family ligand‒receptor systems in different species. Comparatively, we discover that the conserved sequences among GCG family ligands lead to the non-specific activation of ligands across species. In particular, we observe that glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R), glucagon-like peptide 2 receptor (GLP2R), and glucagon-like receptor (GCGLR, also called GCRPR) are arbitrarily activated by other members of the ligand family in birds.

[Neuroendocrine features of the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (literature review)].,"['Yu SAbsatarova', 'Yu SEvseeva', 'E NAndreeva']","Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most pressing problems in endocrine gynecology. The main signs of the disease are hyperandrogenism, menstrual and/or ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian structure according to ultrasound. Women with PCOS are at risk for developing metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and endometrial cancer. In this connection, the pathogenetic mechanisms of the occurrence of this syndrome are continuously studied and new methods of treatment are being sought. PCOS is characterized by a wide range of various disorders of the neuroendocrine regulation of the reproductive system. The main focus of the review is aimed at summarizing information about the etiological role of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, such as phoenixin, galanins, orexins, GABA, in the pathophysiology of PCOS and about the possibility of their use for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In recent decades, the interest of scientists has been focused on the study of KNDy neurons, because it is the kisspeptin synthesized by them that is one of the main regulators of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. This article discusses data on the significance of KNDy neurons in the pathogenesis of the syndrome. Information is provided on the effect of elevated levels of androgens and anti-Müllerian hormone on GnRH neurons. Also analyzed are studies on functional and structural disorders in the hypothalamus in PCOS. Literature search was carried out in national (eLibrary, CyberLeninka.ru) and international (PubMed, Cochrane Library) databases in Russian and English. The priority was free access to the full text of articles. The choice of sources was prioritized for the period from 2018 to 2023.However, taking into account the insufficient knowledge of the chosen topic, the choice of sources dates back to 1998.",type 2 diabetics

Now they are studying the possibility of a new stratification of diabetes. The possibility of cluster analysis for different durations of diabetes, in different cohorts to identify phenotypic clusters of T2DM and validation by reproducing clusters is relevant.
Identify clusters of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with different disease duration based on five variables: HbA1c, age at diagnosis, BMI, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B and study the clinical features and complication rates in each cluster in the Novosibirsk region.
Cluster analysis of K-means was performed in 2131 patients with T2DM, aged 44 to 70 years, with a duration of diabetes of 6.42±5.66 years, living in the Novosibirsk region based on 5 variables - HbA1c, age at -diagnosis, BMI, HOMA-IR, HOMA-B. All patients a complete clinical and laboratory examination. The insulin resistance index in the HOMA (HOMA-IR, u) and the β-cell function assessment index (HOMA-B) were calculated using the calculator -version 2.2.3 at www.dtu.ox.ac.uk.
Cluster analysis revealed: Cluster 1 included 455 patients with preserved β-cell function (HOMA-B 82.97±23.28%), moderate insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 5.57±4.72) and higher diastolic BP; Cluster 2 in 1658 patients with reduced function of β-cells (HOMA-B 21.71±12.51%), the lowest indices of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 3.50±2.48) and was characterized by a longer duration of diabetes, high fasting glycemia , HbA1c, higher eGFR and MAU, men compared with women had a 31% higher risk of developing diabetic neuropathy and 28% more diabetic nephropathy; Cluster 3 in 18 patients with high function of β-cells (HOMA-B 228.53±63.32%), severe insulin resistance (HOMA-IR 6.92±4.77), features were high incidence of men, shorter duration of diabetes, lower fasting glycemia and HbA1c, lower diastolic BP and eGFR, high incidence of early development of diabetic retinopathy after 4.00±3.6 years.
Cluster analysis in patients with different durations of diabetes mellitus confirmed the possibility of using cluster analysis to identify T2DM phenotypes in the Russian population. The clusters differed in the clinical characteristics of patients, the frequency and risk of diabetic complications.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of antidiabetic drugs in the treatment of AD. According to the results of the study, metformin, intranasal insulin, thiazolidinediones and incretins showed a positive effect both in humans and in animal models. Recent studies show that thiazolidinediones can activate pathways in the brain that are regulated by IGF-1; however, rosiglitazone may pose a significant risk of side effects.

Insulin independence following islet transplantation improves long-term metabolic outcomes.,"['Adam KStanley', 'KirstyDuncan', 'DebbieAnderson', 'LoraIrvine', 'AndrewSutherland', 'ShareenForbes', 'JohnCasey']","Pancreatic islet allotransplantation is an effective therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus, restoring glycaemic control and hypoglycaemic awareness in patients with recurrent severe hypoglycaemia. Insulin independence following transplant is being increasingly reported; however, this is not a primary endpoint in the UK. Having surpassed 10 years of islet transplantation in Scotland, we aimed to evaluate the impact of insulin independence following transplant on metabolic outcomes and graft survival.
We conducted a retrospective analysis on data collected prospectively between 2011 and 2022. Patients who underwent islet transplantation in Scotland up to the 31st January 2020 were included. Primary endpoint was graft survival (stimulated C-peptide >50 pmol/L). Secondary endpoints included GOLD score, HbA1c, C-peptide and insulin requirement. Outcomes were compared between patients who achieved insulin independence at any point following transplant versus those who did not.
60 patients were included. 74.5% experienced >50 severe hypoglycaemic episodes in the year preceding transplant. There was a 55.0% decrease in insulin requirement following transplant and 30.0% achieved insulin independence. Mean graft survival time was 9.0 years (95% CI 7.2-10.9) in patients who achieved insulin independence versus 4.4 years (95% CI 3.4-5.3) in patients who did not. Insulin independence was associated with significantly improved graft function, glycaemic control and hypoglycaemic awareness at 1 year.

Association between ultra-processed food consumption and the incidence of type 2 diabetes: the ELSA-Brasil cohort.,"['Scheine LCanhada', 'ÁlvaroVigo', 'RenataLevy', 'Vivian CLuft', 'Maria de Jesus Mda Fonseca', 'LuanaGiatti', 'Maria Del Carmen BMolina', 'Bruce BDuncan', 'Maria InêsSchmidt']","Ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption increases the risk of type 2 diabetes in various high-income countries, with some variation in the magnitude across studies. Our objective was to investigate the association of UPF consumption and specific subgroups with incident type 2 diabetes in Brazilian adults.
The Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) is a multicenter cohort study of 15,105 adults (35-74 years) enrolled in public institutions in Brazil (2008-2010). We followed participants with two clinic visits (2012-2014; 2017-2019) and annual telephone surveillance. After excluding those with diabetes at baseline, who died or were lost in the follow-up, with missing data, with implausible energy food intake, or reporting bariatric surgery, there were 10,202 participants. We used the NOVA classification to assess UPF consumption based on a food frequency questionnaire. We defined type 2 diabetes by self-report, medication use, or comprehensive laboratory tests. We estimated relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using robust Poisson regression.
Median UPF consumption was 372 g/day. Over 8.2 (0.7) years of follow-up, we detected 1799 (17.6%) incident cases. After adjustment for socio-demographics, family history of diabetes, and behavioral risk factors, comparing the fourth (≥ 566 g/day) with the first (< 236 g/day) quartile of UPF distribution, RR was 1.24 (1.10-1.39); every 150 g/day increments in UPF consumption resulted in a RR of 1.05 (1.03-1.07). Reclassifying natural beverages with added sweeteners as UPF increased risk (RR 1.40; 1.25-1.58). Among UPF subgroupings, consumption of processed meats and sweetened beverages increased diabetes risk, while yogurt and dairy sweets decreased the risk (p < 0.05).
UPF consumption increased the incidence of type 2 diabetes in Brazilian adults, with heterogeneity across specific food items. These findings add to previous evidence for the role of UPFs in the development of diabetes and other chronic diseases, supporting recommendations to avoid their intake in diabetes prevention and management.",type 2 diabetics

Human mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (hUCMSCs-Exo) have diverse functions in improving microcirculation; however, the molecular mechanism of hUCMSCs-Exo in regulating burn-induced inflammation is not well understood.
hUCMSCs-Exo were extracted by hypervelocity centrifugation method, and exosome morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy, exosome diameter distribution was detected by particle size analysis, and exosome specific proteins were identified by Western blot.2. DB/DB mice were randomly divided into exosomes group and PBS group. Exosomes and PBS were injected into the tail vein, respectively, and the calf muscle tissue was taken 28 days later. 0.5% Evans blue fluorescence assessment microvascular permeability. The expression of CD31 was detected by immunofluorescence.The morphology and function of microvessels in muscle tissue of lower limbs was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy.3. TMT proteomics was used to detect the changes of differential protein expression in lower limb muscle tissues of the PBS group and the exosome group, and data analysis was performed to screen key signal molecules and their involved biological pathways. Key signal molecules CD105 were verified by Western blot. The expression of TGF-β1 in exosomes were evaluated by Western blot.
Electron microscopy showed that hUCMSCs-Exo presented a uniform vesicle structure, and NTA showed that its diameter was about 160 nm. Western blot showed positive expression of specific proteins CD9, CD81 and TSG101 on exosomes.2. There is no significant change in blood glucose and body weight before and after the exosome treatment. The exosome group can significantly reduce the exudation of Evans blue. Compared with the PBS group. Meanwhile, CD31 immunofluorescence showed that the red fluorescence of exosome treatment was significantly increased, which was higher than that of PBS group. Transmission electron microscopy showed smooth capillary lumen and smooth and complete surface of endothelial cells in the exosome group, while narrow capillary lumen and fingerlike protrusion of endothelial cells in the PBS group.3.Quantitative analysis of TMT proteomics showed that there were 82 differential proteins, including 49 down-regulated proteins and 33 up-regulated proteins. Go enrichment analysis showed that the differential proteins were involved in molecular function, biological process, cell components,among which CD105 was one of the up-regulated proteins. Through literature search, CD105 was found to be related to endothelial cell proliferation. Therefore, this study verified the changes of CD105 in the exosome group, and it was used as the mechanism study of this study. 4. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of CD105 protein in lower limb muscle tissue of exosome group was significantly increased compared with that of PBS group. Based on the fact that CD105 is a component of the TGF-β1 receptor complex and exosomes are rich in growth factors and cytokines, this study further examined the expression of TGF-β1 in exosomes, and the results showed that exosomes had high expression of TGF-β1.
By improving the integrity of microvascular endothelial cells, hUCMSCs-Exo can improve the permeability of microvessels in diabetic lower muscle tissue, further promote the proliferation of lower limb muscle cells and inhibit the apoptosis of tissue cells. The mechanism may be associated with exosomes rich in TGF-β1, which is likely to promote endothelial cell proliferation and improve permeability through binding to the endothelial CD105/TβR-II receptor complex, while promoting angiogenesis and protecting skeletal muscle cells from apoptosis.",type 2 diabetics
Effect of Uncaria tomentosa aqueous extract on the response to palmitate-induced lipotoxicity in cultured skeletal muscle cells.,"['Bruna Leticiade Freitas-Marchi', 'Jeniffer FariasDos Santos', 'Gustavo RoncoliReigado', 'Myrian Thiago PruschinskiFernandes', 'Felipe Santiago ChambergoAlcalde', 'Carla Robertade Oliveira Carvalho', 'Viviane AbreuNunes']","Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is frequently associated with dyslipidemia, which corresponds to the increase in the triglycerides and fatty acid concentrations in tissues, such as the skeletal muscle. Also, T2DM molecular mechanism involves increasing in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress. The use of herbal medicines such as Uncaria tomentosa (Ut) has been proposed as an auxiliary treatment for patients with T2DM. In this study, it was evaluated the effect of Ut aqueous extract on cell viability and ROS production, in skeletal myoblasts from C2C12 lineage exposed to the free fatty acid palmitate (PA).
Cells were incubated with PA in different concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 μM, for 24 or 48 h, for cytotoxicity assay. Cell death, DNA fragmentation and ROS production assays were performed in cell cultures incubated with PA for 24 h, in the pre (preventive condition) or post treatment (therapeutic condition) with 250 μg/ml Ut aqueous extract, for 2 or 6 h. Cell death was evaluated by MTT method or flow cytometry. ROS generation was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy using the DCFDA probe.
Cell viability was reduced to approximately 44% after the incubation with PA for 24 h from the concentration of 500 µM. In the incubation of cells with 500 μM PA and Ut extract for 6 h, in both conditions (preventive or therapeutic), it was observed an increase of 27 and 70% in cell viability respectively, in comparison to the cultures incubated with only PA. Also, the incubation of cultures with 500 μM PA, for 24 h, increased 20-fold the ROS formation, while the treatment with Ut extract, for 6 h, both in the preventive or therapeutic conditions, promoted decrease of 21 and 55%, respectively.
The Ut extract was efficient in promoting cell protection against PA lipotoxicity and ROS generation, potentially preventing oxidative stress in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Since T2DM molecular mechanism involves oxidative stress condition and it is often associated with dyslipidemia and fatty acid accumulation in muscle tissue, these results open perspectives for the use of Ut as an auxiliary strategy for T2DM management.",type 2 diabetics

A total of 445 adolescents (12-18 years) and 413 parents participated in an anonymous cross-sectional survey conducted at three German diabetes centres from January 2021 to June 2022. Inclusion criteria were diabetes duration ≥1 year and German-speaking. Teen HRQoL was assessed by using self-report and parent-proxy report versions of the KIDSCREEN-10 index.
The majority of adolescents reported average (75.5%) HRQoL. Approximately 11.3% of teens reported high and 13.2% low HRQoL. Teen's female gender, older age, higher diabetes burden and parental depression symptoms contributed to lower self-reported HRQoL among teens. For parent-proxy reports, increasing diabetes burdens, parental depression symptoms, non-migrant status, high education and ketoacidosis contributed to lower scores on teen HRQoL. The mean scores of the KIDSCREEN-10 index for adolescents did not differ from the German norm. In comparison to healthy peers during the first wave of the pandemic, adolescents in the current study reported higher HRQoL. The overall teen-parent agreement was fair although parents reported significantly lower teen HRQoL than adolescents did.
HRQoL of most adolescents with T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic was average with parents reporting significantly lower scores. Self-reported and parent-proxy-reported HRQoL and the level of agreement due to different perspectives can provide important information for clinical care and intervention planning.",type 2 diabetics
"Treatment-induced neuropathy of diabetes: challenges in diagnosing neuropathic pain, value of sudomotor function testing.","['SalimAbdelhamid', 'MajlindaShabani', 'ArkadiuszRussjan', 'Alexander AndreaTarnutzer']","A patient in his 60s was admitted for an extensive neurological work-up due to progressive asymmetrical, distally pronounced pain in both feet and legs. Conventional pain relievers did not help in pain reduction. A Sudoscan revealed small fibre damage in all extremities indicating an underlying neuropathy. The patient had started insulin treatment around 6 months prior to hospitalisation because of a newly diagnosed late-onset diabetes. Due to a rapid drop in glycated haemoglobin (from over 14% to 6% in 4 months), treatment-induced neuropathy of diabetes (TIND) was hypothesised. On increasing the dose of pregabalin and adding duloxetine, the patient reported improvement of symptoms, which further underlined the suspected diagnosis. Hence, in patients with severe hyperglycaemia, changes in glycaemic control should be stepwise and not rapid; however, to date, no guidelines exist how to avoid TIND.",type 2 diabetics

The Intervention of Probiotics on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Animal Models.,"['QianyuQu', 'PenggangHe', 'YuqiZhang', 'ShujuanYang', 'PeibinZeng']","Type 2 diabetes accounts for more than 90% of diabetes patients with the incidence and prevalence continuously rising globally. As a prospective therapy strategy for type 2 diabetes, probiotics have shown beneficial effects both in animal experiments and human clinical trials. This review summarizes the commonly used animal models in probiotic intervention research and presents the evidence and mechanism of diabetes intervention with probiotics in these animal models. Probiotics can help maintain glucose homeostasis, improve lipid metabolism, promote the production of short-chain fatty acids, and reduce inflammatory reactions in animal models. However, the clinical translation of benefits from probiotics is still challenged by intrinsic differences between experimental animal models and humans, and the application of humanized non-rodent diabetic animal models may contribute to the clinical translation of probiotics in the future.",type 2 diabetics
Glycemia and Gluconeogenesis with Metformin and Liraglutide: A Randomized Trial in Youth-onset Type 2 Diabetes.,"['Katrina BDietsche', 'Sheela NMagge', 'Sydney ADixon', 'Faith SDavis', 'AndreaKrenek', 'ArubaChowdhury', 'LilianMabundo', 'MichaelStagliano', 'Amber BCourville', 'ShannaYang', 'SaraTurner', 'HongyiCai', 'KannanKasturi', 'Arthur SSherman', 'JoonHa', 'EileenShouppe', 'MaryWalter', 'Peter JWalter', 'Kong YChen', 'Robert JBrychta', 'CodyPeer', 'YiZeng', 'WilliamFigg', 'FranCogen', 'D ElizabethEstrada', 'ShajiChacko', 'Stephanie TChung']","Elevated rates of gluconeogenesis are an early pathogenic feature of youth-onset type 2 diabetes (Y-T2D), but targeted first-line therapies are suboptimal, especially in African American (AA) youth. We evaluated glucose-lowering mechanisms of metformin and liraglutide by measuring rates of gluconeogenesis and β-cell function after therapy in AA Y-T2D.
In this parallel randomized clinical trial, 22 youth with Y-T2D: age 15.3±2.1y (mean±SD), 68% female, BMI 40.1±7.9kg/m2, duration of diagnosis 1.8±1.3y were randomized to metformin alone (Met) or metformin+liraglutide (Met+Lira) and evaluated before and after 12 weeks. Stable isotope tracers were used to measure gluconeogenesis [2H2O] and glucose production [6,6-2H2]glucose after an overnight fast and during a continuous meal. β-cell function (sigma) and whole-body insulin sensitivity (mSI) were assessed during a frequently sampled 2h-OGTT.
At baseline, gluconeogenesis, glucose production, and fasting and 2h glucose were comparable in both groups, though Met+Lira had higher HbA1c. Met+Lira had a greater decrease from baseline in fasting glucose (-2.0±1.3 vs. -0.6±0.9 mmol/L, P=0.008) and a greater increase in sigma (0.72±0.68 vs. -0.05±0.71, P=0.03). The change in fractional gluconeogenesis was similar between groups (Met+Lira: -0.36±9.4 vs. Met: 0.04±12.3%, P=0.9) and there were no changes in prandial gluconeogenesis or mSI. Increased glucose clearance in both groups was related to sigma (r=0.63, P=0.003) but not gluconeogenesis or mSI.
Among Y-T2D, metformin with or without liraglutide improved glycemia but did not suppress high rates of gluconeogenesis. Novel therapies that will enhance β-cell function and target the elevated rates of gluconeogenesis in Y-T2D are needed.",type 2 diabetics
Risk and incidence of endocrine immune related adverse effects under checkpoint inhibitor mono or combination therapy in solid tumors: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"['IrfanVardarli', 'SusanneTan', 'TimBrandenburg', 'FrankWeidemann', 'RainerGörges', 'KenHerrmann', 'DagmarFührer']","Few meta-analyses regarding the incidence of endocrine immune related adverse effects (eirAEs) have been published and many trials were published thereafter.
To assess the risk and incidence of eirAEs of any grade and grade 3-5 by immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) mono or combination-therapy in solid tumors current literature was updated in this comprehensive meta-analysis.
An electronic search using PubMed/Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library was performed. Randomized controlled studies (RCT) assessing eirAEs under ICI-mono or ICI-combination therapy were selected. Stata software version 17 was used for statistical analyses and risk of bias was evaluated by using Review Manager version 5.3.
69 RCTs with 80 independent reports, involving 42,886 patients were included in the study. Meta-analysis revealed the following pooled estimates for the risk ratio and the incidence, respectively: for any grade hypothyroidism 7.81 (95% CI, 5.68-10.74, p< 0.0001) and 7.64% (95% CI, 6.23-9.17, p< 0.0001); significantly increased also for hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis/hypopituitarism and adrenal insufficiency; and for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 1.52 (95% CI, 1.07-2.18, p= 0.02), and 0.087% (95% CI, 0.019-0.189, p= 0.0006), respectively. Meta-regression showed that combination of ICIs (nivolumab plus ipilimumab and durvalumab plus tremelimumab, respectively) is an independent risk factor for any grade hypophysitis/hypopituitarism, and that ICI agent is an independent factor of risk for adrenal insufficiency, but that cancer type is not an independent risk factor for eirAEs.
We showed that risk, independent from cancer type, and incidence of eAEs are substantially increased under ICI therapy. Combination of ICIs is increasing the risk for eirAEs, in particular for hypophysitis/hypopituitarism.",type 2 diabetics
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome Physiologic Pathways Implicated Through Clustering of Genetic Loci.,"['Maria IStamou', 'Kirk TSmith', 'HyunkyungKim', 'RavikumarBalasubramanian', 'Kathryn JGray', 'MiriamUdler']","Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous disorder, with disease loci identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) having largely unknown relationships to disease pathogenesis.
To group PCOS GWAS loci into genetic clusters associated with disease pathophysiology.
Cluster analysis was performed for 60 PCOS-associated genetic variants and 49 traits using GWAS summary statistics. Cluster-specific PCOS partitioned polygenic scores (pPS) were generated and tested for association with clinical phenotypes in the Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB, N=62,252). Associations with clinical outcomes (type 2 diabetes/T2D, coronary artery disease/CAD and female reproductive traits) were assessed using both GWAS-based pPS (DIAMANTE, N=898,130, CARDIOGRAM/UKBB, N=547,261) and individual-level pPS in MGBB.
Four PCOS genetic clusters were identified with top loci indicated as following: (i) Cluster 1/Obesity/insulin resistance (FTO); (ii) Cluster 2/Hormonal/menstrual cycle changes (FSHB); (iii) Cluster 3/Blood markers/inflammation (ATXN2/SH2B3); (iv) Cluster 4/Metabolic changes (MAF, SLC38A11). Cluster pPS were associated with distinct clinical traits: Cluster 1 with increased body mass index (BMI; p=6.6x10-29); Cluster 2 with increased age of menarche (p= p=1.5x10-4); Cluster 3 with multiple decreased blood markers, including mean platelet volume (MPV; p=3.1 x10-5); and Cluster 4 with increased ALP (p=0.007). PCOS genetic clusters GWAS-pPS's were also associated with disease outcomes: Cluster 1 pPS with increased T2D (OR 1.07; p=7.3x10-50), with replication in MGBB all participants (OR 1.09, p=2.7x10-7) and females only (OR 1.11, 4.8x10-5).

Signs of Glucagon Resistance After a Two-Week Hypercaloric Diet Intervention.,"['Malte PalmSuppli', 'AstridHøgedal', 'Jonatan IsingBagger', 'ElizavetaChabanova', 'Gerritvan Hall', 'Julie LyngForman', 'Mikkel BringChristensen', 'Nicolai Jacob WewerAlbrechtsen', 'Jens JuulHolst', 'Filip KragKnop']","Hyperglucagonemia is observed in individuals with obesity and contributes to the hyperglycemia of patients with type 2 diabetes. Hyperglucagonemia may develop due to steatosis-induced hepatic glucagon resistance resulting in impaired hepatic amino acid turnover and ensuing elevations of circulating glucagonotropic amino acids.
We evaluated whether glucagon resistance could be induced in healthy individuals by a hypercaloric diet intervention designed to increase hepatic fat content.
We recruited 20 healthy, male individuals to follow a hypercaloric diet and a sedentary lifestyle for two weeks. Amino acid concentrations in response to infusion of glucagon were assessed during a pancreatic clamp with somatostatin and basal insulin. The reversibility of any metabolic changes was assessed eight weeks after the intervention. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
The intervention led to increased hepatic fat content (382 [206; 705]%, P < 0.01). Glucagon infusion led to a decrease in the concentration of total amino acids on all experimental days, but the percentage change in total amino acids was reduced (-2.5 ± 0.5 vs. -0.2 ± 0.7%, P = 0.015) and the average slope of the decline in the total amino acid concentration was less steep (-2.0 ± 1.2 vs. -1.2 ± 0.3 μM/min, P = 0.016) after the intervention compared to baseline. The changes were normalized at follow-up.
Our results indicate that short-term unhealthy behavior, which increases hepatic fat content, causes a reversible resistance to the effect of glucagon on amino acid concentrations in healthy individuals, which may explain the hyperglucagonemia associated with obesity and diabetes.",type 2 diabetics
Community-based models of care for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus among non-pregnant adults in sub-Saharan Africa: A scoping review.,"['EmmanuelFirima', 'LuciaGonzalez', 'FabiolaUrsprung', 'ElenaRobinson', 'JacquelineHuber', 'Jennifer MBelus', 'FabianRaeber', 'RaviGupta', 'Gibrilla FDeen', 'AlainAmstutz', 'BailahLeigh', 'MajaWeisser', 'Niklaus DanielLabhardt']","The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and associated morbidity and mortality are increasing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To facilitate access to quality care and improve treatment outcomes, there is a need for innovative community care models and optimized use of non-physician healthcare workers bringing diagnosis and care closer to patients' homes.
We aimed to describe with a scoping review different models of community-based care for non-pregnant adults with T2DM in SSA, and to synthesize the outcomes in terms of engagement in care, blood sugar control, acceptability, and end-organ damage. We further aimed to critically appraise the different models of care and compare community-based to facility-based care if data were available.
We searched Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Scopus, supplemented with backward and forward citation searches. We included cohort studies, randomized trials and case-control studies that reported on non-pregnant individuals diagnosed with T2DM in SSA, who received a substantial part of care in the community. Only studies which reported at least one of our outcomes of interest were included. A narrative analysis was done, and comparisons made between community-based and facility-based models, where within-study comparison was reported.
We retrieved 5,335 unique studies, four of which met our inclusion criteria. Most studies were excluded because interventions were facility-based; community care interventions described in the studies were only add-on features of a primarily facility-based care; and studies did not report outcomes of interest. The included studies reported on a total of 383 individuals with T2DM. Three different community care models were identified. 1) A community-initiated model where diagnosis, treatment and monitoring occurred primarily in the community. This model reported a higher linkage and engagement in care at 9 months compared to the corresponding facility model, but only slight reductions of average blood glucose levels at six months compared to baseline. 2) A facility-originated community model where after treatment initiation, a substantial part of follow-up was offered at community level. Two studies reported such a model of care, both had as core component home-delivery of medication. Acceptability of this approach was high. But neither study found improved T2DM control when compared to facility care 3) An eHealth model with high acceptability scores for both patients and care providers, and an absolute 1.76% reduction in average HbA1c levels at two months compared to baseline. There were no reported outcomes on end-organ damage. All four studies were rated as being at high risk for bias.
Evidence on models of care for persons with T2DM in SSA where a substantial part of care is shifted to the community is scant. Whereas available literature indicates high acceptability of community-based care, we found no conclusive data on their effectiveness in controlling blood sugar and preventing complications. Evidence from larger scale studies, ideally randomized trials with clinically relevant endpoints is needed before roll-out of community-based T2DM care can be recommended in SSA.",type 2 diabetics
Patient-level explainable machine learning to predict major adverse cardiovascular events from SPECT MPI and CCTA imaging.,"['FaresAlahdab', 'RadwaEl Shawi', 'Ahmed IbrahimAhmed', 'YushuiHan', 'MouazAl-Mallah']","Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in improving the risk prediction in non-invasive cardiovascular imaging, including SPECT MPI and coronary CT angiography. However, most algorithms used remain black boxes to clinicians in how they compute their predictions. Furthermore, objective consideration of the multitude of available clinical data, along with the visual and quantitative assessments from CCTA and SPECT, are critical for optimal patient risk stratification. We aim to provide an explainable ML approach to predict MACE using clinical, CCTA, and SPECT data.
Consecutive patients who underwent clinically indicated CCTA and SPECT myocardial imaging for suspected CAD were included and followed up for MACEs. A MACE was defined as a composite outcome that included all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or late revascularization. We employed an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) approach to predict MACE using clinical, CCTA, and SPECT data. Various mainstream models with different sets of hyperparameters have been explored, and critical predictors of risk are obtained using explainable techniques on the global and patient levels. Ten-fold cross-validation was used in training and evaluating the AutoML model.
A total of 956 patients were included (mean age 61.1 ±14.2 years, 54% men, 89% hypertension, 81% diabetes, 84% dyslipidemia). Obstructive CAD on CCTA and ischemia on SPECT were observed in 14% of patients, and 11% experienced MACE. ML prediction's sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy in predicting a MACE were 69.61%, 99.77%, and 96.54%, respectively. The top 10 global predictive features included 8 CCTA attributes (segment involvement score, number of vessels with severe plaque ≥70, ≥50% stenosis in the left marginal coronary artery, calcified plaque, ≥50% stenosis in the left circumflex coronary artery, plaque type in the left marginal coronary artery, stenosis degree in the second obtuse marginal of the left circumflex artery, and stenosis category in the marginals of the left circumflex artery) and 2 clinical features (past medical history of MI or left bundle branch block, being an ever smoker).
ML can accurately predict risk of developing a MACE in patients suspected of CAD undergoing SPECT MPI and CCTA. ML feature-ranking can also show, at a sample- as well as at a patient-level, which features are key in making such a prediction.",type 2 diabetics
"The effectiveness of interventions to reduce cardio-metabolic risk factors among regular street food consumers in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: The pre-post findings from a cluster randomized trial (Registered by Pan African clinical trial registry with trial # PACTR202208642850935).","['Gibson BKagaruki', 'Michael JMahande', 'Mary TMayige', 'Katharina SKreppel', 'Esther SNgadaya', 'DanielHaydon', 'Godfather DKimaro', 'Sayoki GMfinanga', 'BassirouBonfoh']","The healthy plate model (HPM) is a practical guide to modulate the portion of staple food in main meals, subsequently affecting the risks associated with Non-communicable Diseases include type2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
This study investigated the effectiveness of health information and the healthy plate model on cardio-metabolic risk factors, knowledge and attitude towards T2DM prevention measures.
A pre-post analysis, as part of a cluster randomized trial with street food vendors and their customers, was implemented in three randomly selected districts in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Two vendor-customer clusters each with 15 and more vendors from each district were randomly assigned to receive either T2DM health information only (Intervention package1 [IP1]) or IP1 plus a subsidized meal with vegetables and fruits, following the principles of the HPM (Intervention package2 [IP2]). Within the clusters the participants were informed on the importance of the intervention they received. An intervention period lasted for three months from 1st April to 31st June 2019. We applied Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Bayesian Modelling (for sensitivity analysis) to assess the effectiveness of the interventions.
Overall, 336 (IP2 = 175 and IP1 = 161) out of 560 (280/arm) previous study participants participated in evaluation. Diastolic BP was lower among IP2 participants in the evaluation than baseline AβC = -4.1mmHg (95%CI:-5.42 to -2.76). After adjusting for the interaction between IP2 and age of the consumers, the BMI was significantly lower among IP2 in the evaluation than baseline AβC = -0.7kg/m2 (95%CI: -1.17 to -0.23). With interaction between IP2 and income, BMI was higher in the IP2 in the evaluation than baseline AβC = 0.73kg/m2 (95%CI: 0.08 to 1.38). Systolic and diastolic BP were significantly lower among IP1 in the evaluation than baseline AβC = -3.5mmHg (95%CI:-5.78 to -1.24) and AβC = -5.9mmHg (95%CI:-7.34 to -4.44) respectively. Both the knowledge scores and positive attitudes towards T2DM prevention measures were higher in the evaluation than baseline in both interventions arms.
The positive effects on cardio-metabolic risk factors, knowledge and attitude were observed in both intervention arms. Due to interactions between IP2, age and income; designing interventions relating to food and cardio-metabolic risk factors, should consider combining socio-economic factors.",type 2 diabetics
Evaluation of an interprofessional follow-up intervention among people with type 2 diabetes in primary care-A randomized controlled trial with embedded qualitative interviews.,"['MaritGraue', 'JannickeIgland', 'AnneHaugstvedt', 'IngvildHernar', 'Kåre IBirkeland', 'VibekeZoffmann', 'David ARichards', 'Beate-Christin HopeKolltveit']","With an ageing population and improved treatments people live longer with their chronic diseases, and primary care clinics face more costly and difficult-to-treat multimorbid patients. To meet these challenges, current guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes suggest that an interprofessional team should collaborate to enhance the delivery of worthwhile self-management support interventions. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of an empowerment-based interprofessional follow-up intervention in people with type 2 diabetes in primary care on patient-reported outcomes, biomarkers and weight, and to explore the experiences of patients attending the intervention. We invited patients during regular visits to their general practitioners. The 12-month intervention included 1) empowerment-based counselling; 2) a standardized medical report. The control group received consultations with physicians only. The primary outcome was the Patient Activation Measure, a patient-reported measure assessing individual knowledge, skills, and confidence integral to managing one's health and healthcare. After the trial we conducted qualitative interviews. We observed no difference in the primary outcome scores. On secondary outcomes we found a significant between-group intervention effect in favor of the intervention group, with mean differences in glycemic control after 12 months (B [95% CI] = -8.6 [-17.1, -0.1] mmol/l; p = 0.045), and significant within-group changes of weight (B [95% CI] = -1.8 kg [-3.3, -0.3]; p = 0.02) and waist circumference (B [95% CI] = -3.9 cm [-7.3, -0.6]; p = 0.02). The qualitative data showed that the intervention opened patients' eyes for reflections and greater awareness, but they needed time to take on actions. The patients emphasized that the intervention gave rise to other insights and a greater understanding of their health challenges. We suggest testing the intervention among patients with larger disease burden and a more expressed motivation for change.",type 2 diabetics

Despite the growing evidence on the effectiveness of mobile health interventions in the management of DM2, the evidence on the effect of mobile health interventions in prevention of DM2 is sparse. Therefore, we have developed an app aiming to promote initiation of behavioral change and adherence to healthy behavior. Before commencing a small-scale randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility of using an app for initiation and adherence of healthy behavior in people at risk of DM2, testing the usability of the app in the target population is warranted.
The aim of this study was to assess the usability of an app among people at risk of DM2.
A qualitative study with the use of a think aloud (TA) procedure was conducted from April to November 2022. The TA procedure consisted of 10 problem-solving tasks and a semistructured interview which was carried out after the tasks. These interviews served to gain more in-depth knowledge of the users experience of the problem-solving tasks. The TA-sessions and the postactivity interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and the data were coded and analyzed following the principles of thematic analysis.
In total, 7 people at risk of DM2 with a median age of 66 (range 41-75) years participated in this study. The analysis resulted in the following themes: (1) user interface design; and (2) suggestions for improvements of the functionality of the app.
Overall, the participants were satisfied with the usability of the app. Through the TA-sessions, real time perspective on the appeal, relevance, and utility of the app were gained. Only minor changes to the functionality of the prototype app were reported as necessary to improve the usability of the app. Points of guidance from the participants in this study have been adopted and incorporated into the final design of the app now being assessed for feasibility in a small-scale randomized controlled trial.",type 2 diabetics

Ascertainment of Minimal Clinically Important Differences in the Diabetes Distress Scale-17: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.,"['JackBanks', 'Amber BAmspoker', 'Elizabeth MVaughan', 'LeChauncyWoodard', 'Aanand DNaik']","The Diabetes Distress Scale-17 (DDS-17) is a common measure of diabetes distress. Despite its popularity, there are no agreed-on minimal clinically important difference (MCID) values for the DDS-17.
To establish a distribution-based metric for MCID in the DDS-17 and its 4 subscale scores (interpersonal distress, physician distress, regimen distress, and emotional distress).
This secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial used baseline and postintervention data from a hybrid (implementation-effectiveness) trial evaluating Empowering Patients in Chronic Care (EPICC) vs an enhanced form of usual care (EUC). Participants included adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] level >8.0%) who received primary care during the prior year in participating Department of Veterans Affairs clinics across Illinois, Indiana, and Texas. Data collection was completed in November 2018, and data analysis was completed in June 2023.
Participants in EPICC attended 6 group sessions led by health care professionals based on collaborative goal-setting theory. EUC included diabetes education.
The main outcome was distribution-based MCID values for the total DDS-17 and 4 DDS-17 subscales, calculated using the standard error of measurement. Baseline to postintervention changes in DDS-17 and its 4 subscale scores were grouped into 3 categories: improved, no change, and worsened. Multilevel logistic and linear regression models examined associations between treatment group and MCID change categories and whether improvement in HbA1c varied in association with MCID category.
A total of 248 individuals with complete DDS-17 data were included (mean [SD] age, 67.4 [8.3] years; 235 [94.76%] men), with 123 participants in the EPICC group and 125 participants in the EUC group. The MCID value for DDS-17 was 0.25 and MCID values for the 4 distress subscales were 0.38 for emotional and interpersonal distress and 0.39 for physician and regimen distress. Compared with EUC, more EPICC participants were in the MCID improvement category on DDS-17 (63 participants [51.22%] vs 40 participants [32.00%]; P = .003) and fewer EPICC participants were in the worsened category (20 participants [16.26%] vs 39 participants [31.20%]; P = .008). There was no direct association of DDS-17 MCID improvement (β = -0.25; 95% CI, -0.59 to 0.10; P = .17) or worsening (β = 0.18; 95% CI, -0.22 to 0.59; P = .38) with HbA1c levels among all participants.
In this secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial, an MCID improvement or worsening of more than 0.25 on the DDS-17 was quantitatively significant and patients in the EPICC group were more likely to experience improvement than those in the EUC group.

The effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) remain inconclusive. We aimed to investigate whether SGLT2 inhibitors can prevent AF occurrence in patients with cardiometabolic diseases.
We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL database up to July 1, 2023. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with diabetes, heart failure, chronic kidney diseases, or cardiometabolic risk factors were included. The primary outcome was AF occurrence. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in the overall population and selected subgroups.
Forty-six trials comprising 101 100 patients were included. Overall, no significant risk reduction of AF occurrence was observed with SGLT2 inhibitors, although there was a favorable trend (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80-1.01). In trials with follow-up durations of over one year, a similar result was achieved (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.80-1.01). The results were consistent across different SGLT2 inhibitors, with RRs (95%CIs) of 0.82 (0.60-1.12) for canagliflozin, 0.87 (0.73-1.03) for dapagliflozin, 0.97 (0.78-1.22) for empagliflozin, 0.99 (0.66-1.50) for sotagliflozin, and 0.87 (0.58-1.29) for ertugliflozin. Analyses in different doses of SGLT2 inhibitors yielded similar results. The associations between SGLT2 inhibitors and AF occurrence were also absent in patients with diabetes, heart failure, and chronic kidney diseases.
For patients with cardiometabolic diseases or risk factors, SGLT2 inhibitors did not decrease the risk of AF occurrence, regardless of follow-up duration, type or dose of the drug, or the patient population.

The study was to investigate the effect of circRNA PIP5K1A (circPIP5K1A) on glucose and lipid metabolism and inflammation in T2DM rats. A T2DM rat model was established, and then the T2DM rats were injected with lentiviral vectors that interfere with circPIP5K1A, miR-552-3p, or ENO1 expression. Fasting blood glucose (FBG) and fasting insulin (FINS) levels of rats were detected by an automatic analyzer and insulin detection kit, and HOMA-IR was calculated. Lipid metabolism was assessed by measuring serum levels of TG, TC, LDL-C, leptin, and resistin. Serum levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α and IL-6) were detected by ELISA. The pathological conditions of pancreatic tissue were observed by HE staining. circPIP5K1A, miR-552-3p and ENO1 levels were recorded. The experimental results showed that circPIP5K1A and ENO1 were up-regulated, and miR-552-3p was down-regulated in T2DM rats. Down-regulating circPIP5K1A or up-regulating miR-552-3p reduced blood glucose and lipid levels, inhibited inflammation, and improved pancreatic histopathological changes in T2DM rats. In addition, up-regulating ENO1 rescued the ameliorating effects of down-regulated circPIP5K1A on T2DM rats. In general, downregulating circPIP5K1A improves insulin resistance and lipid metabolism disorders and inhibits inflammation by targeting miR-552-3p to mediate ENO1 expression.",type 2 diabetics
Does a Ketogenic Diet Have a Place Within Diabetes Clinical Practice? Review of Current Evidence and Controversies.,"['Chloe HFirman', 'Duane DMellor', 'DavidUnwin', 'AdrianBrown']","Carbohydrate restriction has gained increasing popularity as an adjunctive nutritional therapy for diabetes management. However, controversy remains regarding the long-term suitability, safety, efficacy and potential superiority of a very low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet compared to current recommended nutritional approaches for diabetes management. Recommendations with respect to a ketogenic diet in clinical practice are often hindered by the lack of established definition, which prevents its capacity to be most appropriately prescribed as a therapeutic option for diabetes. Furthermore, with conflicted evidence, this has led to uncertainty amongst clinicians on how best to support and advise their patients. This review will explore whether a ketogenic diet has a place within clinical practice by reviewing current evidence and controversies.",type 2 diabetics
Amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion: a path forward in type 2 diabetes.,"['JelenaKolic', 'WenQing GraceSun', 'James DJohnson', 'NicolaGuess']","Qualitative and quantitatively appropriate insulin secretion is essential for optimal control of blood glucose. Beta-cells of the pancreas produce and secrete insulin in response to glucose and non-glucose stimuli including amino acids. In this manuscript, we review the literature on amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion in oral and intravenous in vivo studies, in addition to the in vitro literature, and describe areas of consensus and gaps in understanding. We find promising evidence that the synergism of amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion could be exploited to develop novel therapeutics, but that a systematic approach to investigating these lines of evidence is lacking. We highlight evidence that supports the relative preservation of amino acid-stimulated insulin secretion compared to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes, and make the case for the therapeutic potential of amino acids. Finally, we make recommendations for research and describe the potential clinical utility of nutrient-based treatments for type 2 diabetes including remission services.",type 2 diabetics
The cardiovascular effects of novel weight loss therapies.,"['Muhammad ShariqUsman', 'MelanieDavies', 'Michael EHall', 'SubodhVerma', 'Stefan DAnker', 'JulioRosenstock', 'JavedButler']","The prevalence of overweight and obesity has reached pandemic proportions. Obesity is known to increase the risk for Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, as well as the risk for overt cardiovascular (CV) disease, including myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke. The rising prevalence of obesity may counteract the recent advances in primary and secondary prevention of CV disease. Overweight and obesity are common in patients with CV disease; however, cardiologists face several challenges in managing body weight in this population. Many may not consider obesity as a therapeutic target probably because there were no previous highly effective and safe pharmacologic interventions to consider. In addition, they may not have the expertise or resources to implement lifestyle interventions and may have limited familiarity with obesity pharmacotherapy. Moreover, the long-term CV effects of obesity pharmacotherapy remain uncertain due to limited CV outcome data with weight loss as the primary intervention. Although current CV guidelines recognize the importance of weight loss, they primarily focus on lifestyle modifications, with fewer details on strategies to utilize obesity pharmacotherapy and surgery. However, the recent 2022 American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes consensus on the management of Type 2 diabetes has moved up weight management to the front of the treatment algorithm, by prioritizing the use of pharmacologic interventions such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, which have potent weight-lowering effects, in addition to glucose-lowering effects. This review appraises the current evidence regarding the CV effects of weight-loss interventions. Considering this evidence, practical guidance is provided to assist cardiologists in developing and implementing treatment plans, which may allow optimal weight management while maximizing CV benefits and minimizing side effects to improve the overall well-being of people with CV disease.",type 2 diabetics

With an increasing interest in natural dietary components for diabetes management, the identification of novel agents witnessed major discoveries. Plant-derived mucilage, pectin, and inulin are important non-starch polysaccharides that exhibit effective antidiabetic properties often termed soluble dietary fiber (SDF). SDF affects sugar metabolism through multiple mechanisms affecting glucose absorption and diffusion, modulation of carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes (α-amylase and α-glucosidase), ameliorating β-pancreatic cell dysfunction, and improving insulin release or sensitivity. Certain SDFs inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and influence the expression levels of genes related to glucose metabolism. This review is designed to discuss holistically and critically the antidiabetic effects of major SDF and their underlying mechanisms of action.

A diagnosis model for brain atrophy using deep learning and MRI of type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"['Saba RaoofSyed', 'Saleem DuraiM A']","Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is linked to cognitive deterioration and anatomical brain abnormalities like cerebral brain atrophy and cerebral diseases. We aim to develop an automatic deep learning-based brain atrophy diagnosis model to detect, segment, classify, and predict the survival rate.
Two hundred thirty-five MRI images affected with brain atrophy due to prolonged T2DM were acquired. The dataset was divided into training and testing (80:20%; 188, 47, respectively). Pre-processing is done through a novel convolutional median filter, followed by segmentation of atrophy regions, i.e., the brain shrinkage, white and gray matter is done through the proposed TRAU-Net model (Transfer Residual Attention U-Net), classification with the proposed Multinomial Logistic regression with Attention Swin Transformer (MLAST), and prediction of chronological age is determined through Multivariate CoX Regression model (MCR). The classification of Brain Atrophy (BA) types is determined based on the features extracted from the segmented region. Performance measures like confusion matrix, specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve are used to measure classification model performance, whereas, for the segmentation model, pixel accuracy and dice similarity coefficient are applied.
The pixel accuracy and dice coefficient for segmentation were 98.25 and 96.41, respectively. Brain atrophy multi-class classification achieved overall training accuracy is 0.9632 ± 1.325, 0.9677 ± 1.912, 0.9682 ± 1.715, and 0.9521 ± 1.877 for FA, PA, R-MTA, and L-MTA, respectively. The overall AUC-ROC curve for the classification model is 0.9856. The testing and validation accuracy obtained for the proposed model are 0.9379 and 0.9694, respectively. The prediction model's performance is measured using correlation coefficient (
The brain atrophy diagnosis model consists of sub-models to detect, segment, and classify the atrophy regions using novel deep learning and multivariate mathematical models.

"Do differences in sport participation contribute to socioeconomic health inequalities? Evidence from the Lifelines cohort study on all-cause mortality, diabetes and obesity.","['Willem I Jde Boer', 'Jochen OMierau', 'Ruud HKoning']","Little is known about the role of sport participation in socioeconomic health inequalities. We studied the association between different aspects of sport participation with all-cause mortality, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity, including inequalities between socioeconomic subpopulations. Using the Dutch Lifelines cohort study (n = 84,230), we assessed the associations of sport participation, as well as the amount, intensity, type and number of sports, with all-cause mortality, T2DM and obesity in individuals. We studied the effect of sport participation on health outcomes within and between educational categories. Outcomes were compared with moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Sport participation was significantly associated with lower mortality (HR = 0.81), T2DM (HR = 0.70), and obesity (HR = 0.77). No significant additional effects of the amount or intensity of sport participation were found, while participating in teams sport was associated with significantly lower mortality (HR = 0.53) compared with other types of sport. These effects were similar among educational categories. Sport participation explained between 11% (T2DM and obesity) and 22% (mortality) of health inequalities between educational categories. This was more than twice the effect size of MVPA. The sensitivity analysis with net income as the socioeconomic indicator showed similar results. Our results suggest that to reduce socioeconomic differences in health, public health policies should focus on increasing sport participation in groups with a low socioeconomic status, rather than increasing the amount or intensity of sport participation, or MVPA in general.",type 2 diabetics
Unraveling the role of VLDL in the relationship between type 2 diabetes and coronary atherosclerosis: a Mendelian randomization analysis.,"['WenshuaiFeng', 'LiuliGuo', 'YimanLiu', 'MingRen']","The causal link between Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary atherosclerosis has been established through wet lab experiments; however, its analysis with Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data remains unexplored. This study aims to validate this relationship using Mendelian randomization analysis and explore the potential mediation of VLDL in this mechanism.
Employing Mendelian randomization analysis, we investigated the causal connection between T2D and coronary atherosclerosis. We utilized GWAS summary statistics from European ancestry cohorts, comprising 23,363 coronary atherosclerosis patients and 195,429 controls, along with 32,469 T2D patients and 183,185 controls. VLDL levels, linked to SNPs, were considered as a potential mediating causal factor that might contribute to coronary atherosclerosis in the presence of T2D. We employed the inverse variance weighted (IVW), Egger regression (MR-Egger), weighted median, and weighted model methods for causal effect estimation. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was conducted to ensure robustness.
Our Mendelian randomization analysis demonstrated a genetic association between T2D and an increased coronary atherosclerosis risk, with the IVW estimate at 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-1.20]. Additionally, we observed a suggestive causal link between T2D and VLDL levels, as evidenced by the IVW estimate of 1.02 (95% CI: 0.98-1.07). Further supporting lipid involvement in coronary atherosclerosis pathogenesis, the IVW-Egger estimate was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.06-1.58).
In conclusion, this study highlights the autonomous contributions of T2D and VLDL levels to coronary atherosclerosis development. T2D is linked to a 13.35% elevated risk of coronary atherosclerosis, and within T2D patients, VLDL concentration rises by 2.49%. Notably, each standard deviation increase in VLDL raises the likelihood of heart disease by 29.6%. This underscores the significant role of lipid regulation, particularly VLDL, as a mediating pathway in coronary atherosclerosis progression.",type 2 diabetics

Prolonged reactions to chronic stress can be detrimental, resulting in various metabolic abnormalities, referred to as metabolic syndrome (MS). There is a reciprocal increased risk between MS and major depressive disorder. Recent studies established an association between inflammation and insulin signaling in type 2 diabetes mellitus with depression. In the present review, we discuss chronic low-grade inflammation, pathways of insulin resistance, and brain glucose metabolism in the context of neuroinflammation and depression. Specific attention is given to psychotropic drugs such as bupropion, mirtazapine, and nefazodone, anti-inflammatory drugs like Celecoxib (COX-2 inhibitor), Etanercept, adalimumab, IL-4Ra antagonist, Anti-IL- 17A antibody (Ixekizumab) and lifestyle modifications including exercise, dietary changes, and sleep hygiene. These therapeutic solutions offer potential in treating depression by targeting metabolic conditions like insulin resistance and inflammatory pathways. The article further explains the significance of a nutrition and antioxidants-rich diet, emphasizing the role of omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, zinc, and polyphenols, to improve immunity and activate anti-inflammatory signaling pathways.",type 2 diabetics

This study used data from a single center that provides follow-up on all its transplant recipients. The population of interest included all the patients who were transplanted between August 31, 1983 and December 31, 2022 and who were live from January 1, 2014. Using the ""AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average"" forecasting algorithm, the expected mortality for the pandemic era (2020-2022) was modeled from the pre-pandemic era (2014-2019).
There were 12 077 KTRs at risk of dying in the entire observation period. In the pre-pandemic era, there were 21 deaths per 1000 patients at risk. In the pandemic era, there were 1429 observed deaths (rate of 47 deaths per 1000 patients at risk) versus the expected 587 deaths, resulting in an absolute number of 842 excess deaths, or an observed-to-expected ratio of 2.4, or an absolute rate of 26 deaths in excess per 1000 patients at risk. The excess deaths exhibited a temporal pattern mirroring that of the surges in new cases and lethality rates of COVID-19. COVID-19-related deaths drove 94% of excess mortality in the pandemic era.
In this large cohort of KTR under centralized follow-up, more than twofold excess mortality was primarily driven by COVID-19-related deaths, highlighting the vulnerability of this population to the most severe presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",kidney disease
Low-Dose Methotrexate and Serious Adverse Events Among Older Adults With Chronic Kidney Disease.,"['Flory TMuanda', 'Peter GBlake', 'Matthew AWeir', 'FatemehAhmadi', 'EricMcArthur', 'Jessica MSontrop', 'Brad LUrquhart', 'Richard BKim', 'Amit XGarg']","Low-dose methotrexate is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Due to its kidney elimination, better evidence is needed to inform its safety in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
To compare the 90-day risk of serious adverse events among adults with CKD who started low-dose methotrexate vs those who started hydroxychloroquine and to compare the risk of serious adverse events among adults with CKD starting 2 distinct doses of methotrexate vs those starting hydroxychloroquine.
This retrospective, population-based, new-user cohort study was conducted in Ontario, Canada (2008-2021) using linked administrative health care data. Adults aged 66 years or older with CKD (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 but not receiving dialysis) who started low-dose methotrexate (n = 2309) were matched 1:1 with those who started hydroxychloroquine.
Low-dose methotrexate (5-35 mg/wk) vs hydroxychloroquine (200-400 mg/d).
The primary outcome was a composite of serious adverse events: a hospital visit with myelosuppression, sepsis, pneumotoxic effects, or hepatotoxic effects within 90 days of starting the study drug. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted by eGFR category. Propensity score matching was used to balance comparison groups on indicators of baseline health. Risk ratios (RRs) were obtained using modified Poisson regression, and risk differences (RDs) using binomial regression.
In a propensity score-matched cohort of 4618 adults with CKD (3192 [69%] women; median [IQR] age, 76 [71-82] years), the primary outcome was higher in patients who started low-dose methotrexate vs those who started hydroxychloroquine (82 of 2309 [3.55%] vs 40 of 2309 [1.73%]; RR, 2.05 (95% CI, 1.42-2.96); RD, 1.82% [95% CI, 0.91%-2.73%]). In subgroup analysis, the risks increased progressively at lower eGFR (eg, eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2: RR, 2.79 [95% CI, 1.51-5.13]). In the secondary comparison with hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate users at 15 to 35 mg/wk had a higher risk of the primary outcome.
In this cohort of 4618 older patients with CKD, the 90-day risk of serious adverse events was higher among those who started low-dose methotrexate than those who started hydroxychloroquine. If verified, these risks should be balanced against the benefits of low-dose methotrexate use.",kidney disease

To evaluate the prevalence of RH and its association with clinical outcomes; the primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and the composite outcome was all-cause of mortality and morbidity in a cohort of patients with cardiorenal multimorbidity hospitalized in an internal medicine ward.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive hypertensive patients with cardiorenal multimorbidity. The composite outcome incorporated all-cause of in-hospital mortality and occurrence of sepsis, pulmonary embolism, acute coronary syndrome, stroke and renal replacement therapy.
We collected data in 141 inpatients with a mean age of 77 years ± 10 (males 65.9 %), estimated glomerular filtration rate of 34 ± 18.6 ml/min with length of stay of 17 ± 12 days. The prevalence of RH was 52.4%. In-hospital mortality was observed in 24 patients (17%) and the composite outcome occurred in 87 patients (61.7%) and among these 74 (85.1%) were patients with RH.

Traditionally, the management of anemia in CKD has been based on the use of replacement martial therapy, vitamin therapy, and the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). In recent years, alongside these consolidated therapies, new molecules known as hypoxia-induced factor prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) have appeared. The mechanism of action is expressed through an increased transcriptional activity of the HIF gene with increased erythropoietin production. The drugs currently produced are roxadustat, daprodustat, vadadustat, molidustat, desidustat, and enarodustat; among these only roxadustat is currently approved and usable in Italy. The possibility of oral intake, pleiotropic activity on martial and lipidic metabolism, and the non-inferiority compared to erythropoietins make these drugs a valid alternative to the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease in the nephrologist practice.",kidney disease

In this study, HK2 cells were treated with different concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce cell damage, and then the expressions of circ_0114428, microRNA-215-5p (miR-215-5p), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and western blot examined the Bax and Cleaved-caspase-3 proteins. Cell proliferation was detected by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay. And cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and the levels of inflammatory factors were detected by ELISA.
After LPS treatment with different concentrations, we found that LPS at 10 μg/mL had the best effect on HK2 cells. Circ_0114428 was highly expressed in sepsis-AKI patients and LPS-treated HK2 cells. Knockdown of circ_0114428 restored the effects of LPS treatment on proliferation, apoptosis and inflammatory response of HK2 cells. MiR-215-5p was a target of circ_0114428, and TRAF6 was a downstream target of miR-215-5p. Circ_0114428 regulated TRAF6 expression by sponging miR-215-5p in LPS-treated HK2 cells. Circ_0114428 regulated LPS-induced NF-κB signaling in HK2 cells by targeting miR-215-5p/TRAF6 axis.
Circ_0114428 knockdown abolished the cell proliferation, apoptosis and inflammatory damage in LPS-induced HK2 cells by targeting miR-215-5p/TRAF6/NF-κB.",kidney disease
Hyperaldosteronism Screening and Findings From a Large Diverse Population With Resistant Hypertension Within an Integrated Health System.,"['VictorKim', 'JiaxiaoShi', 'JaejinAn', 'SimranBhandari', 'Jeffrey WBrettler', 'Michael HKanter', 'John JSim']","Hyperaldosteronism (HA) is a common cause of secondary hypertension and may contribute to resistant hypertension (RH). The authors sought to determine and characterize HA screening, positivity rates, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) use among patients with RH.
A cross-sectional study was performed within Kaiser Permanente Southern California (7/1/2012-6/30/2017). Using contemporary criteria, RH was defined as blood pressure uncontrolled (≥ 130/80) on ≥ 3 medications or requiring ≥ 4 antihypertensive medications. The primary outcome was screening rate for HA defined as any aldosterone and plasma renin activity measurement. Secondary outcomes were HA screen positive rates and MRA use among all patients with RH. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratio (with 95% confidence intervals) for factors associated with HA screening and for patients that screened positive.
Among 102,480 patients identified as RH, 1977 (1.9%) were screened for HA and 727 (36.8%) screened positive for HA. MRA use was 6.5% among all patients with RH (22.5% among screened, 31.2% among screened positive). Black race, potassium < 4, bicarbonate > 29, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and systolic blood pressure were associated with HA screening, but only Black race (1.55 [1.20-2.01]), potassium (1.82 [1.48-2.24]), bicarbonate levels (1.39 [1.10-1.75]), and diastolic blood pressure (1.15 [1.03-1.29]) were associated with positive screenings.
The authors' findings demonstrate low screening rates for HA among patients with difficult-to-control hypertension yet a high positivity rate among those screened. Factors associated with screening did not always correlate with screening positive. Screening and targeted use of MRA may lead to improved blood pressure control and outcomes among patients with RH.",kidney disease
Clinical profile of re-hospitalizations in pediatric kidney and liver transplant recipients.,"['AdiShohet', 'NoaZiv', 'RachelGavish', 'OrlyHaskin', 'HadasAlfandary', 'OrithWaisbourd-Zinman', 'YaelMozer-Glassberg', 'IritKrause']","Solid organ transplantation has evolved in recent decades, resulting in a rise in patient and graft survival. Frequent hospitalizations affect graft function, patients' health, and quality of life. This study characterizes the frequency and causes of post-transplant hospitalizations among pediatric recipients.
This is a retrospective observational study evaluating pediatric kidney transplant recipients (KTR) and liver transplant recipients (LTR) aged 0-21 years, followed at a tertiary pediatric center in Israel from 2012 to 2017. Data were collected starting at 60 days post-transplantation. Diagnoses of admissions were based on clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings.
Forty-nine KTR experienced 199 all-cause re-hospitalizations (median number of re-hospitalizations per patient - 3 (IQR [interquartile range] 1-5.5), while 351 re-hospitalizations were recorded in 56 LTR (median - 5 [IQR 2-8.8]). Median follow-up time was 2.2 years for KTR (IQR 1-3.9) and 3 years for LTR (IQR 2.1-4.1). The most common cause for hospitalization for both cohorts was infection (50.8% and 62%, respectively). Gram-negative bacteria were the most common pathogens identified in KTR, while viral pathogens were more common in LTR (51% and 57% of pathogen-identified cases, respectively).
This is the largest study to describe rehospitalizations for pediatric solid organ recipients. The hospital admission rate was higher in LTR in comparison to KTR. Infections were the most common cause of hospitalization throughout the whole study period in both populations. Frequent hospitalizations impose a heavy burden on patients and their families; better understanding of hospitalization causes may help to minimize their frequency.",kidney disease
[ANMCO Scientific statement: Differences and similarities between direct oral anticoagulants - 10 years of scientific evidence and clinical practice].,"['Stefania AngelaDi Fusco', 'PietroScicchitano', 'MassimoGrimaldi', 'Michele MassimoGulizia', 'DomenicoGabrielli', 'FabrizioOliva', 'FurioColivicchi']","The advent of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has revolutionized the approach to thromboembolism prevention and treatment. The analysis of the evolution of the use of DOACs over the last decade has highlighted an overtaking in the DOAC use compared to vitamin K antagonists, with greater overall adherence to anticoagulant treatment and a reduction in ischemic events associated with atrial fibrillation. In clinical practice, particular attention should be paid to the use of the appropriate dosage based on the clinical characteristics of the individual patient, in order to avoid over- or under-treatment with a consequent increase in adverse event risk. In general, the four currently available DOACs have different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics that should be taken into consideration when choosing the drug and its dosage. This review summarizes differences and similarities of DOACs in complex clinical scenarios such as elderly patients, patients with chronic kidney disease, cancer patients, and multi-treated patients.",kidney disease

Conflicting results regarding the impact of NUC use and renal function have recently been reported.
To examine longitudinal changes in renal function according to the NUC treatment type compared with untreated patients METHODS: From 2014 to 2022, we retrospectively analysed 10,642 patients with CHB. The primary outcome was chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, which was defined as a minimum one-stage elevation. We applied propensity score (PS) matching for outcome comparisons.
In the PS-matched cohort of 1996 pairs, the NUC-treated group (7.6/100 person-years [PYs]) had a significantly higher CKD progression risk than the untreated group (4.4/100 PYs), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.70 (p < 0.001). The tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-treated group (7.9/100 PYs) showed a 1.76-fold increased CKD progression risk compared with the untreated group (4.5/100 PYs) in the PS-matched cohort (p < 0.001). Both the entecavir- and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)-treated groups showed CKD progression risks comparable to those of the untreated group in the PS-matched cohorts of 755 and 426 pairs, respectively (p = 0.132 and p = 0.120, respectively). No significant CKD progression risk was found between the entecavir- (6.0/100 PYs) and TAF-treated (5.2/100 PYs) groups in the PS-matched cohort of 510 pairs (p = 0.118).

Hence, the purpose of this salivary biomarker discovery study is to set the fundamentals for the realization of POC diagnostics for HFMD. Whole salivary proteome profiling was performed on the saliva obtained from children with HFMD and healthy children, using a reductive dimethylation chemical labeling method coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics technology. We identified 19 upregulated (fold change = 1.5-5.8) and 51 downregulated proteins (fold change = 0.1-0.6) in the saliva samples of HFMD patients in comparison to that of healthy volunteers. Four upregulated protein candidates were selected for dot blot-based validation assay, based on novelty as biomarkers and exclusions in oral diseases and cancers. Salivary legumain was validated in the Singapore (n = 43 healthy, 28 HFMD cases) and Taiwan (n = 60 healthy, 47 HFMD cases) cohorts with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.7583 and 0.8028, respectively.

Non-opioid pain management pathways for stone disease.,"['JacksonCabo', 'NicoleMiller']","New opioid dependency following urologic surgery is a serious adverse outcome that is well-described in the literature. Patients with stone disease often require multiple procedures due to recurrence of disease and hence are at greater risk for repeat opioid exposures. Despite this, opioid prescribing following urologic surgery remains highly variable and in an emergency setting, opioids are still used commonly in management of acute renal colic.
Two literature searches were performed using PubMed. Firstly, we searched available literature concerning opioid-sparing pathways in acute renal colic. Secondly, we searched available literature for opioid-sparing pathways in ureteroscopy and PCNL. Abstracts were reviewed for inclusion in our narrative review.
In the setting of acute renal colic, multiple randomized control trials have shown that NSAIDs attain greater reduction in pain scores, decreased need for rescue medications, and decreased vomiting events in comparison to opioids. NSAIDs also form a core component in management of post-ureteroscopy pain and have been demonstrated in randomized trials to have equivalent to improved pain control outcomes compared to opioids. Multiple opioid-free pathways have been described for post-ureteroscopy analgesia with need for rescue narcotics falling under 20% in most studies, including in patients with ureteral stents. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols following percutaneous nephrolithotomy are less well described but have yielded a reduction in post-operative opioid requirements.
In select patients, both acute renal colic and following kidney stone surgery, adequate pain management can usually be obtained with minimal or no opioid medication. NSAIDs form the core of most described opioid-sparing pathways for both ureteroscopy and PCNL, with the contribution of other components to post-operative pain outcomes limited due to lack of head-to-head comparisons. However, medications aimed specifically at targeting stent-related discomfort form a key component of most multi-modal post-surgical pain management pathways.",kidney disease
Contemporary Issues in Urothelial Carcinoma of Upper Urinary Tract.,"['JianpingZhao', 'Charles CGuo', 'PriyaRao']","Upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is an uncommon malignancy involving the renal pelvis and ureter. Careful pathologic analysis plays a critical role in the diagnosis and clinical management of UTUC. In combination with clinical and radiologic evaluation, pathologic features can be used to stratify patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. This risk stratification can help clinicians select the optimal treatment for patients with UTUC, such as kidney-sparing (conservative) treatment, radical nephroureterectomy or ureterectomy, and perioperative systemic therapy. However, due to the technical difficulty of obtaining sufficient tissue from the upper urinary tract, it is often challenging for pathologists to accurately grade the tumor and assess tumor invasion in small biopsy specimens. Although the majority of UTUCs are pure urothelial carcinoma, a considerable subset of UTUCs show histologic subtypes or divergent differentiation. Recent studies have identified genetically distinct molecular subtypes of UTUC by examining DNA, RNA, and protein expression profiles. The prognosis of pT3 UTUC, particularly renal pelvic UC, remains controversial, and several studies have proposed subclassification of pT3 UTUC. Lynch syndrome is a significant risk factor for UTUC, and screening tests may be considered in young patients and those with familial histories of the disease. Despite significant progress in recent years, several issues remain to be addressed in the pathologic diagnosis, molecular classification, and treatment of UTUC.",kidney disease

However, adequate current for successful DCCV is not yet established. Trans-myocardial current depends on two factors: input energy and transthoracic impedance (TTI). While factors affecting TTI have been studied in animal models, factors affecting TTI in humans have not been well established. Here we explored the potential factors that affect TTI in humans. Retrospective review of patients undergoing DCCV at a large quaternary medical center between October 2019 and August 2021 was conducted. Pertinent clinical information, including demographics, echocardiography findings, laboratory findings and body characteristics were collected. Cardioversion details including joules delivered and TTI were recorded by the defibrillator for each patient's first shock. Predictors of thoracic impedance were assessed using regression analysis. A total of 220 patients (29% female) were included in the analysis. 143 (65%) of the patients underwent DCCV for atrial fibrillation, 77 (35%) underwent DCCV for atrial flutter. Mean impedance in our population was 73 ± 18 ohms. In a regression model with high impedance defined as the upper quartile of our cohort, BMI, female sex, obstructive sleep apnea and chronic kidney disease (All p values <0.05) were significantly associated with high impedance. According to an ROC analysis, BMI has a high predictive value for high impedance, with an AUC of 0.76. In conclusion, our study reveals that elevated BMI, female sex, sleep apnea and chronic kidney disease were predictors of higher TTI. These factors may help in determining the appropriate initial shocking energy in patients undergoing DCCV for atrial fibrillation and flutter.",kidney disease
"Functional characterization of group Ⅱ interferon, IFNf in the acipenseriform fish, Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis).","['GuangyiDing', 'PeipeiYu', 'DanDeng', 'MengXie', 'KaiLuo', 'FuxianZhang', 'DingdaXu', 'QiaoqingXu', 'HuizhiGuo', 'ShuhuanZhang']","Teleost fish possess a diversity of type Ⅰ interferons (IFNs) repertoire, which play a crucial role in antiviral and antimicrobial immune responses. In our previous study, IFNe1-3 and IFNb were identified and cloned from Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis), an acipenseriform fish. However, the absence of Chinese sturgeon genome data has left the question of whether there are other type Ⅰ IFN members in this species unresolved. In this study, we have identified and characterized a novel IFN, IFNf in Chinese sturgeon (AsIFNf). Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the AsIFNf contains a unique disulfide bond (2 cysteines) located in the second exon and fifth exon region, distinguishing it from other reported teleost type I IFNs. Meanwhile, qPCR results showed that AsIFNf mRNA was detectable in all examined tissues and up-regulated in the spleen or kidney in response to poly I: C, Citrobacter freundii, and Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCV), but not by LPS. Furthermore, compared to recombinant AsIFNe2 protein (rAsIFNe2), rAsIFNf exhibited a stronger protective effect on Chinese sturgeon fin cells against SVCV and also induced higher expression of antiviral genes Mx and viperin. Importantly, AsIFNf displayed characteristics similar to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with a positive charge and demonstrated a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity in vitro. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the primitive structure and function of interferon, as well as deepening our comprehension of the innate immune system and disease defense in the endangered Chinese sturgeon.",kidney disease
"Biochemical, histological and transcriptomic analyses for the immunological organs provide insights into heat stress-induced disease susceptibility in Largemouth Bass.","['ZhichengXv', 'ShaoxiongChen', 'GuiliSong', 'HanHu', 'ShimeiLin', 'YongLong']","Aquaculture of Largemouth Bass (LMB, Micropterus salmoides), an economically important species, is badly affected by the outbreak of bacterial diseases in summer. However, the mechanisms underlying heat-induced disease susceptibility remain largely unknown. In this study, after exposure to 34 °C for 1, 7 and 14 d, the head kidney, spleen and blood of LMB were sampled for biochemical and histological assays to explore the effects of heat exposure on the oxidative and immunological indices. Compared to the controls maintained at 28 °C, chronic heat exposure (34 °C for 14 d) induced oxidative stress, caused cell apoptosis and decreased expression of the immunological genes in the head kidney and spleen tissues; and attenuated the blood immunological indices. Consistent with the impaired immunological functions, chronic heat exposure predisposed LMB to Aeromonas hydrophila infection and significantly (p < 0.001) increased tissue bacterial load. Furthermore, the effects of chronic heat exposure (heat), A. hydrophila infection (infection) and heat exposure followed by A. hydrophila infection (heat + infection) on gene expression in the head kidney and spleen of LMB were characterized by RNA sequencing. The results indicated that chronic heat exposure facilitated the bacteria-elicited changes in expression of the genes involved in a couple of metabolic and signaling pathways in both tissues. Upon heat + infection, the pathways involved in energy production and nutrients biosynthesis were enhanced, whereas those associated with the host cell functions such as cell-cell interactions and cell signaling were depressed. Our data provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying heat-induced disease susceptibility in LMB.",kidney disease

Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (RIRI) -related datasets were obtained from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes in RIRI were analyzed using R language, intersected with RIRI-related genes in the GeneCard database, and retrieved from the literature to finally obtain differential ferroptosis-related genes. An in vitro cell model of RIRI was constructed using mouse renal cortical proximal tubule epithelial cells (mRTEC cells) treated with hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R). Bioinformatic analysis showed that NR4A1 may be involved in RIRI through the induction of ferroptosis; in addition, we predicted through online databases that the downstream target gene of NR4A1, MDM2, could be targeted and regulated by ChIP and dual luciferase assays, and that NR4A1 could prevent MDM2 by inhibiting its NR4A1 was able to promote ferroptosis by inhibiting the ubiquitinated degradation of P53. NR4A1 expression was significantly increased in mRTEC cells in the hypoxia/reoxygenation model, and the expression of ferroptosis-related genes was increased in vitro experiments. NR4A1 reduces the ubiquitinated degradation of P53 by targeting the inhibition of MDM2 expression, thereby inducing ferroptosis and ultimately exacerbating RIRI by affecting the oxidative respiration process in mitochondria and producing oxidized lipids. This study presents a novel therapeutic approach for the clinical treatment of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury by developing drugs that inhibit NR4A1 to alleviate kidney damage caused by renal ischemia-reperfusion.",kidney disease

This reality presents multiple opportunities to plan for environmentally sustainable and quality kidney care. By placing a stronger emphasis on primary and secondary prevention of kidney disease and its progression, within the framework of universal health coverage, as well as empowering patients to enhance self-care, we can significantly reduce the need for costly and environmentally detrimental kidney replacement therapy.

De novo atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome associated with C3 gene mutation after kidney transplantation: a rare case of life-threatening diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in an adolescent.,"['Ji YeonSong', 'Seung HwanOh', 'YoungaKim']","Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) disease entity primarily attributed to genetic or acquired abnormalities in the alternative complement pathway. TMA can manifest in kidney transplant (KT) recipients owing to various factors, resulting in diverse clinical presentations. Given its adverse effects on allograft function and patient prognosis, genetic diagnostic approaches for aHUS are essential. Although rarely associated with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, only a few mild cases have been reported to date. In this report, we present a case of the patient who experienced recurrent and life-threatening diffuse alveolar hemorrhage shortly after KT accompanied by graft failure.
An 18-year-old girl who underwent deceased donor KT developed recurrent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage with acute kidney injury, leading to graft failure. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytes in blood smears suggested the presence of TMA. The patient underwent therapeutic plasma exchange, and clinical condition improved during the procedure. Genetic testing confirmed a heterozygous c.1273C>T mutation in C3 gene, leading to the diagnosis of aHUS. However, after discontinuing the plasma exchange, the patient experienced seizures, recurrent pulmonary hemorrhage, and oliguria with recurring TMA features. The patient subsequently underwent eculizumab treatment, which resulted in complete remission, although hemodialysis was continued after graft nephrectomy.
In patients presenting with unexplained pulmonary hemorrhage and kidney injury following KT, genetic aHUS should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis for TMA.",kidney disease

Additionally, artificial intelligence and big data analytics can be used to identify patients' treatment who are not receiving adequate care, highlighting care inefficiencies in the dialysis provider, optimizing patient outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs, and consequently creating values for all the involved stakeholders.
We present the results of a comprehensive survey aimed at exploring the attitudes of European physicians from eight countries working within a major hemodialysis network (Fresenius Medical Care) towards the application of Artificial intelligence in clinical practice.
An electronic survey on the implementation of artificial intelligence in hemodialysis clinics was distributed to 1,067 physicians. Of the 1,067 individuals invited to participate in the study, 404 (37.9%) professionals agreed to participate in the survey.
The survey showed that a substantial proportion of respondents believe that artificial intelligence has the potential to support physicians in reducing medical malpractice or mistakes.
While artificial intelligence's potential benefits are recognized in reducing medical errors and improving decision-making, concerns about treatment plan consistency, personalization, privacy, and the human aspects of patient care persist.

TWEAK/Fn14 signaling axis regulates renal inflammation and tubular cell death. However, the functional role of TWEAK/Fn14 in rhabdomyolysis remains unknown.
Rhabdomyolysis was induced in wild-type, TWEAK- and Fn14-deficient mice or mice treated with TWEAK blocking antibody. Renal injury, inflammation, fibrosis and cell death were assessed. Additionally, we performed in vivo and in vitro studies to explore the possible signalling pathways involved in Fn14 regulation.
Fn14 renal expression was increased in mice with rhabdomyolysis, correlating with decline of renal function. Mechanistically, myoglobin (Mb) induced Fn14 expression via ERK and p38 pathway, whereas Nrf2 activation diminished Mb-mediated Fn14 upregulation in cultured renal cells. TWEAK or Fn14 genetic depletion ameliorated rhabdomyolysis-associated loss of renal function, histological damage, tubular cell death, inflammation, and expression of both tubular and endothelial injury markers. Deficiency of TWEAK or Fn14 also decreased long-term renal inflammation and fibrosis in mice with rhabdomyolysis. Finally, pharmacological treatment with a blocking TWEAK antibody diminished the expression of acute renal injury markers and cell death and lessened residual kidney fibrosis and chronic inflammation in rhabdomyolysis.
TWEAK/Fn14 axis participates in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyolysis-AKI and subsequent AKI-CKD transition. Blockade of this signaling pathway may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for reducing rhabdomyolysis-mediated renal injury.

(5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide ameliorates diabetic kidney damage by inhibiting macrophage infiltration and its cross-talk with renal resident cells.,"['XuJianbin', 'DuPeng', 'ZhaoJing', 'AnXiaofei', 'FangYudie', 'ZhangJing', 'YangYanping', 'YangXiaorong', 'MuKaida', 'ZhangJinan']","Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the main cause of end-stage renal disease, and there are no targeted treatment options at present. The efficacy of the new immunosuppressive drug (5R)-5-hydroxytriptolide (LLDT8) in improving kidney inflammation has been demonstrated in multiple studies. The present study was intended to investigate the preventive and therapeutic effects of LLDT8 on DN and to reveal its potential pharmacological mechanisms.
The effects of LLDT8 on liver and kidney functions, and urine microprotein of Streptozotocin (STZ) induced DN mice were detected. The protective effect of LLDT8 on the kidney tissue was observed by pathological staining and transmission electron microscopy. Cell culture experiments were performed to detect the effects of LLDT8 on the expression of chemokines and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in high glucose-induced TCMK1 cells using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot (WB) techniques and to detect the influence of LLDT8 on the secretion of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors in high glucose-induced RAW264.7 cells.
In animal experiments, treatment with high-dose LLDT8 (0.25 mg/kg/2d) reduced 24 h urinary albumin excretion, improved structural kidney damage, and delayed fibrosis progression in DN mice. Immunofluorescence results showed that LLDT8 intervention reduced macrophage infiltration in kidney tissues of DN mice. PCR and WB results of kidney tissues showed reduced expressions of chemokines CCL2 and M-CSF1 in the LLDT8 intervention group compared to the DN group. In cellular assays, LLDT8 treatment reduced chemokine secretion in high glucose-induced TCMK1 cells, but had no effect on EMT of TCMK1 cells. LLDT8 treatment reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors in high glucose-induced RAW264.7 cells.
The present study suggests that LLDT8 could effectively inhibit the secretion of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic factors by macrophages, which could alleviate high glucose-induced renal tissue injury and slow down the process of tissue fibrosis and DN.",kidney disease

Unlike neoplastic forms, kidney damage in MGRS does not correlate with clone mass or circulating monoclonal protein levels, conferring unique pre-neoplastic or non-neoplastic properties to the responsible clones. This manuscript explores the heterogeneity of monoclonal proteins involved, varying from full immunoglobulins to free light chains (FLC), and how they result in a spectrum of kidney lesions with differing prognoses. We also elaborate on diagnostic challenges, emphasizing the indispensable role of kidney biopsy, including advanced techniques like laser microdissection and mass spectrometry (LMD/MS) for deposit characterization, particularly in ambiguous or complex cases.

How I Approach Light Chain Amyloidosis.,"['Raad BChowdhury', 'NelsonLeung']","Immunoglobulin Light Chain Amyloidosis (AL) is a progressive disease which leads to organ dysfunction and death. Tremendous progress has been made in staging, response, and treatment. The key to better survival though is early diagnosis which can be difficult since the symptoms are often nonspecific and can be seen in more common conditions. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, staging systems are available to provide prognosis on overall and renal survival. There are a number of treatments now available that are effective and well-tolerated. Response criteria have also been developed for hematologic and renal response in order to maximize response and minimize adverse effects. Newer therapies are being developed in particular anti-fibril therapies that are in clinical trials. For those patients who had a very good partial response or better, kidney transplantation may be an option if the kidney failure is not reversed.",kidney disease
[Onconephrology in Renal Transplant Patient: A Challenge for the Transplant Nephrologist].,"['EnricoSanna', 'Ana MariaManzione', 'SilviaMingozzi', 'LuigiBiancone']","Onconephrology, an emerging field in modern medicine, is gaining importance due to its intricate challenges derived from the mixing field of tumorous and renal diseases. The growing incidence of tumors in transplant patients requires preventive strategies and accurate monitoring. Pre-transplant screening is crucial, focusing on subjects with oncological history. Post-transplant follow-up must be personalized, tailoring screenings for patients with cancer history. Immunosuppressive therapy, although essential to prevent organ rejection, represents a delicate balance between controlling the immune response and cancer risk management. Immune checkpoint inhibitors emerge as a fascinating potential for cancer therapy, but their use in transplant patients requires caution and further research to carefully evaluate their safety and effectiveness, balancing potential benefits with actual risk of rejection. In summary, onconephrology is a growing field that requires an interdisciplinary approach and constant research, aimed at successfully addressing the complex challenges associated with oncological diseases in renal and transplant patients.",kidney disease
[Transplant Candidate with Cancer: Should We Proceed?].,"['GiacomoMascia', 'MatteoFloris', 'AndreaAngioi', 'DavideArgiolas', 'NicolaLepori', 'GianfrancaCabiddu', 'AntonelloPani']","Individuals who suffer from end-stage renal disease are at a higher risk of developing certain types of tumors. This risk increases as kidney function deteriorates further. Dialysis patients often witness a surge in the incidence of such malignancies. Interestingly, after the initial period following a kidney transplant, there is a dip in the number of deaths related to neoplasms. However, a long-term view reveals a progressive increase in the risk of developing tumors. The evaluation process for transplant candidacy is thorough, taking into account several factors, including the individual's history of neoplasms and the implications of immunosuppressive therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy is a double-edged tool in managing post-transplant complications, as it can foster environments conducive to neoplasm growth. It is essential to reevaluate, with the aid of an oncological opinion, the waiting time between cancer recovery and the listing for kidney transplantation, based on clinical data and follow-up. Independent of the type of tumor, the requirement to treat and achieve remission delays the listing process, consequently extending the time spent with end-stage renal disease and undergoing dialysis. These factors correlate with increased mortality, heightened risk of cardiovascular disease, and graft loss.",kidney disease

Advances in diagnostic techniques have enabled earlier and potentially less invasive interventions, however, this progress poses a challenge in managing low-malignancy tumors that were previously undiagnosed. To navigate treatment pathways, a deep understanding of the bidirectional relationship between Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is essential, influenced by risk factors such as hypertension and obesity. The debate between partial (PN) and radical nephrectomy (RN) continues to be fueled by a rich body of studies in the last two decades, aiming to determine the precise benefits of renal function preservation and overall survival. However, long-term monitoring remains inadequate. There is an urgent need for heightened clinical vigilance, urging meticulous periodic evaluations that include both eGFR and the urinary albumin-creatinine ratio, to identify potential deteriorations early. Furthermore, non-neoplastic renal parenchyma requires equal attention, often overshadowed by the assessment of tumor mass. A nuanced analysis is necessary to identify a range of nephropathies that guide more effective therapeutic strategies. A collaborative strategy that brings nephrologists, urologists, nuclear radiologists, oncologists, and pathologists together on a unified platform, focusing on a personalized medicine approach grounded on a profound analysis of individual risk factors, is pivotal in shaping the future of management and prevention strategies. This approach ensures a detailed therapeutic outlook and facilitates early interventions, marrying vigilance with interdisciplinary cooperation, thereby guarding against late diagnoses and offering patients a robust shield in their battle against kidney afflictions.",kidney disease
[Renal Side Effects of Novel Molecular Targeted Oncologic Agents].,"['RobertaFenoglio', 'SimoneCortazzi', 'MartinaMarchisio', 'GianlucaRabajoli', 'EdoardoTerzolo', 'SavinoSciascia', 'DarioRoccatello']","The introduction of innovative therapies has changed the scenario of complications. The delay in the recognition of kidney adverse effects is partly due to the timing of the development of the kidney damage which occurs later than the observation period of registration studies, and partly to the exclusion of patients with known kidney impairment from registration trials. Renal disease has a significant impact on the management of cancer patients and often leads to discontinuation of therapy. Histological evaluations of kidney disorders induced by targeted/immunotherapy are very limited. Renal biopsy is critical for the management of renal toxicities and should be especially encouraged for patients showing adverse renal effects to novel cancer agents. We recently examined the histological features of patients treated with new cancer agents who underwent renal biopsy for new onset renal failure and/or urinary abnormalities. The cohort included 42 patients. The most frequently administered therapies were immunotherapy (54.8%) and anti-angiogenic treatments (45.2%). The most common adverse effect was tubular interstitial nephritis in the first group and thrombotic microangiopathy in the second one. Based on histological findings, definitive discontinuation of treatment could be restricted to a very limited number of patients. All of them had anti-VEGF-related TMA. Treatment discontinuation was unneeded in patients treated with ICIs. In patients treated with multidrug therapy, the histological findings made it possible to identify the weight of drug-related specific injury. Based on this data, renal biopsy should be considered in every cancer patient who develops urinary abnormalities or shows a worsening of renal function during treatment with immunotherapy or targeted therapy.",kidney disease
[Chronic Kidney Disease and Cancer: Ethical Choices].,"['ChiaraLenoci', 'GinoGobber', 'GiulianoBrunori']","Cancer and chronic kidney disease prevalence both increase with age. As a consequence, physicians are more frequently encountering older people with cancer who need dialysis, or patients on dialysis diagnosed with cancer. Decisions in this context are particularly complex and multifaceted. Informed decisions about dialysis require a personalised care plan that considers the prognosis and treatment options for each condition while also respecting patient preferences. The concept of prognosis should include quality-of-life considerations, functional status, and burden of care. Close collaboration between oncologists, nephrologists, geriatricians and palliativists is crucial to making optimal treatment decisions, and several tools are available for estimating cancer prognosis, prognosis of renal disease, and general age-related prognosis. Decision regarding the initiation or the termination of dialysis in patients with advanced cancer have also ethical implications.

The potential mechanisms for the increased risk of cancer observed in CKD, include patient factors, disease, and treatment factors. CKD has also a major impact on the treatment of cancer patients. The kidney is the primary route of elimination of many anticancer drugs. Dosing of anticancer agents according to kidney function is essential to avoid undertreatment and toxicity. Because of the systemic exclusion of patients with severe kidney dysfunction from clinical cancer trials, data are lacking to guide dosing of anticancer drugs in patients with chronic kidney disease.

[Cancer and the Kidney: A Deadly Embrace].,"['DarioRoccatello', 'SimoneCortazzi', 'FrancescaBertinetto', 'AlessandraLa Rosa', 'LorenzoNescis', 'SavinoSciascia', 'RobertaFenoglio']","A deadly embrace occurs between cancer and chronic kidney disease. The estimation of kidney function in cancer patients is of utmost interest due to its direct impact on chemotherapy dosing, selection, and eligibility for chemotherapeutics. Overestimating kidney function (determined as estimated glomerular filtration rate -eGFR) can lead to overdosing and drug toxicity, while underestimating kidney function can prevent patients from receiving novel therapies. Notably, the current measures of eGFR are not validated in transplanted patients yet. The field of onconephrology ranges from nephrotoxicity of existing and novel therapeutics, paraproteinemias, and cancer-associated electrolyte imbalance, fluid and acid-base disturbances, the effects of the destruction of cancer cells, and acute and/or chronic kidney injuries. Recently, the therapeutic armamentarium has been enriched with new agents that interfere with specific proteins involved in oncogenesis. These are the so-called target therapies, which although acquired as ""targeted"" therapies do not have absolute specificity and selectivity and tend to inhibit multiple targets, often involving the kidney. Renal biopsy may be critical in managing these adverse effects. Moreover, primary hematological and oncological disorders can have significant kidney implications in the form of glomerular or nonglomerular diseases presenting with proteinuria, hematuria, hypertension, and kidney function decline, specifically including cast nephropathy or systemic light chain amyloidosis, and paraneoplastic glomerulopathies that occur as a result of occult malignancy, such as Membranous Nephropathy and Minimal Change disease.",kidney disease

In connection with the case presentation, we would like to sum up the dangers of excessive vitamin D supplementation, and to draw attention to the shortcomings experienced in everyday medical practice. We discuss the tests required to create a diagnosis of vitamin D intoxication, the differential diagnosis, and present the possible treatment strategies. A 57-year-old female patient was admitted to hospital in November 2020 due to complaints of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and general weakness. Upon admission, laboratory tests confirmed new-onset kidney damage (eGFR 38 mL/min/1.73 m2), calcium metabolism was not checked. During non-invasive investigations, urinary sediment results showed leukocyturia and non-nephrotic proteinuria, but no clear underlying cause was found. Nephrology consultation suggested acute tubular injury, kidney biopsy was performed, immune serology and serum protein electrophoresis tests were ordered. Despite conservative treatment, her kidney function deteriorated further (eGFR 32 mL/d/1.73 m2). The patient arrived at our department in December 2020 with histological results in progress. Laboratory tests taken on arrival confirmed severe hypercalcemia (tCa 3.22 mmol/L, iCa 1.74 mmol/L), and kidney function was stable (eGFR 33 mL/p/1.73 m2). Intact parathyroid hormone level was below the normal range (0.54 pmol/L), 25-OH-vitamin D level was extremely high (1106.2 nmol/L). The patient then admitted that in October 2020, she received a course of ""megadose"" parenteral vitamin D, but she could not recall the exact dosage nor wanted to mention the department administering the treatment. We diagnosed vitamin D intoxication. Intravenous saline, furosemide and calcitonin treatment was started. The result of the treatment: serum calcium level normalized (2.52 mmol/L), and kidney functions improved (eGFR 54 mL/p/1.73 m2). Vitamin D treatment was stopped. The patients' serum tCa and vitamin D levels normalized by February 2021, and her kidney functions improved (tCa 2.54 mmol/L, 25-OH-vitamin D 125.0 ng/mL, eGFR 72 mL/p/1.73 m2).

APOBEC3C is a novel target for the immune treatment of lower-grade gliomas.,"['ShufaZhao', 'YuntaoLi', 'JieXu', 'LiangShen']","Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) type 3C (A3C) has been identified as a cancer molecular biomarker in the past decade. However, the practical role of A3C in lower-grade gliomas (LGGs) in improving the clinical outcome remains unclear. This study aims to discuss the function of A3C in immunotherapy in LGGs.
The RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) and corresponding clinical data were extracted from UCSC Xena and the results were verified in the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used for screening A3C-related genes. Comprehensive bioinformation analyses were performed and multiple levels of expression, survival rate, and biological functions were assessed to explore the functions of A3C.
A3C expression was significantly higher in LGGs than in normal tissues but lower than in glioblastoma (GBM), indicating its role as an independent prognosis predictor for LGGs. Twenty-eight A3C-related genes were found with WGCNA for unsupervised clustering analysis and three modification patterns with different outcomes and immune cell infiltration were identified. A3C and the A3C score were also correlated with immune cell infiltration and the expression of immune checkpoints. In addition, the A3C score was correlated with increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. Single-cell RNA (scRNA) analysis indicated that A3C most probably expresses on immune cells, such as T cells, B cells and macrophage.
A3C is an immune-related prognostic biomarker in LGGs. Developing drugs to block A3C could enhance the efficiency of immunotherapy and improve disease survival.",kidney disease

This retrospective cohort study included patients with type 4 CRS and ESRD admitted for decompensated heart failure between January 2016 and December 2021. Patients were divided into the rhBNP and non-rhBNP cohorts, according to whether they were prescribed rhBNP. The primary outcomes were emergency dialysis at first admission and cardiovascular events within a month after discharge. A total of 77 patients were included in the rhBNP cohort (49 males and 28 females, median age 67) and 79 in the non-rhBNP cohort (47 males and 32 females, median age 68). After adjusting for age, residual renal function, and primary diseases, Cox regression analysis showed that rhBNP was associated with emergency dialysis (HR = 0.633, 95% CI 0.420-0.953) and cardiovascular events (HR = 0.410, 95% CI 0.159-0.958). In addition, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (OR = 0.782, 95% CI 0.667-0.917, P = 0.002) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels (OR = 1.788, 95% CI 1.193-2.680, P = 0.005) at the first visit were independent risk factors for emergency dialysis while using rhBNP was a protective factor for emergency dialysis (OR = 0.195, 95% CI 0.084-0.451, P < 0.001).

Acetyl-CoA is a key molecule for nephron progenitor cell pool maintenance.,"['FabiolaDiniz', 'Nguyen Yen NhiNgo', 'MarielColon-Leyva', 'FrancescaEdgington-Giordano', 'SylviaHilliard', 'KevinZwezdaryk', 'JiaoLiu', 'Samir SEl-Dahr', 'Giovane GTortelote']","Nephron endowment at birth impacts long-term renal and cardiovascular health, and it is contingent on the nephron progenitor cell (NPC) pool. Glycolysis modulation is essential for determining NPC fate, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Combining RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics we identify 267 genes commonly targeted by Wnt activation or glycolysis inhibition in NPCs. Several of the impacted pathways converge at Acetyl-CoA, a co-product of glucose metabolism. Notably, glycolysis inhibition downregulates key genes of the Mevalonate/cholesterol pathway and stimulates NPC differentiation. Sodium acetate supplementation rescues glycolysis inhibition effects and favors NPC maintenance without hindering nephrogenesis. Six2Cre-mediated removal of ATP-citrate lyase (Acly), an enzyme that converts citrate to acetyl-CoA, leads to NPC pool depletion, glomeruli count reduction, and increases Wnt4 expression at birth. Sodium acetate supplementation counters the effects of Acly deletion on cap-mesenchyme.

Multi-site microbiota alteration is a hallmark of kidney stone formation.,"['Kait FAl', 'Benjamin RJoris', 'Brendan ADaisley', 'John AChmiel', 'JenniferBjazevic', 'GregorReid', 'Gregory BGloor', 'John DDenstedt', 'HassanRazvi', 'Jeremy PBurton']","Inquiry of microbiota involvement in kidney stone disease (KSD) has largely focussed on potential oxalate handling abilities by gut bacteria and the increased association with antibiotic exposure. By systematically comparing the gut, urinary, and oral microbiota of 83 stone formers (SF) and 30 healthy controls (HC), we provide a unified assessment of the bacterial contribution to KSD.
Amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing approaches were consistent in identifying multi-site microbiota disturbances in SF relative to HC. Biomarker taxa, reduced taxonomic and functional diversity, functional replacement of core bioenergetic pathways with virulence-associated gene markers, and community network collapse defined SF, but differences between cohorts did not extend to oxalate metabolism.
We conclude that multi-site microbiota alteration is a hallmark of SF, and KSD treatment should consider microbial functional restoration and the avoidance of aberrant modulators such as poor diet and antibiotics where applicable to prevent stone recurrence. Video Abstract.",kidney disease

Systolic blood pressure and total time on renal replacement therapy (RRT) were controlled statistically. Associations between performance and clinical factors were analyzed using correlations and multiple regression.
The DP group showed better performance compared to the HD group in verbal fluency, working memory, cognitive flexibility, planning and decision making. The DP group showed worse execution than the HP group in verbal inhibition and memory. Executive function scores were positively associated with total months on PD, total months on RRT, total months on HD, albumin, total cholesterol, and phosphorus, and negatively with ferritin.
Global executive functioning was more optimal in PD patients than in HD patients. The results show the positive effect of PD on executive functions, which must be taken into account when choosing the TRS.

By this review, we demonstrate the capability and clinical potential of the imaging methods, with the hope of accelerating their adoption to clinical practice.",kidney disease
"Efficacy and safety of telitacicept in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a multicentre, retrospective, real-world study.","['Hui-ZhiJin', 'Yu-JingLi', 'XinWang', 'ZhijunLi', 'BinMa', 'LinNiu', 'PengWang', 'Hai-FengPan', 'Si-DongLi', 'WeiBao', 'GuoshengWang', 'Xiao-MeiLi', 'ZhuChen']","To examine the efficacy and safety of telitacicept in the treatment of patients with SLE in everyday clinical practice.
Seventy-two patients with active SLE who received telitacicept for more than 24 weeks at multiple centres in China between 2019 and 2022 were retrospectively identified. Twenty-one of these patients received 52 continuous weeks of treatment with telitacicept. Treatment outcomes were analysed separately according to whether patients had renal or haematological abnormalities. Trajectory analysis was performed to identify patients with a limited response. Factors contributing to a limited response were explored by multivariable logistic regression analysis.
After treatment with telitacicept for 4, 12, 24 and 52 weeks, 22.22%, 54.17%, 72.22% and 80.95% of patients, respectively, achieved an SLE Responder Index 4; 8.33%, 26.39%, 34.72% and 47.62% achieved a Lupus Low Disease Activity State; and 0%, 4.17%, 8.33% and 23.81% achieved remission. Significant decreases in serum IgA, IgG and IgM levels were observed at 4 weeks and showed a downward trend at 12, 24 and 52 weeks. The median 24-hour urinary protein declined from 1323.5 mg to 224.0 mg in patients with lupus nephritis after treatment with telitacicept for 52 weeks. Furthermore, a large proportion of patients (10 of 13) with haematological abnormalities recovered after 52 weeks of treatment with telitacicept. No severe adverse events were reported during the observation period. Age appeared to have a negative impact on treatment efficacy.
Telitacicept demonstrated favourable efficacy and safety in patients with active SLE and improved the renal and haematological manifestations of the disease.",kidney disease
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Commentary on the Phosphorus Recommendation in the KDOQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in CKD: 2020 Update.,"['Joyce MarcleyVergili', 'Gabriela VProaño', 'Elizabeth YakesJimenez', 'LisaMoloney', 'ConstantinaPapoutsakis', 'AlisonSteiber']","The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): 2020 Update recommends adjusting dietary phosphorus to maintain a serum phosphate goal for hemodialysis patients in the normal range (0.81 to 1.45 mmol/L [2.5 to 4.5 mg/dL]). This is lower than the serum phosphate goal used by many dialysis centers (0.97 to 1.78 mmol/L [3.0 and 5.5 mg/dL]). Although context and clinical judgement must always be considered when providing individualized care to patients, a guideline implementation study conducted from December 2020 to December 2022 found that, based on their documentation, registered dietitian nutritionists from two national dialysis chains are almost universally using dialysis center goals instead of the lower phosphate goal recommended by the guideline. This commentary discusses the possible barriers to implementing the KDOQI 2020 nutrition guideline's phosphorus recommendation and proposes a systems level approach to promote and support adoption of the recommendation. Calls to action for potential changes in clinician practices, organizational/institutional culture, and government regulations are put forth.",kidney disease
Neuronal damage and inflammatory biomarkers are associated with the affective and chronic fatigue-like symptoms due to end-stage renal disease.,"['Hussein KadhemAl-Hakeim', 'Basim Abd Al-RaheemTwai', 'Tabarek HadiAl-Naqeeb', 'Shatha RoufMoustafa', 'MichaelMaes']","Many biochemical, immunological, and neuropsychiatric changes are associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Neuronal damage biomarkers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), neurofilament light chain (NFL), S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1 (IBA1), and myelin basic protein (MBP) are among the less-studied biomarkers of ESRD.
We examined the associations between these neuro-axis biomarkers, inflammatory biomarkers, e.g., C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL-6), IL-10, and zinc, copper, and neuropsychiatric symptoms due to ERSD.
ELISA techniques were used to measure serum levels of neuronal damage biomarkers in 70 ESRD patients, and 46 healthy controls.
ESRD patients have higher scores of depression, anxiety, fatigue, and physiosomatic symptoms than healthy controls. Aberrations in kidney function tests and the number of dialysis interventions are associated with the severity of depression, anxiety, fibro-fatigue and physiosomatic symptoms, peripheral inflammation, nestin, and NFL. Serum levels of neuronal damage biomarkers (NFL, MBP, and nestin), CRP, and interleukin (IL)-10 are elevated, and serum zinc is decreased in ESRD patients as compared with controls. The neuronal damage biomarkers NFL, nestin, S100B and MBP are associated with the severity of one or more neuropsychiatric symptom domains. Around 50 % of the variance in the neuropsychiatric symptoms is explained by NFL, nestin, S00B, copper, and an inflammatory index.
The severity of renal dysfunction and/or the number of dialysis interventions may induce peripheral inflammation and, consequently, neurotoxicity to intermediate filament proteins, astrocytes, and the blood-brain barrier, leading to the neuropsychiatric symptoms of ESRD.",kidney disease
Proteinuria selectivity index in renal disease.,"['WenLiu', 'Zhi-HangSu', 'Qi-JunWan']","One of the main barriers to early detection and subsequent prevention of kidney diseases is the accessibility and feasibility of testing, especially in urine research. The proteinuria selectivity index (PSI or SI) is a method used to assess changes in glomerular permeability in glomerular diseases. It describes the pattern of proteinuria by comparing the clearance rates of large molecular proteins and transferrin, categorizing it as selective or non-selective. PSI is widely applied for kidney disease classification, prediction of corticosteroid efficacy, and prognosis. Herein, we reviewed the clinical applications and recent advancements of PSI in glomerular diseases, compared it with commonly used renal function biomarkers, and discussed the future research directions for PSI as a potential predictive marker for response to specific biologics.",kidney disease
CD4 is an important host factor for Japanese encephalitis virus entry and replication in PK-15 cells.,"['QiWang', 'ShuqingYang', 'KeYang', 'XinranLi', 'YuDai', 'YiZheng', 'SanjieCao', 'QiguiYan', 'XiaoboHuang', 'YipingWen', 'QinZhao', 'SenyanDu', 'YifeiLang', 'ShanZhao', 'RuiWu']","Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a flavivirus that is spread through mosquito bites and is the leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. JEV can infect a variety of cell types; however, crucial receptor molecules remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether porcine CD4 protein is a receptor protein that impacts JEV entry into PK15 cells and subsequent viral replication. We confirmed the interaction between the JEV E protein and the CD4 protein through Co-IP, virus binding and internalization, antibody blocking, and overexpression and created a PK-15 cell line with CD4 gene knockdown by CRISPR/Cas9. The results show that CD4 interacts with JEV E and that CD4 knockdown cells altered virus adsorption and internalization, drastically reducing virus attachment. The level of viral transcription in CD4 antibody-blocked cells, vs. control cells, was decreased by 49.1%. Based on these results, we believe that CD4 is a receptor protein for JEVs. Furthermore, most viral receptors appear to be associated with lipid rafts, and colocalization studies demonstrate the presence of CD4 protein on lipid rafts. RT‒qPCR and WB results show that virus replication was suppressed in PK-15-CD4",kidney disease
Sex-dependent effects of finerenone on hemostasis in normoglycemic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.,"['BielickaNatalia', 'MisztalTomasz', 'ChabielskaEwa', 'Gromotowicz-PopławskaAnna']","Diabetes is associated with aldosterone excess and the overactivation of its mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) which leads to the development of many cardiovascular dysfunctions. Therefore, MR antagonists have been found to exert favorable effects on the cardiovascular system. Finerenone is a new nonsteroidal MR antagonist approved for the treatment of chronic kidney disease associated with type 2 diabetes. Clinical studies have demonstrated that finerenone improves cardiovascular outcomes. However, its influence on hemostasis in the cardioprotective effect is unknown. Therefore, the main aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of finerenone (10 mg/kg, p.o.) on selected hemostasis parameters in streptozotocin (180 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced diabetes. Since regulation of the MR activity is sex-dependent, the study was conducted in both female and male mice. The most beneficial effects of finerenone were observed in diabetic female mice which included a decrease in thrombus formation, attenuation of platelet activity, inhibition of the coagulation system, and activation of fibrinolysis. In contrast, in male diabetic mice only an attenuation of the coagulation system was observed. Furthermore, finerenone also exerted unfavorable effects, but only in normoglycemic mice, manifested as a slight increase in platelet activity in males and an enhancement of the coagulation system activity in females. Our study is the first to show the sex-dependent and glycemia-dependent effects of finerenone on hemostasis in diabetes. The occurrence of beneficial effects only in female diabetic mice requires in-depth study.",kidney disease
Practical Prediction of New Baseline Renal Function After Partial Nephrectomy.,"['NityamRathi', 'WorapatAttawettayanon', 'AkiraKazama', 'YosukeYasuda', 'CarlosMunoz-Lopez', 'KieranLewis', 'EranMaina', 'AndrewWood', 'Diego APalacios', 'JianboLi', 'NourAbdallah', 'Christopher JWeight', 'MohamedEltemamy', 'VenkateshKrishnamurthi', 'RobertAbouassaly', 'Steven CCampbell']","Partial nephrectomy (PN) is generally preferred for localized renal masses due to strong functional outcomes. Accurate prediction of new baseline glomerular filtration rate (NBGFR) after PN may facilitate preoperative counseling because NBGFR may affect long-term survival, particularly for patients with preoperative chronic kidney disease. Methods for predicting parenchymal volume preservation, and by extension NBGFR, have been proposed, including those based on contact surface area (CSA) or direct measurement of tissue likely to be excised/devascularized during PN. We previously reported that presuming 89% of global GFR preservation (the median value saved from previous, independent analyses) is as accurate as the more subjective/labor-intensive CSA and direct measurement approaches. More recently, several promising complex/multivariable predictive algorithms have been published, which typically include tumor, patient, and surgical factors. In this study, we compare our conceptually simple approach (NBGFR
A total of 631 patients with bilateral kidneys who underwent PN at Cleveland Clinic (2012-2014) for localized renal masses with available preoperative/postoperative GFR were analyzed. NBGFR was defined as the final GFR 3-12 months post-PN. Predictive accuracies were assessed from correlation coefficients (r) and mean squared errors (MSE).
Our conceptually simple approach based on uniform 90% functional preservation had equivalent r values when compared with complex, multivariable models, and had the lowest degree of error when predicting NBGFR post-PN.
Our simple formula performs equally well as complex algorithms when predicting NBGFR after PN. Strong anchoring by preoperative GFR and minimal functional loss (≈ 10%) with the typical PN likely account for these observations. This formula is practical and can facilitate counseling about expected postoperative functional outcomes after PN.",kidney disease

This cross-sectional study included 245 and 39 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and non-T2DM (NDM), respectively. The participants of this study were fitted with retrospective CGM, and glycemic control indices, such as time in range (TIR) and glycemia risk index (GRI), were calculated.
The results were presented as medians (interquartile ranges). The uL-FABP/Cr was significantly higher in the microalbuminuria than in the normo-albuminuria group [4.2 (2.7-7.1) and 2.2 (1.4-3.4) μg/gCr, respectively, P < 0.001], while the uNAG/Cr in the normo-albuminuria group [6.3 (4.5-10.1) U/gCr] was significantly higher than that in the NDM group [5.3 (3.8-6.3) U/gCr, P = 0.048] but significantly lower than that in the microalbuminuria group [9.2 (6.4-11.1) U/gCr, P = 0.004].

Age at COVID-19 death has been lower in Mexico than in high-income countries, presumably because of the young demographics and high prevalence of chronic metabolic diseases in young and middle-aged adults. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination covered 85% of adults with at least one dose and 50% with booster(s) up to April 2022. No new vaccination efforts or updated boosters were introduced until October 2023; thus, we explored the public health impact of massive SARS-CoV-2 vaccination against ancestral strains and asked whether their real-world protection has persisted through time. We compared three periods with respect to vaccine roll-outs: before, during and after vaccine introduction in a national retrospective cohort of >7.5 million COVID-19 cases. The main findings were that after vaccination, COVID-19 mortality decreased, age at COVID-19 death increased by 5-10 years, both in populations with and without comorbidities; obesity stopped being a significant risk factor for COVID-19 death and protection against severe disease persisted for a year after boosters, including at ages 60-79 and 80+.

Transplantation from a CMV-seropositive donor to a CMV-seronegative recipient (D+/R-) is associated with high risk of CMV disease. However, that risk is not uniform, suggesting a role for host factors in immune control of CMV. To identify host genetic factors that control CMV DNAemia post transplantation, we performed a whole-exome association study in two cohorts of D+/R- kidney transplant recipients. Quantitative CMV DNA was measured for at least one year following transplantation. Several CMV-protective single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the first cohort (72 patients) but were not reproducible in the second cohort (126 patients).

Vaccination and Antiviral Treatment Reduce the Time to Negative SARS-CoV-2 Swab: A Real-Life Study.,"['AndreaDe Vito', 'GiuliaMoi', 'LauraSaderi', 'Mariangela VPuci', 'AgneseColpani', 'LauraFirino', 'AnnaPuggioni', 'SergioUzzau', 'SergioBabudieri', 'GiovanniSotgiu', 'GiordanoMadeddu']","Clinical trials demonstrated the role of vaccines and antiviral treatments against SARS-CoV-2 in reducing the likelihood of disease progression and death. However, there are limited data available regarding the time to negativity of people who received these treatments. Further, several comorbidities and risk factors might affect the impact of vaccines and antiviral treatments. To this end, we aimed to evaluate and disentangle the impact of anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments and that of underlying clinical factors associated with a shortened length of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hence, we recorded the timeframe of positive nasopharyngeal swab in people infected while being hospitalized for reasons other than SARS-CoV-2 infection. All patients who died or were discharged with a positive swab were excluded from the study. A total of 175 patients were included in this study. Clinical conditions encompass malignancies, immunological disorders, cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodegenerative, and chronic kidney disease. Most of the participants (91.4%) were vaccinated before admission to the hospital, and 65.1% received antiviral treatment within three days after the symptom's onset. Unvaccinated patients had a longer median time to negativity than people who received at least two doses of vaccine (18 vs. 10 days). Concerning the clinical conditions of all patients, multivariate analysis highlighted a lower probability of 14-day conversion of antigenic test positivity in patients with hematological malignancy, including those vaccinated and those exposed to antiviral therapies. In conclusion, our data showed that prompt administration of antiviral treatments accelerates the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Further, in the elderly patients under study, previous vaccination and antiviral treatment synergize to reduce time to negativity. This translates into a shorter hospitalization time and a lower risk of transmission through patients and connected healthcare workers in a hospital ward setting, with considerable improvement in cost-effective care management.",kidney disease

A panel comprising 17 circulating cytokines and vascular mediators was run on samples collected at different time points. The cytokine and mediator patterns were investigated via principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation-based network (CBN). In both groups, compared to their respective controls, COVID-19 was associated with higher levels of cytokines and vascular mediators. Differentiating between the KTRs and non-KTRs, the number of correlations was much higher in the non-KTRs (44 vs. 14), and the node analysis showed the highest interactions of NGAL and sVCAM-1 in the non-KTRs and KTRs (9 vs. 4), respectively.

The State of the Art on Graphene-Based Sensors for Human Health Monitoring through Breath Biomarkers.,"['Pedro CatalãoMoura', 'Paulo AntónioRibeiro', 'MariaRaposo', 'ValentinaVassilenko']","The field of organic-borne biomarkers has been gaining relevance due to its suitability for diagnosing pathologies and health conditions in a rapid, accurate, non-invasive, painless and low-cost way. Due to the lack of analytical techniques with features capable of analysing such a complex matrix as the human breath, the academic community has focused on developing electronic noses based on arrays of gas sensors. These sensors are assembled considering the excitability, sensitivity and sensing capacities of a specific nanocomposite, graphene. In this way, graphene-based sensors can be employed for a vast range of applications that vary from environmental to medical applications. This review work aims to gather the most relevant published papers under the scope of ""Graphene sensors"" and ""Biomarkers"" in order to assess the state of the art in the field of graphene sensors for the purposes of biomarker identification.

Our previous studies found CP could relieve diabetic nephropathy. Thus, we speculate that it might have a positive effect on diabetic testicular injury. In this study, a diabetic rat model was established, and then the rats were treated with CP for 8 weeks. We found that the levels of blood glucose, food, and water intake were reduced, and body weight was enhanced in diabetic rats after CP supplementation. Meanwhile, in CP treatment groups, the levels of male hormone and sperm parameters were improved, the pathological structure of the testicular tissue was repaired, and testicular fibrosis was inhibited. In addition, CP reduced the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines, and decreased oxidative stress and apoptosis in the testicular tissue. In conclusion, CP could ameliorate testicular damage in diabetic rats, as well as being a potential testicle-protective nutrient in the future to prevent the testicular damage caused by diabetes.",kidney disease

This consequently results in alterations in the expression of inflammatory markers and antioxidant genes. This study aimed to scrutinize the impact of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)-a key active component of green tea-on inflammation and oxidative stress in BALB/c mice exposed to water-pipe smoke. The experimental setup included a control group, a flavored water-pipe smoke (FWP) group, an unflavored water-pipe smoke (UFWP) group, and EGCG-treated flavored and unflavored groups (FWP + EGCG and UFWP + EGCG). Expression levels of IL-6, IL1B, TNF-α, CAT, GPXI, MT-I, MT-II, SOD-I, SOD-II, and SOD-III were evaluated in lung, liver, and kidney tissues. Histopathological changes were also assessed. The findings revealed that the EGCG-treated groups manifested a significant decline in the expression of inflammatory markers and antioxidant genes compared to the FWP and UFWP groups. This insinuates that EGCG holds the capacity to alleviate the damaging effects of water-pipe smoke-induced inflammation and oxidative stress. Moreover, enhancements in histopathological features were observed in the EGCG-treated groups, signifying a protective effect against tissue damage induced by water-pipe smoking. These results underscore the potential of EGCG as a protective agent against the adverse effects of water-pipe smoking.

"Spring Viremia of Carp Virus Infection Induces Carp IL-10 Expression, Both In Vitro and In Vivo.","['PingOuyang', 'YuTao', 'WenyanWei', 'QiunanLi', 'ShuyaLiu', 'YongqiangRen', 'XiaoliHuang', 'DefangChen', 'YiGeng']","Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine with both immune enhancement and immunosuppression activities, but the main role is immunosuppression and anti-inflammatory ability. In order to use the immunosuppressive function of IL-10, many viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, hepatitis B virus and EB virus, can evade the host's immune surveillance and clearance by increasing the expression of host IL-10. However, it has not been reported whether the aquatic animal infection virus can upregulate the expression of host IL-10 and the mechanisms are still unknown. Spring viremia of carp (SVC) is a fatal viral disease for many fish species and is caused by spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV). This disease has caused significant economic losses in the aquaculture industry worldwide. In this study, the expression of carp IL-10 with or without infection of SVCV in epithelioma papulosum cyprinid (EPC) cells, carp head kidney (cHK) primary cells and common carp tissues were analyzed using RT-PCR and ELISA. The results show that SVCV infection induced carp IL-10 mRNA and protein expression, both in vitro and in vivo. However, the upregulation of carp IL-10 by SVCV was hindered by specific inhibitors of the JAK inhibitor (CP-690550), STAT3 inhibitor (STA-21), NF-κB inhibitor (BAY11-7082) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) inhibitor (SB202190), but not JNK inhibitor (SP600125). Furthermore, the results demonstrated that JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, TYK2 and STAT5 played important roles in carp IL-10 production induced by SVCV infection. Taken together, SVCV infection significantly induced carp IL-10 expression and the upregulation trigged in JAK-STAT, NF-κB and p38MAPK pathways. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a fish infection virus upregulated the host IL-10 expression through the JAK-STAT, NF-κB and p38MAPK pathways. Altogether, fish viruses may have a similar mechanism as human or other mammalian viruses to escape host immune surveillance and clearance.",kidney disease

However, variations in results may arise due to factors such as genetics, dietary habits, and the strategy of anti-rejection therapy. Therefore, we conducted a 16S rRNA sequencing study to characterize intestinal microbiomes by using 75 fecal specimens obtained from 25 paired Chinese living donors (LDs) of kidneys and recipients before and after KT. Surprisingly, similar enterotypes were observed between healthy LDs and ESRD recipients. Nonetheless, following KT, the fecal communities of recipients exhibited distinct clustering, which was primarily characterized by Escherichia-Shigella and Streptococcus at the genus level, along with a reduction in the diversity of microbiota. To further explore the characteristics of gut microorganisms in early rejection episodes, two recipients with biopsy-proven borderline changes during follow-up were enrolled in a preliminary sub-cohort study. Our findings reveal a comparable construction of gut microbiota between ESRD patients and their healthy relatives while also highlighting the significant impact of KT on gut microbial composition.",kidney disease

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms linking CKD and ICM remain elusive. Our study aims to unravel these connections by integrating publicly available bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. Expression profiles from two ICM datasets obtained from heart tissue and one CKD with Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (CKD-PBMC) dataset were collected. We initiated by identifying shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ICM and CKD. Subsequent functional enrichment analysis shed light on the mechanisms connecting CKD to ICM. Machine learning algorithms enabled the identification of 13 candidate genes, including AGRN, COL16A1, COL1A2, FAP, FRZB, GPX3, ITIH5, NFASC, PTN, SLC38A1, STARD7, THBS2, and VPS35. Their expression patterns in ICM were investigated via scRNA-seq data analysis. Notably, most of them were enriched in fibroblasts. COL16A1, COL1A2, PTN, and FAP were enriched in scar-formation fibroblasts, while GPX3 and THBS2 showed enrichment in angiogenesis fibroblasts. A Gaussian naïve Bayes model was developed for diagnosing CKD-related ICM, bolstered by SHapley Additive exPlanations interpretability and validated internally and externally.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of febuxostat's mechanism of action, its effectiveness in gout management, its cardiovascular safety profile, renal and hepatic effects, musculoskeletal applications, safety considerations, and emerging research prospects. Febuxostat's primary mechanism involves selective inhibition of xanthine oxidase, resulting in reduced uric acid production. Its pharmacokinetics require personalized dosing strategies based on individual characteristics. In gout management, febuxostat offers a compelling alternative, effectively lowering uric acid levels, relieving symptoms, and supporting long-term control, especially for patients intolerant to allopurinol. Recent studies have demonstrated its cardiovascular safety, and it exhibits minimal hepatotoxicity, making it suitable for those with liver comorbidities. Febuxostat's potential nephroprotective effects and kidney stone prevention properties are noteworthy, particularly for gout patients with renal concerns. Beyond gout, its anti-inflammatory properties hint at applications in musculoskeletal conditions and a broader spectrum of clinical contexts, including metabolic syndrome. Emerging research explores febuxostat's roles in cardiovascular health, neurological disorders, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer therapy, driven by its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. Future directions include personalized medicine, combination therapies, mechanistic insights, and ongoing long-term safety monitoring, collectively illuminating the promising landscape of febuxostat's multifaceted therapeutic potential.",kidney disease

Obesity and Bone Mineral Density Protection Paradox in Chronic Kidney Disease: Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine as a Piece of the Puzzle?,"['AbdelazizGhanemi', 'FabriceMac-Way']","Obesity is a health condition that represents a risk factor for numerous diseases and complications. However, obesity might also have-to some extent-some ""benefits"" in certain situations. This includes potential bone protection in patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. In an attempt to explain such a paradox, we highlight secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) as a hypothetical mediator of this protection. Indeed, SPARC properties provide a logical rationale to describe such bone protection via its overexpression combined with its calcium-binding and collagen-binding properties. We believe that exploring such hypotheses could open new doors to elucidate unknown pathways towards developing a new generation of molecular therapies.",kidney disease
COVID-19 and Kidney: The Importance of Follow-Up and Long-Term Screening.,['VikrantRai'],"Renal involvement and kidney injury are common in COVID-19 patients, and the symptoms are more severe if the patient already has renal impairment. Renal involvement in COVID-19 is multifactorial, and the renal tubule is mainly affected, along with podocyte injury during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inflammation, complement activation, hypercoagulation, and crosstalk between the kidney and lungs, brain, and heart are contributory factors. Kidney injury during the acute phase, termed acute kidney injury (AKI), may proceed to chronic kidney disease if the patient is discharged with renal impairment. Both AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increase mortality in COVID-19 patients. Further, COVID-19 infection in patients suffering from CKD is more severe and increases the mortality rate. Thus, it is important to address both categories of patients, either developing AKI or CKD after COVID-19 or previously having CKD, with proper management and treatment. This review discusses the pathophysiology involved in AKI and CKD in COVID-19 infection, followed by management and treatment of AKI and CKD. This is followed by a discussion of the importance of screening and treatment of CKD patients infected with COVID-19 and future perspectives to improve treatment in such patients.",kidney disease

This retrospective cohort study used official National Healthcare System data on SARS-CoV-2 testing and vaccinations, demographics, and hospitalizations in the Province of Pescara, Italy, from 2 March 2020 to 31 December 2022. A total of 6541 (5.4%) reinfections and 33 severe and 18 lethal COVID-19 cases were recorded among the 121,412 subjects who recovered from a primary infection. There were no severe events following reinfection in the young population, whereas 1.1% of reinfected elderly died. A significantly higher reinfection risk was observed among females; unvaccinated individuals; adults (30-59 y); and subjects with hypertension, COPD, and kidney disease. Up to three years after a primary SARS-CoV-2 infection, the majority of the population did not experience a reinfection.

The Immunobiological Agents for Treatment of Antiglomerular Basement Membrane Disease.,"['MarinaYamashita', 'MamikoTakayasu', 'HiroshiMaruyama', 'KouichiHirayama']","Combination therapy with glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis is recommended as the standard treatment for anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease, but the prognosis of this disease remains poor. Several immunobiological agents have been administered or are expected to be useful for anti-GBM disease in light of refractory disease or the standard treatments' tolerability. Many data regarding the use of biologic agents for anti-GBM disease have accumulated, verifying the effectiveness and potential of biologic agents as a new treatment option for anti-GBM disease. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors were shown to be useful in animal studies, but these agents have no clinical use and were even shown to induce anti-GBM disease in several cases. Although the efficacy of the TNF-receptor antagonist has been observed in animal models, there are no published case reports of its clinical use. There are also no published reports of animal or clinical studies of anti-B-cell-activating factor, which is a member of the TNF family of agents. Anti-interleukin (IL)-6 antibodies have been demonstrated to have no effect on or to exacerbate nephritis in animal models. Anti-C5 inhibitor was observed to be useful in a few anti-GBM disease cases. Among the several immunobiological agents, only rituximab has been demonstrated to be useful in refractory or poor-tolerance patients or small uncontrolled studies. Rituximab is usually used in combination with steroids and plasma exchange and is used primarily as an alternative to cyclophosphamide, but there is insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy of rituximab for anti-GBM disease, and thus, randomized controlled studies are required.",kidney disease
How to Choose the Right Treatment for Membranous Nephropathy.,"['LuigiPeritore', 'VincenzoLabbozzetta', 'VeronicaMaressa', 'ChiaraCasuscelli', 'GiovanniConti', 'GuidoGembillo', 'DomenicoSantoro']","Membranous nephropathy is an autoimmune disease affecting the glomeruli and is one of the most common causes of nephrotic syndrome. In the absence of any therapy, 35% of patients develop end-stage renal disease. The discovery of autoantibodies such as phospholipase A2 receptor 1, antithrombospondin and neural epidermal growth factor-like 1 protein has greatly helped us to understand the pathogenesis and enable the diagnosis of this disease and to guide its treatment. Depending on the complications of nephrotic syndrome, patients with this disease receive supportive treatment with diuretics, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers, lipid-lowering agents and anticoagulants. After assessing the risk of progression of end-stage renal disease, patients receive immunosuppressive therapy with various drugs such as cyclophosphamide, steroids, calcineurin inhibitors or rituximab. Since immunosuppressive drugs can cause life-threatening side effects and up to 30% of patients do not respond to therapy, new therapeutic approaches with drugs such as adrenocorticotropic hormone, belimumab, anti-plasma cell antibodies or complement-guided drugs are currently being tested. However, special attention needs to be paid to the choice of therapy in secondary forms or in specific clinical contexts such as membranous disease in children, pregnant women and patients undergoing kidney transplantation.",kidney disease

The development of plaque complications, such as calcification and neo-angiogenesis, strongly impacts plaque stability and is a good predictor of mortality in patients with atherosclerosis. Despite well-known risk factors of plaque complications, such as diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. We and others have identified that the concentration of circulating leucine-rich α-2 glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) was increased in diabetic and chronic kidney disease patients. Using apolipoprotein E knockout mice (ApoE-/-) (fed with Western diet) that developed advanced atherosclerosis and using human carotid endarterectomy, we showed that LRG1 accumulated into an atherosclerotic plaque, preferentially in calcified areas. We then investigated the possible origin of LRG1 and its functions on vascular cells and found that LRG1 expression was specifically enhanced in endothelial cells via inflammatory mediators and not in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Moreover, we identified that LRG1 was able to induce calcification and SMAD1/5-signaling pathways in VSMC. In conclusion, our results identified for the first time that LRG1 is a direct contributor to vascular calcification and suggest a role of this molecule in the development of plaque complications in patients with atherosclerosis.",kidney disease

To predict and understand the implications of this complication, various blood and urine biomarkers have been proposed, including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 14 (CCL14), cystatin C, leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator (suPAR). This study, conducted between mid-January and early May 2021, aimed to assess the diagnostic and prognostic capabilities of these biomarkers in a cohort of COVID-19 patients monitored during the initial two weeks of hospitalization. Among the 116 patients included in this study, 48 developed AKI within the first three days of hospitalization (41%), with 29 requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and the overall mortality rate was 18%. AKI patients exhibited a statistically significant increase in urinary LAP levels, indicating acute tubular injury as a potential mechanism underlying COVID-19-related renal damage. Conversely, urinary NGAL and CCL-14 excretion rates did not differ significantly between the AKI and non-AKI groups. Importantly, elevated plasma suPAR and cystatin C levels upon admission persisted throughout the first week of hospitalization and were associated with unfavorable outcomes, such as prolonged ICU stays and increased mortality, irrespective of AKI development. In conclusion, this study underscores the early predictive value of urinary LAP levels in identifying acute tubular injury in COVID-19-induced AKI. Moreover, elevated plasma suPAR and cystatin C levels serve as valuable prognostic markers, offering insights into the short-term morbidity and mortality risks among COVID-19 patients, regardless of AKI occurrence. These findings shed light on the complex interplay between COVID-19, renal injury, and biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic potential.",kidney disease

The AKI-to-CKD Transition: The Role of Uremic Toxins.,"['CamilleAndré', 'SandraBodeau', 'SaïdKamel', 'YoussefBennis', 'PaulineCaillard']","After acute kidney injury (AKI), renal function continues to deteriorate in some patients. In a pro-inflammatory and profibrotic environment, the proximal tubules are subject to maladaptive repair. In the AKI-to-CKD transition, impaired recovery from AKI reduces tubular and glomerular filtration and leads to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Reduced kidney secretion capacity is characterized by the plasma accumulation of biologically active molecules, referred to as uremic toxins (UTs). These toxins have a role in the development of neurological, cardiovascular, bone, and renal complications of CKD. However, UTs might also cause CKD as well as be the consequence. Recent studies have shown that these molecules accumulate early in AKI and contribute to the establishment of this pro-inflammatory and profibrotic environment in the kidney.

SCARF Genes in COVID-19 and Kidney Disease: A Path to Comorbidity-Specific Therapies.,"['SolCarriazo', 'DariaAbasheva', 'DeborahDuarte', 'AlbertoOrtiz', 'Maria DoloresSanchez-Niño']","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has killed ~7 million persons worldwide. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the most common risk factor for severe COVID-19 and one that most increases the risk of COVID-19-related death. Moreover, CKD increases the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI), and COVID-19 patients with AKI are at an increased risk of death. However, the molecular basis underlying this risk has not been well characterized. CKD patients are at increased risk of death from multiple infections, to which immune deficiency in non-specific host defenses may contribute. However, COVID-19-associated AKI has specific molecular features and CKD modulates the local (kidney) and systemic (lung, aorta) expression of host genes encoding coronavirus-associated receptors and factors (SCARFs), which SARS-CoV-2 hijacks to enter cells and replicate. We review the interaction between kidney disease and COVID-19, including the over 200 host genes that may influence the severity of COVID-19, and provide evidence suggesting that kidney disease may modulate the expression of SCARF genes and other key host genes involved in an effective adaptive defense against coronaviruses. Given the poor response of certain CKD populations (e.g., kidney transplant recipients) to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and their suboptimal outcomes when infected, we propose a research agenda focusing on CKD to develop the concept of comorbidity-specific targeted therapeutic approaches to SARS-CoV-2 infection or to future coronavirus infections.",kidney disease

An Integrated Approach Using HLAMatchmaker and Pirche II for Epitopic Matching in Pediatric Kidney Transplant-A Romanian Single-Center Study.,"['Paul LuchianAldea', 'Maria DianaSantionean', 'AlinaElec', 'AdrianaMunteanu', 'OanaAntal', 'LuminitaLoga', 'TudorMoisoiu', 'Florin IoanElec', 'DanDelean', 'BogdanBulata', 'Andreea LianaRachisan Bot']","(1) Background: Renal transplantation (KT) is the most efficient treatment for chronic kidney disease among pediatric patients. Antigenic matching and epitopic load should be the main criteria for choosing a renal graft in pediatric transplantation. Our study aims to compare the integration of new histocompatibility predictive algorithms with classical human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching regarding different types of pediatric renal transplants. (2) Methods: We categorized our cohort of pediatric patients depending on their risk level, type of donor and type of transplantation, delving into discussions surrounding their mismatching values in relation to both the human leukocyte antigen Matchmaker software (versions 4.0. and 3.1.) and the most recent version of the predicted indirectly identifiable HLA epitopes (PIRCHE) II score. (3) Results: We determined that the higher the antigen mismatch, the higher the epitopic load for both algorithms. The HLAMatchmaker algorithm reveals a noticeable difference in eplet load between living and deceased donors, whereas PIRCHE II does not show the same distinction. Dialysis recipients have a higher count of eplet mismatches, which demonstrates a significant difference according to the transplantation type. Our results are similar to those of four similar studies available in the current literature. (4) Conclusions: We suggest that an integrated data approach employing PIRCHE II and HLAMatchmaker algorithms better predicts histocompatibility in KT than classical HLA matching.",kidney disease
Self-Reported Physical Inactivity and Mood Disturbances in End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) Patients on Chronic Dialysis Treatment.,"['MichelaMusolino', 'PierangelaPresta', 'PaolaCianfrone', 'Maria AntoniettaErrante', 'MicheleAndreucci', 'GiuseppeCoppolino', 'DavideBolignano']","Physical inactivity and mood disturbances are key issues in individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and may lead to poor clinical outcomes.
We performed a pilot, observational study to explore the possible relationships between the self-reported level of physical activity (IPAQ) and the severity of mood disturbances (BDI score) in a cohort of 58 ESKD patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD; 
Overall, ESKD patients were severely inactive (median METs: 590 [460-1850]) and the intensity of overall and walking physical activity was mostly low to moderate. HD individuals appeared less active than PD (METs 550 [250-1600] vs. 1080 [750-1730]; p = 0.003) and were also less prone to walking (METs 180 ± 90 vs. 320 ± 100; p = 0.01), while a barely statistical difference was noticed for the time spent sitting. ESKD individuals displayed a median BDI score of 17 [12-21], which indicated, on average, the presence of borderline depression, which was apparently more evident among HD individuals. A strong, inverse correlation was found between self-reported METs and BDI scores (R = -0.78; 
In ESKD patients on chronic dialysis, physical inactivity and mood disturbances might be significantly inter-connected, thereby amplifying their relative impact on quality of life, dysautonomia and long-term outcomes. Future studies on larger populations are recommended to confirm these preliminary observations. Promoting strategies to improve fitness, along with greater attention to physiological aspects, should be incorporated into the clinical management of ESKD patients.",kidney disease

Various genetic and acquired causes can be involved. A 65-year-old man was admitted because of refractory angina, which he had had since the age of 30 years, micro-hematuria, and recurrent transitory ischemic attacks from the age of 64.
Hematochemical studies, ECG, Holter monitoring, 2D-echo, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), CTA of cerebral vessels, endomyocardial coronary angiography, and kidney biopsy processes were undertaken. Gene mutation analysis was conducted using next-generation sequencing, which included more than 5000 genes associated with inherited diseases.
Hematochemical findings were unremarkable. The ECG, Holter, 2D-echo, and CTA of brain vessels were normal. Cerebral magnetic resonance showed the presence of multiple small foci of ischemia. Coronary and ventricular angiography showed normal arteries with remarkably slow flow and multiple biventricular micro-aneurysms. At the endomyocardial biopsy, five of seven arterioles presented severe lumen obstruction due to hypertrophy and disarray of the muscular coat. Similarly, obstructed pre-glomerular arteries with glomerular sclerosis were seen at the renal biopsy. Genetics identified mutations in the ABCC6, MMP2, and XYLT1 genes, which play pivotal roles in the extracellular matrix.

Cardiovascular Disease in Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease.,"['SowmyaSwamy', 'Sahibzadi MahrukhNoor', 'Roy OMathew']","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common occurrence in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), occurring in approximately 40% of cases. DM is also an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), but CKD is an important mediator of this risk. Multiple CVD outcomes trials have revealed a greater risk for CVD events in patients with diabetes with CKD versus those without. Thus, reducing the risk of CKD in diabetes should result in improved CVD outcomes. To date, of blood pressure (BP) control, glycemic control, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RASI), glycemic control appears to have the best evidence for preventing CKD development. In established CKD, especially with albuminuria, RASI slows the progression of CKD. More recently, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists (GLP1RA) have revolutionized the care of patients with diabetes with and without CKD. SGLT2i and GLP1RA have proven to reduce mortality, heart failure (HF) hospitalizations, and worsening CKD in patients with diabetes with and without existing CKD. The future of limiting CVD in diabetes and CKD is promising, and more evidence is forthcoming regarding combinations of evidence-based therapies to further minimize CVD events.",kidney disease

A Review of the Potential of Nuclear Factor [Erythroid-Derived 2]-like 2 Activation in Autoimmune Diseases.,"['IlkerAtes', 'Ayşe DidemYılmaz', 'BrigittaButtari', 'MarziaArese', 'LucianoSaso', 'SibelSuzen']","An autoimmune disease is the consequence of the immune system attacking healthy cells, tissues, and organs by mistake instead of protecting them. Inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) are well-recognized processes occurring in association with acute or chronic impairment of cell homeostasis. The transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor [erythroid-derived 2]-like 2) is of major importance as the defense instrument against OS and alters anti-inflammatory activities related to different pathological states. Researchers have described Nrf2 as a significant regulator of innate immunity. Growing indications suggest that the Nrf2 signaling pathway is deregulated in numerous diseases, including autoimmune disorders. The advantageous outcome of the pharmacological activation of Nrf2 is an essential part of Nrf2-based chemoprevention and intervention in other chronic illnesses, such as neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, and chronic kidney and liver disease. Nevertheless, a growing number of investigations have indicated that Nrf2 is already elevated in specific cancer and disease steps, suggesting that the pharmacological agents developed to mitigate the potentially destructive or transformative results associated with the protracted activation of Nrf2 should also be evaluated. The activators of Nrf2 have revealed an improvement in the progress of OS-associated diseases, resulting in immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory activities; by contrast, the depletion of Nrf2 worsens disease progression. These data strengthen the growing attention to the biological properties of Nrf2 and its possible healing power on diseases. The evidence supporting a correlation between Nrf2 signaling and the most common autoimmune diseases is reviewed here. We focus on the aspects related to the possible effect of Nrf2 activation in ameliorating pathologic conditions based on the role of this regulator of antioxidant genes in the control of inflammation and OS, which are processes related to the progression of autoimmune diseases. Finally, the possibility of Nrf2 activation as a new drug development strategy to target pathogenesis is proposed.",kidney disease
A Network Pharmacology and Molecular-Docking-Based Approach to Identify the Probable Targets of Short-Chain Fatty-Acid-Producing Microbial Metabolites against Kidney Cancer and Inflammation.,"['Md RezaulKarim', 'Md NiajMorshed', 'SafiaIqbal', 'ShahnawazMohammad', 'RamyaMathiyalagan', 'Deok ChunYang', 'Yeon JuKim', 'Joon HyunSong', 'Dong UkYang']","(1) Background: A large and diverse microbial population exists in the human intestinal tract, which supports gut homeostasis and the health of the host. Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-secreting microbes also generate several metabolites with favorable regulatory effects on various malignancies and immunological inflammations. The involvement of intestinal SCFAs in kidney diseases, such as various kidney malignancies and inflammations, has emerged as a fascinating area of study in recent years. However, the mechanisms of SCFAs and other metabolites produced by SCFA-producing bacteria against kidney cancer and inflammation have not yet been investigated. (2) Methods: We considered 177 different SCFA-producing microbial species and 114 metabolites from the gutMgene database. Further, we used different online-based database platforms to predict 1890 gene targets associated with metabolites. Moreover, DisGeNET, OMIM, and Genecard databases were used to consider 13,104 disease-related gene targets. We used a Venn diagram and various protein-protein interactions (PPIs), KEGG pathways, and GO analyses for the functional analysis of gene targets. Moreover, the subnetwork of protein-protein interactions (through string and cytoscape platforms) was used to select the top 20% of gene targets through degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality. To screen the possible candidate compounds, we performed an analysis of the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of metabolites and then found the best binding affinity using molecular docking simulation. (3) Results: Finally, we found the key gene targets that interact with suitable compounds and function against kidney cancer and inflammation, such as MTOR (with glycocholic acid), PIK3CA (with 11-methoxycurvularin, glycocholic acid, and isoquercitrin), IL6 (with isoquercitrin), PTGS2 (with isoquercitrin), and IGF1R (with 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine, isoquercitrin), showed a lower binding affinity.

Biomarkers Associated with Drugs for the Treatment of Lupus Nephritis.,"['HuiyuNie', 'SiyuanChang', 'YuanyuanLi', 'FenLi']","The constant updating of lupus drug treatment guidelines has led to a question. How can the efficacy of treatment be more effectively monitored? Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease that often presents clinically with multi-organ involvement, and approximately 30% of patients with SLE develop lupus nephritis (LN). Therefore, it is important to better track disease progression and drug efficacy. Now, kidney biopsy is still the gold standard for diagnosing and guiding the treatment of LN, but it is invasive and expensive. If simple, non-invasive and effective biomarkers can be found, drug intervention and prognosis can be better monitored and targeted.

Ginger Oil Nanoemulsion Formulation Augments Its Antiproliferative Effect in Ehrlich Solid Tumor Model.,"['Danah SAlharbi', 'Shouq FAlbalawi', 'Sarah TAlghrid', 'Basma SAlhwity', 'MonaQushawy', 'YasminMortagi', 'MohamedEl-Sherbiny', 'KousalyaPrabahar', 'NehalElsherbiny']","Cancer is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation. Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women. Ginger oil is a natural cancer fighter and anti-oxidant. However, the minimal absorption of ginger oil from the gastrointestinal tract accounts for its limited medicinal efficacy. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a nanoemulsion preparation of ginger oil on its oral bioavailability and in vivo anti-cancer efficacy. Ginger oil nanoemulsion was prepared by a high-pressure homogenization technique using different surfactants (Tween 20, 40, and 80). The prepared formulations were evaluated for droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential (ZP), pH, viscosity, and stability by calculating the creaming index percentage. The best formulation was evaluated for shape by TEM. The antitumor activity of the best nano-formulation was determined in comparison with the free oil using the in vivo Ehrlich solid tumor (EST) model. The prepared ginger oil nanoemulsion formulations exhibited acceptable droplet size in the range from 56.67 ± 3.10 nm to 357.17 ± 3.62 nm. A PDI of less than 0.5 indicates the homogeneity of size distribution. The oil globules possessed a negative charge ranging from -12.33 ± 1.01 to -39.33 ± 0.96 mV. The pH and viscosity were in the acceptable range. The TEM image of the best formulation appeared to be spherical with a small size. The ginger oil nanoemulsion reduced in vivo tumor volume and weight, extended animals' life span, and ameliorated liver and kidney function in EST-bearing mice. These effects were superior to using free ginger oil. Collectively, the present study demonstrated that the ginger oil nanoemulsion improved oral absorption with a subsequent enhancement of its anti-proliferative efficacy in vivo, suggesting a nano-formulation of ginger oil for better therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer patients.",kidney disease

data from four university hospitals in Germany, spanning from January 2017 to December 2021, were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 551 patients were included in the study, and various demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were compared.
demographic parameters did not exhibit any differences. However, the OPCAB group displayed notably higher rates of preoperative renal insufficiency, urgent surgeries, and elevated EuroScore II and STS score. During surgery, the ONCAB group showed a significantly higher rate of complete revascularization, whereas the OPCAB group required fewer intraoperative transfusions. No disparities were observed in 30-day/in-hospital mortality for the entire cohort and the matched population between the two groups. Subsequent to surgery, the OPCAB group demonstrated significantly shorter mechanical ventilation times, reduced stays in the intensive care unit, and lower occurrences of ECLS therapy, acute kidney injury, delirium, and sepsis.
the study's findings indicate that OPCAB surgery presents a safe and viable alternative, yielding improved postoperative outcomes in this specific patient population compared to ONCAB surgery. Despite comparable 30-day/in-hospital mortality rates, OPCAB patients enjoyed advantages such as decreased mechanical ventilation durations, shorter ICU stays, and reduced incidences of ECLS therapy, acute kidney injury, delirium, and sepsis.

Glucocorticoids are the gold standard therapy for iNS. Nevertheless, frequent relapses are common. In children with iNS, steroid-sparing agents are used to avoid prolonged steroid use and reduce steroid toxicity. Levamisole is one of these steroid-sparing drugs and although clinical effectiveness has been demonstrated, the molecular mechanisms of how levamisole exerts its beneficial effects remains poorly studied. Apart from immunomodulatory capacities, nonimmunological effects of levamisole on podocytes have also been suggested. We aimed to elaborate on the effects of levamisole on human podocytes in iNS. RNA sequencing data from a human podocyte cell line treated with levamisole showed that levamisole modulates the expression of various genes involved in actin cytoskeleton stabilization and remodeling. Functional experiments showed that podocytes exposed to puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), and NS patient plasma resulted in significant actin cytoskeleton derangement, reduced cell motility, and impaired cellular adhesion when compared to controls, effects that could be restored by levamisole. Mechanistic studies revealed that levamisole exerts its beneficial effects on podocytes by signaling through the glucocorticoid receptor and by regulating the activity of Rho GTPases. In summary, our data show that levamisole exerts beneficial effects on podocytes by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton in a glucocorticoid receptor-dependent manner.",kidney disease

Moreover, gut dysbiosis, inflammation, and an impaired immune response are emerging as crucial mechanisms in the disease pathology. The gut microbiome and kidney disease exert a reciprocal influence commonly referred to as ""the gut-kidney axis"" through the induction of metabolic, immunological, and endocrine alterations. Periodontal diseases are strictly involved in the gut-kidney axis for their impact on the gut microbiota composition and for the metabolic and immunological alterations occurring in and reciprocally affecting both conditions.

Renin is an aspartyl protease that catalyzes the first step of RAS and tightly regulates RAS activation. Here, we outline kidney renin expression and release under hypoxia and discuss the putative mechanisms involved. It is important that renin generally increases in response to acute hypoxemic hypoxia and intermittent hypoxemic hypoxia, but not under chronic hypoxemic hypoxia. The increase in renin activity can also be observed in anemic hypoxia and carbon monoxide-induced histotoxic hypoxia. The increased renin is contributed to by juxtaglomerular cells and the recruitment of renin lineage cells.

We present three autoimmune diseases mediated by different autoimmune mechanisms: glomerulonephritis in vasculitis mediated by anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), glomerulonephritis mediated by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies (anti-GBM antibodies), and immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. Some of these diseases represent a common clinical and histopathologic scenario, namely rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis. This is a severe illness requiring complex therapy, with the main role being played by therapy aimed at targeting immune mechanisms. In the absence of immune therapy, the crescents, the characteristic histopathologic lesions of this common presentation, progress toward fibrosis, which is accompanied by end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The fact that three diseases mediated by different immunopathologic mechanisms have a common clinical and histopathologic picture reveals the complexity of the relationship between immunopathologic mechanisms and their clinical expression. Whereas most glomerular diseases progress by a slow process of sclerosis and fibrosis, the glomerular diseases accompanied by glomerular crescent formation can progress, if untreated, in a couple of months into whole-nephron glomerulosclerosis and fibrosis. The outcome of different immune processes in a common clinical and histopathologic phenotype reveals the complexity of the relationship of the kidney with the immune system.

This immunotherapy showed a long-term clinical benefit mainly on renal function and better glycemic control but was also associated with a higher number of severe infectious diseases, particularly CMV disease, and lymphoproliferative disease. Therapeutic drug monitoring usually guides the benefit-risk assessment of long-term immunosuppression. In this study, an analytical method by LC-MS/MS was developed in 20 microL of plasma for the belatacept quantification. Intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy were lower than 20% for the limit of quantification, and 15% for higher concentrations. The method was implemented in our lab and provided data about the inter-variability (N = 108) and intra-variability (N = 33) of belatacept concentrations in kidney transplant recipients with a stable renal function, after conversion from a CNI- to a belatacept-based regimen.",kidney disease
"Thiobarbiturate-Derived Compound MHY1025 Alleviates Renal Fibrosis by Modulating Oxidative Stress, Epithelial Inflammation, and Fibroblast Activation.","['JeongwonKim', 'JieunLee', 'DahyeYoon', 'MinjungSon', 'Mi-JeongKim', 'SugyeongHa', 'DoyeonKim', 'Ji-AnYoo', 'DonghwanKim', 'Hae YoungChung', 'Hyung RyongMoon', 'Ki WungChung']","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a kidney structure and function abnormality. CKD development and progression are strongly influenced by oxidative stress and inflammatory responses, which can lead to tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no effective or specific treatments for CKD. We investigated the potential of the thiobarbiturate-derived compound MHY1025 to alleviate CKD by reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. In vitro experiments using NRK52E renal tubular epithelial cells revealed that MHY1025 significantly reduced LPS-induced oxidative stress and inhibited the activation of the NF-κB pathway, which is involved in inflammatory responses. Furthermore, treatment with MHY1025 significantly suppressed the expression of fibrosis-related genes and proteins induced by TGFβ in NRK49F fibroblasts. Furthermore, we analyzed the MHY1025 effects in vivo. To induce kidney fibrosis, mice were administered 250 mg/kg folic acid (FA) and orally treated with MHY1025 (0.5 mg/kg/day) for one week. MHY1025 effectively decreased the FA-induced inflammatory response in the kidneys. The group treated with MHY1025 exhibited a significant reduction in cytokine and chemokine expression and decreased immune cell marker expression. Decreased inflammatory response was associated with decreased tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Overall, MHY1025 alleviated renal fibrosis by directly modulating renal epithelial inflammation and fibroblast activation, suggesting that MHY1025 has the potential to be a therapeutic agent for CKD.",kidney disease
Inhibition of Indoxyl Sulfate-Induced Reactive Oxygen Species-Related Ferroptosis Alleviates Renal Cell Injury In Vitro and Chronic Kidney Disease Progression In Vivo.,"['Li-TingTsai', 'Te-IWeng', 'Ting-YuChang', 'Kuo-ChengLan', 'Chih-KangChiang', 'Shing-HwaLiu']","The accumulation of the uremic toxin indoxyl sulfate (IS) is a key pathological feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effect of IS on ferroptosis and the role of IS-related ferroptosis in CKD are not well understood. We used a renal tubular cell model and an adenine-induced CKD mouse model to explore whether IS induces ferroptosis and injury and affects iron metabolism in the renal cells and the kidneys. Our results showed that exposure to IS induced several characteristics for ferroptosis, including iron accumulation, an impaired antioxidant system, elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and lipid peroxidation. Exposure to IS triggered intracellular iron accumulation by upregulating transferrin and transferrin receptors, which are involved in cellular iron uptake. We also observed increased levels of the iron storage protein ferritin. The effects of IS-induced ROS generation, lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis, senescence, ER stress, and injury/fibrosis were effectively alleviated by treatments with an iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) in vitro and the adsorbent charcoal AST-120 (scavenging the IS precursor) in vivo. Our findings suggest that IS triggers intracellular iron accumulation and ROS generation, leading to the induction of ferroptosis, senescence, ER stress, and injury/fibrosis in CKD kidneys. AST-120 administration may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy.",kidney disease
Lipolysis supports bone formation by providing osteoblasts with endogenous fatty acid substrates to maintain bioenergetic status.,"['AnanyaNandy', 'Ron C MHelderman', 'SantoshThapa', 'ShobanaJayapalan', 'AlisonRichards', 'NikitaNarayani', 'Michael PCzech', 'Clifford JRosen', 'ElizabethRendina-Ruedy']","Bone formation is a highly energy-demanding process that can be impacted by metabolic disorders. Glucose has been considered the principal substrate for osteoblasts, although fatty acids are also important for osteoblast function. Here, we report that osteoblasts can derive energy from endogenous fatty acids stored in lipid droplets via lipolysis and that this process is critical for bone formation. As such, we demonstrate that osteoblasts accumulate lipid droplets that are highly dynamic and provide the molecular mechanism by which they serve as a fuel source for energy generation during osteoblast maturation. Inhibiting cytoplasmic lipolysis leads to both an increase in lipid droplet size in osteoblasts and an impairment in osteoblast function. The fatty acids released by lipolysis from these lipid droplets become critical for cellular energy production as cellular energetics shifts towards oxidative phosphorylation during nutrient-depleted conditions. In vivo, conditional deletion of the ATGL-encoding gene Pnpla2 in osteoblast progenitor cells reduces cortical and trabecular bone parameters and alters skeletal lipid metabolism. Collectively, our data demonstrate that osteoblasts store fatty acids in the form of lipid droplets, which are released via lipolysis to support cellular bioenergetic status when nutrients are limited. Perturbations in this process result in impairment of bone formation, specifically reducing ATP production and overall osteoblast function.",kidney disease
Elevated circulating follistatin associates with increased risk of mortality and cardiometabolic disorders.,"['JingxuePan', 'JanNilsson', 'GunnarEngström', 'YangDe Marinis']","Previous study showed that elevated circulating hepatokine follistatin (FST) associates with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes by inducing adipose tissue insulin resistance. Here we explore further the relationships between plasma FST levels with mortality and health outcomes.
The population-based Malmö Diet Cancer cardiovascular cohort (n = 4733, age 45-68 years) was used to study plasma FST in relation to incidence of health outcomes, by linkage with national patient registers. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the associations of plasma FST and outcomes, with adjustments for multiple potential confounding factors. During the mean follow-up time of 22.64 ± 5.84 years in 4,733 individuals, 526 had incident stroke, 432 had ischemic stroke, 530 had incident coronary events (CE), 339 had incident heart failure (HF), 320 had incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 1,843 individuals died. Hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation increase in FST levels adjusted for multiple risk factors was 1.05 (95%CI: 1.00-1.11, p = 0.036) for mortality; 1.10 (95%CI: 1.00-1.20, p = 0.042) for stroke; 1.13 (95%CI: 1.03-1.25, p = 0.014) for ischemic stroke; 1.16 (95%CI: 1.03-1.30, p = 0.015) for HF; and 1.38 (95%CI: 1.12-1.70, p = 0.003) for a diagnosis of CKD. In MDC-CC individuals without prevalent or incident diabetes, the association between FST and stroke, CE and CKD remained significant; but not with mortality or HF.
Elevated circulating FST associates with an increased risk of mortality and HF, which partly may be mediated by diabetes. FST also associated with stroke, ischemic stroke, CE and CKD, independently of established risk factors including diabetes.",kidney disease
Effect of regulated vitamin D increase on vascular markers in patients with chronic kidney disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"['ShujunPan', 'KaibiYang', 'YiweiShang', 'RizhenYu', 'LinLiu', 'JuanJin', 'QiangHe']","The effect of increased vitamin D levels on vascular function in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effect of regulated vitamin D increase on vascular markers in patients with CKD.
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception up until July 21, 2023. We included randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of using vitamin D and its analogues on vascular function in patients with CKD. Fixed-effects and random-effects model analyses were performed using weighted mean difference effects for each trial by heterogeneity (I2) assessment. Primary outcomes encompassed blood flow-mediated dilation (FMD)、pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AIx).
From 1964 records we selected 12 trials, 5 (n = 331) on FMD, 8 (n = 626) on PWV and 4 (n = 393) on AIx. Vitamin D and VDRA supplementation failed to significantly improve FMD (WMD 1.68%; 95% CI -0.18 to 3.53; P = 0.08; I

Chitosan-based oral nanoparticles as an efficient platform for kidney-targeted drug delivery in the treatment of renal fibrosis.,"['QianZhang', 'YingLi', 'ShuaiWang', 'DonghaoGu', 'CuihuaZhang', 'ShihaoXu', 'XiaoliFang', 'ChenyangLi', 'HaiqiangWu', 'WeiXiong']","There is increasingly keen interest in developing orally delivered targeted drugs, especially for diseases that require long-term medication. Hence, we manufactured nanoparticles derived from methoxypolyethylene glycol-chitosan (PCS) to enhance the oral delivery and kidney-targeted distribution of salvianolic acid B (SalB), a naturally occurring renoprotective and anti-fibrotic compound, as a model drug for the treatment of renal fibrosis. Orally administered SalB-loaded PCS nanoparticles (SalB-PCS-NPs) maintained good stability in the gastrointestinal environment, improved mucus-penetrating capacity, and enhanced transmembrane transport through a Caco-2 cell monolayer. The relative oral bioavailability of SalB-PCS-NPs to free SalB and SalB-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (SalB-CS-NPs) was 367.0 % and 206.2 %, respectively. The structural integrity of SalB-PCS-NPs after crossing the intestinal barrier was also validated by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in vitro and in vivo. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled SalB-PCS-NPs showed higher kidney accumulation than free FITC and FITC-labeled SalB-CS-NPs (4.6-fold and 2.1-fold, respectively). Significant improvements in kidney function, extracellular matrix accumulation, and pathological changes were observed in a unilateral ureter obstruction mouse model of renal fibrosis after once daily oral treatment with SalB-PCS-NPs for 14 days. Thus, oral administration of SalB-PCS-NPs represents a promising new strategy for kidney-targeted drug delivery.",kidney disease
Chronic kidney disease's impact on revascularization and subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with chronic coronary syndrome.,"['Shereen IbrahimFarag', 'Shaimaa AhmedMostafa', 'HamzaKabil', 'Mohamed RedaElfaramawy']","To determine the impact of CKD on the completeness of revascularization and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS).
The study enrolled 400 CCS patients who underwent revascularization by PCI. They were separated into two categories according to their eGFR levels: the control group: 200 patients with eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73m
CKD patients were significantly older (65.78 ± 6.41 vs. 56.70 ± 9.20 years, P=<0.001). They had higher syntax scores (P = 0.005), CIN (P = 0.001), all-cause mortality (P = 0.02), MACE (P = 0.037), and heart failure (P = 0.014). After reclassification according to revascularization. GFR was significantly reduced among patients with incomplete revascularization (51.08 ± 28.15 vs. 65.67 ± 26.62, respectively, P =<0.001). Repeated revascularization (P < 0.001), STEMI (P = 0.003), stent thrombosis (P = 0.015), MACE (P < 0.001), stroke (P < 0.001), and all-cause mortality (P < 0.001) were more prevalent among patients with incomplete revascularization. Multivariate regression analysis revealed eGFR (P = 0.001) and Syntax score (SS) (P=<0.001) as independent predictors of incomplete revascularization. The optimal eGFR cutoff value for predicting partial revascularization is 49.50mL/min/1.73m2, with 58.8% sensitivity and 69.3 % specificity.
Chronic kidney disease is associated with a higher syntax score and incomplete revascularization prevalence in CCS patients. Additionally, incomplete revascularization is associated with an increased incidence of major adverse cardiac events. In patients with CCS, CKD predicts partial revascularization and subsequent MACE.",kidney disease
Fatty Liver Index as a proxy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and the risk of stroke and coronary heart disease: The Suita Study.,"['AhmedArafa', 'RenaKashima', 'ChisaMatsumoto', 'YoshihiroKokubo']","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in developed countries, but its role in predicting cardiovascular disease (CVD) needs further investigation. Herein, we studied the association between NAFLD and the risk of CVD, stroke, and coronary heart disease (CHD) among Japanese people.
This prospective cohort study analyzed data from 2,517 men and 3,958 women, aged 30-84 years, who were registered in the Suita Study. NAFLD was defined as Fatty Liver Index (FLI) ≥ 60. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of incident CVD, stroke, and CHD events by baseline FLI. The results were adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, diabetes, lipid profile, chronic kidney disease, and cardiac murmur or valvular diseases.
Within 16.6 years of median follow-up, 590 participants developed CVD (346 stroke events and 244 CHD events). Women with NAFLD (FLI ≥ 60) showed a higher risk of CVD and stroke: HRs (95% CIs) = 1.69 (1.16, 2.46) and 2.06 (1.31, 3.24), respectively. Besides, women in the fourth and fifth (highest) FLI quintiles showed a higher risk of CVD and stroke than those in the third (middle) quintile: HRs (95% CIs) = 1.60 (1.08, 2.36) and 1.67 (1.13, 2.45) for CVD and 1.73 (1.07, 2.79) and 1.90 (1.18, 3.05) for stroke, respectively. No corresponding associations were detected in men. NAFLD was not associated with CHD risk in either sex.
NAFLD, diagnosed by FLI, was associated with a higher risk of CVD and stroke in Japanese women. From a preventive perspective, women with NAFLD should be targeted for CVD screenings and interventions.",kidney disease

The mechanisms of cardiac remodeling are largely unclear. To dissect molecular and cellular mechanisms of cardiac remodeling in CKD in an unbiased fashion, we performed left ventricular single-nuclear RNA sequencing in two mouse models of CKD. Our data showed a hypertrophic response trajectory of cardiomyocytes with stress signaling and metabolic changes driven by soluble uremia-related factors. We mapped fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation in this process and identified notable changes in the cardiac vasculature, suggesting inflammation and dysfunction. An integrated analysis of cardiac cellular responses to uremic toxins pointed toward endothelin-1 and methylglyoxal being involved in capillary dysfunction and TNFα driving cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in CKD, which was validated in vitro and in vivo. TNFα inhibition in vivo ameliorated the cardiac phenotype in CKD. Thus, interventional approaches directed against uremic toxins, such as TNFα, hold promise to ameliorate cardiac remodeling in CKD.",kidney disease

Currently, the incidence of AKI and progression to kidney replacement therapy (RRT) in critically ill patients with vv-ECMO for severe COVID-19 and implications on outcome are still unclear.
Retrospective analysis at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (Germany) between March 1st, 2020 and July 31st, 2021. Demographics, clinical parameters, AKI, type of organ support, length of ICU stay, mortality and severity scores were assessed.
Ninety-one critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 requiring ECMO were included. The median age of the study population was 57 (IQR 49-64) years and 67% (n = 61) were male. The median SAPS II and SOFA Score on admission were 40 (34-46) and 12 (10-14) points, respectively. We observed that 45% (n = 41) developed early-AKI, 38% (n = 35) late-AKI and 16% (n = 15) no AKI during the ICU stay. Overall, 70% (n = 64) of patients required RRT during the ICU stay, 93% with early-AKI and 74% with late-AKI. Risk factors for early-AKI were younger age (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.99, p = 0.02) and SAPS II (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.19, p < 0.001). Patients with and without RRT were comparable regarding baseline characteristics. SAPS II (41 vs. 37 points, p < 0.05) and SOFA score (13 vs. 12 points, p < 0.05) on admission were significantly higher in patients receiving RRT. The median duration of ICU (36 vs. 28 days, p = 0.27) stay was longer in patients with RRT. An ICU mortality rate in patients with RRT in 69% (n = 44) and in patients without RRT of 56% (n = 27) was observed (p = 0.23).
Critically ill patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS requiring vv-ECMO are at high risk of early acute kidney injury.

Neuraminidase-induced externalization of phosphatidylserine activates ADAM17 and impairs insulin signaling in endothelial cells.,"['LarissaFerreira-Santos', 'Francisco IRamirez-Perez', 'Christopher AFoote', 'Marc AAugenreich', 'Neil JMcMillan', 'Morgan BWilliams', 'Juan DGonzalez-Vallejo', 'GavinPower', 'Andrew AWheeler', 'CamilaManrique-Acevedo', 'Luis AMartinez-Lemus', 'JaumePadilla']","Endothelial insulin resistance represents a causal factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and vascular disease, thus the need to identify molecular mechanisms underlying defects in endothelial insulin signaling. We previously have shown that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17 (ADAM17) is increased while insulin receptor α-subunit (IRα) is decreased in the vasculature of patients with T2D, leading to impaired insulin-induced vasodilation. We have also demonstrated that ADAM17 sheddase activity targets IRα; however, the mechanisms driving endothelial ADAM17 activity in T2D are largely unknown. Herein, we report that externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane causes ADAM17-mediated shedding of IRα and blunting of insulin signaling in endothelial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endothelial PS externalization is mediated by the phospholipid scramblase anoctamin-6 (ANO6) and that this process can be stimulated by neuraminidase, a soluble enzyme that cleaves sialic acid residues. Of note, we demonstrate that men and women with T2D display increased levels of neuraminidase activity in plasma, relative to age-matched healthy individuals, and this occurs in conjunction with increased ADAM17 activity and impaired leg blood flow responses to endogenous insulin. Collectively, this work reveals the neuraminidase-ANO6-ADAM17 axis as a novel potential target for restoring endothelial insulin sensitivity in T2D.",kidney disease

C57BL6 mice were subjected to distinct protocols: (i) administration with PCS (20, 40, or 60 mg/L/day) for 15 days and (ii) AKI due to unilateral IR injury associated with PCS administration for 15 days. The 20 mg/L dose of PCS led to a decrease in renal mass, an increase in the gene expression of Cystatin C and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), and a decrease in the α-actin in the heart. During AKI, PCS increased the renal injury biomarkers compared to control; however, it did not exacerbate these markers. Furthermore, PCS did not enhance the cardiac hypertrophy observed after 15 days of IR. An increase, but not potentialized, in the cardiac levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 in the IR group treated with PCS, as well as in the injured kidney, was also noticed. In short, PCS administration did not intensify kidney injury, inflammation, and cardiac outcomes after AKI.",kidney disease

We used KR-STDZN-PT data of creatinine tests from 2015 to 2022. Acceptance of the participating institutions' test results was assessed by calculating the acceptance performance as absolute bias (absBias%), total coefficient of variance (tCV%), and total error (TE%) for each sample using six measurements from each institution and true values of each reference material. The test result was considered acceptable when absBias%, tCV%, and TE% were <5.10, <3.20, and <11.40 %, respectively. The proportion of acceptable institutions among all participating institutions in each round was defined as the acceptance rate. Improvements in absBias%, tCV%, and TE% were analyzed using creatinine concentration ranges in samples.
The number of participating institutions increased from 2015 to 2017 but remained consistent since 2018. The acceptance rates for absBias% and TE% increased from 52.2 and 77.6 %, in 2015 and to 90.7 and 96.3 %, in 2022, respectively. The acceptance rate for tCV% remained in the 90 % range for eight years. When creatinine <3 mg/dL, mean absBias%, and mean TE% improved significantly in 2021-2022 compared to 2015-2016 (p<0.05). When creatinine >3 mg/dL, acceptance performance did not improve. Mean tCV% remained consistent annually regardless of creatinine concentration. No significant variations in test methods were observed.

Overall, 154 patients met the inclusion criteria. Among all RAPNs, 90 (58.4%), 43 (28.0%), and 21 (13.6%) were performed with WI, SAC, and ZI, respectively. Thirty-three (21.4%) patients experienced postoperative AKI. We extrapolated ischemia time thresholds of 17 min for WI and 29 min for SAC associated with the occurrence of postoperative AKI. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that WIT ≤ 17 min (odds ratio [OR] 0.1, 
Our results confirm the commonly accepted 20 min threshold for WI time, suggest less than 30 min ischemia time when using SAC, and support a ZI approach if safely performable to reduce the risk of postoperative AKI. Selecting an appropriate ischemia type for patients undergoing RAPN can improve short- and long-term functional kidney outcomes.",kidney disease
Anti-B Cell Maturation Antigen Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy for the Treatment of AL Amyloidosis and Concurrent Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma: Preliminary Efficacy and Safety.,"['SauravDas', 'SikanderAilawadhi', 'TaimurSher', 'VivekRoy', 'AndreFernandez', 'Ricardo DParrondo']","While immunotherapies, such as CAR T therapy and bi-specific antibodies, have revolutionized the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), patients with AL amyloidosis have been excluded from trials with these agents due to concerns of underlying autonomic, cardiac, and renal dysfunction, leading to potentially fatal toxicities from these therapies. In this communication, we described the outcomes of two patients with AL amyloidosis and concurrent MM with underlying cardiac and/or renal dysfunction who underwent anti-BCMA CAR T cell therapy with ide-cel or cilta-cel, received cytokine release syndrome prophylaxis, and tolerated therapy well with manageable toxicities and achieved a MRD-negative state.

Immune dysregulation can promote the development of cardiovascular diseases as well as exacerbate their course. The disorders may occur due to the presence of primary immune defects (currently known as inborn errors of immunity) and the more common secondary immune deficiencies. Secondary immune deficiencies can be caused by certain chronic conditions (such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obesity, autoimmune diseases, or cancer), nutritional deficiencies (including both lack of nutrients and bioactive non-nutrient compounds), and medical treatments and addictive substances.

The Ketogenic Effect of SGLT-2 Inhibitors-Beneficial or Harmful?,"['MichailKoutentakis', 'JakubKuciński', 'DamianŚwieczkowski', 'StanisławSurma', 'Krzysztof JFilipiak', 'AleksandraGąsecka']","Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, also called gliflozins or flozins, are a class of drugs that have been increasingly used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) due to their glucose-lowering, cardiovascular (CV), and renal positive effects. However, recent studies suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors might also have a ketogenic effect, increasing ketone body production. While this can be beneficial for some patients, it may also result in several potential unfavorable effects, such as decreased bone mineral density, infections, and ketoacidosis, among others. Due to the intricate and multifaceted impact caused by SGLT-2 inhibitors, this initially anti-diabetic class of medications has been effectively used to treat both patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those with heart failure (HF). Additionally, their therapeutic potential appears to extend beyond the currently investigated conditions. The objective of this review article is to present a thorough summary of the latest research on the mechanism of action of SGLT-2 inhibitors, their ketogenesis, and their potential synergy with the ketogenic diet for managing diabetes. The article particularly discusses the benefits and risks of combining SGLT-2 inhibitors with the ketogenic diet and their clinical applications and compares them with other anti-diabetic agents in terms of ketogenic effects. It also explores future directions regarding the ketogenic effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors.",kidney disease
Association between Chronic Kidney Disease and Dynapenia in Elderly Koreans.,"['Do-YounLee', 'SunghoonShin']","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is caused by various factors such as chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and obesity. Loss of muscle strength and mass is a negative prognostic factor for CKD. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the association between CKD and dynapenia in the Korean elderly. To this end, we analyzed 7029 participants from the 2014-2019 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) aged ≥65 years. After adjusting for all of the covariates that could affect the results, such as physical examinations, lifestyle factors, and exercise, the association between CKD and dynapenia was found to be significant, at 1.207 (95% CI: 1.056-1.379) in CKD stage 2 and 1.790 (95% CI: 1.427-2.246) in CKD stage 3a-5. However, when sexes were analyzed separately, women were significant in both CKD stage 2 and stage 3-5 compared to normal, but only in stage 3-5 for men. Additionally, the prevalence of dynapenia increased significantly as the stage of CKD increased (normal, stage 2, and stage 3-5: 18.5%, 20.8%, and 32.3% in men and 27.5%, 34.4%, and 46.1% in women, respectively).

Access to specialist psychological or social support is limited, with inadequate provision of psychosocial support available across UK renal units. The COSMIC study (examining the acceptability and feasibility of the Compassionate Mindful Resilience programme for adult patients with chronic kidney disease) aimed to support a new service development project, in partnership with Kidney Care UK, by implementing the Compassionate Mindful Resilience (CMR) programme, developed by MindfulnessUK, and explore its feasibility for patients with stage 4 or 5 kidney disease and kidney transplant recipients. This paper reports on the qualitative exploratory work which examined the experiences of study participants, their adherence to practice, and the acceptability of the intervention.
Participants (n = 19) took part in semi-structured interviews, which were transcribed, coded, and thematically analysed.
Three themes (and nine subthemes) were reported: experiences of the CMR programme that facilitated subjective benefit, participants' lived and shared experiences, and the practicalities of CMR programme participation. All participants reported that they found taking part in the CMR programme to be a beneficial experience.
The CMR programme was found to be an acceptable intervention for people living with kidney disease and provided tools and techniques that support the mental health and wellbeing of this patient group.

A Review of Electroactive Nanomaterials in the Detection of Nitrogen-Containing Organic Compounds and Future Applications.,"['MohanrajJagannathan', 'DurgalakshmiDhinasekaran', 'Ajay RakkeshRajendran', 'SungboCho']","Electrochemical and impedimetric detection of nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs) in blood, urine, sweat, and saliva is widely used in clinical diagnosis. NOC detection is used to identify illnesses such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular complications, diabetes, cancer, and others. In recent years, nanomaterials have shown significant potential in the detection of NOCs using electrochemical and impedimetric sensors. This potential is due to the higher surface area, porous nature, and functional groups of nanomaterials, which can aid in improving the sensing performance with inexpensive, direct, and quick-time processing methods. In this review, we discuss nanomaterials, such as metal oxides, graphene nanostructures, and their nanocomposites, for the detection of NOCs. Notably, researchers have considered nanocomposite-based devices, such as a field effect transistor (FET) and printed electrodes, for the detection of NOCs. In this review, we emphasize the significant importance of electrochemical and impedimetric methods in the detection of NOCs, which typically show higher sensitivity and selectivity. So, these methods will open a new way to make embeddable electrodes for point-of-detection (POD) devices. These devices could be used in the next generation of non-invasive analysis for biomedical and clinical applications.

Bone Disorders in Pediatric Chronic Kidney Disease: A Literature Review.,"['LaviniaCapossela', 'SerenaFerretti', ""SilviaD'Alonzo"", 'LorenzoDi Sarno', 'ValeriaPansini', 'AntoniettaCuratola', 'AntonioChiaretti', 'AntonioGatto']","Intense changes in mineral and bone metabolism are frequent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and represent an important cause of morbidity and reduced quality of life. These disorders have conventionally been defined as renal osteodystrophy and classified based on bone biopsy, but due to a lack of bone biopsy data and validated radiological methods to evaluate bone morphology in children, it has been challenging to effectively assess renal osteodystrophy in pediatric CKD; the consequence has been the suboptimal management of bone disorders in children. CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a new expression used to describe a systemic disorder of mineral and bone metabolism as a result of CKD. CKD-MBD is a triad of biochemical imbalances in calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, and vitamin D; bone deformities and soft tissue calcification.

The present study investigated the effects of celastrol on tumor necrosis factor‑related apoptosis‑inducing ligand receptor 2 (TRAIL‑R2)‑mediated apoptosis and cytotoxicity in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells when administered in combination with lexatumumab, a human monoclonal agonistic antibody that specifically recognizes TRAIL‑R2. Cytotoxicity was determined by colorimetric assays of cell viability using cell counting kit‑8. The activation of caspases was assessed by quantitative colorimetric assays using caspase‑specific kits. Celastrol significantly enhanced lexatumumab‑induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity in RCC cells. An enhanced effect was also achieved when the duration of treatment with lexatumumab and celastrol was reduced from 24 to 6 h. The expression of TRAIL‑R2 was also remarkably increased by celastrol. Combined treatment with lexatumumab and celastrol significantly triggered activation of the caspase cascade, including caspase‑8, ‑9, ‑6, and ‑3, downstream molecules of death receptors. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity induced by that combination was significantly suppressed by the DR5:Fc chimeric protein, as well as specific inhibitors of caspase‑8, ‑9, ‑6 and ‑3. Taken together, these results indicated that celastrol enhances both TRAIL‑R2‑mediated apoptosis and cytotoxicity by upregulating TRAIL‑R2 and activating the caspase cascade, indicating the possibility of using it in combination with lexatumumab as an innovative therapeutic strategy for treating RCC.",kidney disease

However, it is unknown whether dietary fiber has a beneficial effect on preventing the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Using the UK Biobank prospective cohort, 110,412 participants who completed at least one dietary questionnaire and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio <30 mg/g, and no history of CKD were included. The primary exposure was total dietary fiber density, calculated by dividing the absolute amount of daily total fiber intake by total energy intake (g/1,000 kcal). We separately examined soluble and insoluble fiber densities as additional predictors. The primary outcome was incident CKD based on diagnosis codes.
A total of 3,507 (3.2%) participants developed incident CKD during a median follow-up of 9.9 years. In a multivariable cause-specific model, the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs; 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for incident CKD were 0.85 (0.77-0.94), 0.78 (0.70-0.86), and 0.76 (0.68-0.86), respectively, for the second, third, and highest quartiles of dietary fiber density (reference: lowest quartile). In a continuous model, the aHR for each +∆1.0g/1,000 kcal increase in dietary fiber density was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99). This pattern of associations was similar for both soluble and insoluble fiber densities and did not differ across subgroups of sex, age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and inflammation.
Increased fiber intake was associated with a lower risk of CKD in this large well-characterized cohort.",kidney disease
Frailty and Humoral Immune Responses Following COVID-19 Vaccination among Patients Undergoing Hemodialysis.,"['T-YLin', 'S-CHung']","Patients with end-stage kidney disease who are undergoing dialysis have reduced immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination. Frailty is extremely common among dialysis patients and may contribute to the impaired immunogenicity. This study aimed to determine the association between frailty and humoral immune responses following COVID-19 vaccination in hemodialysis patients.
Adult hemodialysis patients without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection who received a priming dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, an adenovirus-vectored vaccine, were assessed for eligibility. Participants were categorized as robust, pre-frail, or frail using the Fried frailty criteria. Humoral responses were assessed 28 days after vaccination by measuring titers of anti-spike IgG antibodies. The primary outcome was anti-spike antibody seroconversion, defined as antibody levels ≥50 AU/mL. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were used to assess the association between frailty status and the primary outcome.
A total of 206 participants (mean age 67 ± 13 years, 50% women) were included in the study, of whom 50 (24%) were characterized as frail, 86 (42%) were characterized as pre-frail, and 70 (34%) were characterized as robust. Anti-spike antibody levels were progressively lower with more advanced stages of frailty (P <0.001). Compared with robust patients, a significantly smaller proportion of pre-frail and frail patients developed anti-spike antibody seroconversion (87%, 66%, and 40%, respectively; P <0.001). Frailty was associated with the absence of humoral responses after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, coronary artery disease, serum albumin, and lymphocyte count (OR=0.25; 95% CI, 0.08-0.80).
Frailty is independently associated with impaired humoral responses following COVID-19 vaccination among hemodialysis patients. Strategies aimed at preventing or attenuating frailty in the dialysis population are warranted.",kidney disease
3D printed tubulointerstitium chip as an in vitro testing platform.,"['GabrieleAddario', 'DaphneEussen', 'SonjaDjudjaj', 'PeterBoor', 'LorenzoMoroni', 'CarlosMota']","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) ranks as the twelfth leading cause of death worldwide and represents a major global health problem with still rather limited treatment options. The development of new in vitro models replicating defined segments of the kidney functional units, i.e., the nephrons, in a physiologically relevant and reproducible manner could facilitate drug testing and development. We aimed at producing an in vitro organ-on-a-chip platform with extrusion-based 3D printing approach with sacrificial components. We optimized the manufacturing of the tubular platform produced by printing sacrificial fibers in varying diameters, which provide a suitable structure for cell adhesion and proliferation. The manufactured chip platform was seeded with primary murine tubular epithelial cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The effect of channel geometry, its reproducibility, coatings for optimal cell adhesion, and specific cell markers were investigated. The developed chip presents single and dual channels, mimicking segments of a renal tubule and the capillary network. Together with an extracellular matrix gel analogue placed in the middle of the two channels we aimed at mimicking the renal tubulointerstitium in vitro. The proposed 3D printed platform enables perfusable circular cross-section channels with fully automated, rapid and reproducible manufacturing processes at low costs. In conclusion, this kidney tubulointerstitium on-a-chip provides the first step toward the production of more complex in vitro models for drug testing and identification.

[Hepatorenal Syndrome].,"['Jun CheolChoi', 'Jeong-JuYoo']","Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a critical and potentially life-threatening complication of advanced liver disease, including cirrhosis. It is characterized by the development of renal dysfunction in the absence of underlying structural kidney pathology. The pathophysiology of HRS involves complex interactions between systemic and renal hemodynamics, neurohormonal imbalances, and the intricate role of vasoconstrictor substances. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for the timely identification and management of HRS. The diagnosis of HRS is primarily clinical and relies on specific criteria that consider the exclusion of other causes of renal dysfunction. The management of HRS comprises two main approaches: vasoconstrictor therapy and albumin infusion, which aim to improve renal perfusion and mitigate the hyperdynamic circulation often seen in advanced liver disease. Additionally, strategies such as liver transplantation and renal replacement therapy are essential considerations based on individual patient characteristics and disease severity. This review article provides a comprehensive overview of hepatorenal syndrome, focusing on its pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and current management strategies.",kidney disease

Preeclampsia impedes foetal kidney development by delivering placenta-derived exosomes to glomerular endothelial cells.,"['MengqiGu', 'PengzhengChen', 'DongmeiZeng', 'XiaotongJiang', 'QingfengLv', 'YuchenLi', 'FengyuanZhang', 'ShutingWan', 'QianZhou', 'YuanLu', 'XietongWang', 'LeiLi']","Foetal renal dysplasia is still the main cause of adult renal disease. Placenta-derived exosomes are an important communication tool, and they may play an important role in placental (both foetal and maternal) function. We hypothesize that in women with preeclampsia, foetal renal dysplasia is impeded by delivering placenta-derived exosomes to glomerular endothelial cells.
In the present study, we established a PE trophoblast oxidative stress model to isolate exosomes from supernatants by ultracentrifugation (NO-exo and H/R-exo) and collected normal and PE umbilical cord blood plasma to isolate exosomes by ultracentrifugation combined with sucrose density gradient centrifugation (N-exo and PE-exo), then we investigated their effects on foetal kidney development by in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models.
The PE trophoblast oxidative stress model was established successfully. After that, in in vitro studies, we found that H/R-exo and PE-exo could adversely affect glomerular endothelial cell proliferation, tubular formation, migration, and barrier functions. In ex vivo studies, H/R-exo and PE-exo both inhibited the growth and branch formation of kidney explants, along with the decrease of VE-cadherin and Occludin. In in vivo studies, we also found that H/R-exo and PE-exo could result in renal dysplasia, reduced glomerular number, and reduced barrier function in foetal mice.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that PE placenta-derived exosomes could lead to foetal renal dysplasia by delivering placenta-derived exosomes to foetal glomerular endothelial cells, which provides a novel understanding of the pathogenesis of foetal renal dysplasia. Video Abstract.",kidney disease
Evaluation of ARK5 and SIRT3 expression in renal cell carcinoma and their clinical significance.,"['NohaElkady', 'Amira IAldesoky', 'Marwa MohammedDawoud']","Globally Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) represents 3% of malignant tumours in adults and 1.78% in Egypt. AMPK-related protein kinase 5 (ARK5) is mainly associated with a hypoxic microenvironment which is a feature of the major RCC subtypes. Additionally, it displays decreased mitochondrial respiration. SIRT3 is a mitochondrial deacetylase that modifies multiple mitochondrial proteins.
Fifty eight cases of RCC, and 30 non-neoplastic cases (of End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) were subjected to immunohistochemistry by ARK5 and SIRT3. The results of IHC were correlated together and correlated with the available clinicopathologic and survival data.
Although no significant difference was detected between RCC and ESKD groups regarding ARK5 expression, there was a significant association with RCC regarding H-score and nucleocytoplasmic expression (both P = 0.001). Also, SIRT3 was highly expressed in RCC in comparison to the ESKD group (H-score: P = 0.001). There were significant associations between nucleocytoplasmic ARK5 expression and higher tumour grade, low apoptotic and high mitotic indices, tumour extent, advanced tumour stage, and impaired response of tumours to chemotherapeutic drugs (P = 0.039, P = 0.001, P = 0.027, P = 0.011, P = 0.009, and P = 0.014 respectively). Moreover, the H score of ARK5 expression showed significant associations with tumour grade, apoptotic and mitotic indices, tumour extension, tumour stage, and response to therapy (P = 0.01, 0.035, 0.001, 0.004. 0.003 and 0.013). Regarding SIRT3 expression, it showed significant associations with apoptotic and mitotic indices, tumour extent, tumour stage and response to therapy (P = 0.022, 0.02, 0.042, 0.039 and 0.027). Interestingly, there was a highly significant correlation between the expression of ARK5 and SIRT3 (P = 0.009). Univariate survival analysis revealed a significant association between short survival duration and both nucleocytoplasmic expression of ARK5 and positive SIRT3 expression (P = 0.014 and 0.035).
ARK5 and SIRT3 are overexpressed in RCC and associated with parameters of poor prognosis as well as short survival. Both seem to influence response to therapy in RCC. So, they could be new targets for therapy that may improve tumour response and patients' survival. There is a postulated relationship that needs more extensive investigation.",kidney disease
Bilateral central serous retinal detachment in a patient with nephrotic syndrome: a case report.,"['RezaSadeghi', 'AmirrezaPashapouryeganeh', 'MortezaKarimi', 'EliasKhalili Pour', 'MasoudMirghorbani', 'HamidRiazi-Esfahani']","The aim of this report is to highlight the importance of considering nephrotic syndrome as a potential underlying cause of bilateral central serous retinal detachment in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and to underscore the significance of a comprehensive systemic workup in these patients.
A 19-year-old Iranian female patient with history of systemic lupus erythematosus presented with progressive vision loss and bilateral macular elevation. Ophthalmic examination revealed periorbital edema, chemosis, and subretinal fluid at the macula of both eyes. Optical coherence tomography confirmed the existence of subretinal fluid and serous detachment located at the macula of both eyes. On fluorescein angiography, there were no signs of subretinal leakage such as smoke stack sign or expansile dot in late phases. Laboratory tests detected hypoalbuminemia and significant proteinuria, leading to the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Treatment with prednisolone and albumin infusion resulted in improved visual acuity and resolution of subretinal fluid.
Nephrotic syndrome can be a rare underlying cause of bilateral central serous retinal detachment, and its association with systemic lupus erythematosus should be considered. Hypoalbuminemia in nephrotic syndrome alters fluid dynamics in the retina, contributing to bilateral central serous retinal detachment. Early recognition and management of nephrotic syndrome are essential for vision recovery and preventing long-term complications.",kidney disease

A total of 2,780 patients from two medical centers in East China who underwent primary isolated CABG were enrolled. The dataset was randomly divided for model training (80%) and model testing (20%). Four ML models based on LightGBM, Support vector machine (SVM), Softmax and random forest (RF) algorithms respectively were established in Python. A total of 2,051 patients from two other medical centers were assigned to an external validation group to verify the performances of the ML prediction models. The models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic, Bland-Altman plots, and decision curve analysis. The outcome of the LightGBM model was interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
The incidence of postoperative AKI in the modeling group was 13.4%. Similarly, the incidence of postoperative AKI of the two medical centers in the external validation group was 8.2% and 13.6% respectively. LightGBM performed the best in predicting, with an AUC of 0.8027 in internal validation group and 0.8798 and 0.7801 in the external validation group. The SHAP revealed the top 20 predictors of postoperative AKI ranked according to the importance, and the top three features on prediction were the serum creatinine in the first 24 h after operation, the last preoperative Scr level, and body surface area.
This study provides a LightGBM predictive model that can make accurate predictions for AKI after CABG surgery. The LightGBM model shows good predictive ability in both internal and external validation. It can help cardiac surgeons identify high-risk patients who may experience AKI after CABG surgery.",kidney disease
Pubertal luteinizing hormone levels in children with chronic kidney disease and association with change in glomerular filtration rate.,"['Hannah SKim', 'Derek KNg', 'Matthew BMatheson', 'Meredith AAtkinson', 'YasminAkhtar', 'Bradley AWarady', 'Susan LFurth', 'Rebecca LRuebner']","Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at risk for abnormalities in pubertal development. We aimed to describe the timing of pubertal onset by luteinizing hormone (LH) levels and the association between hormonal onset of puberty with changes in GFR.
Data from the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children (CKiD) study were collected prospectively. GFR was estimated at annual visits and measured by iohexol clearance every other year. LH was measured from stored repository serum samples in a nested sample of 124 participants. Hormonal onset of puberty was defined as LH level greater than or equal to 0.3 IU/L. A mixed effects model with random intercepts and slopes was used to compare the slope of decline of GFR before and after hormonal onset of puberty. The model was adjusted for age, glomerular disease diagnosis, baseline proteinuria on the log scale, and BMI.
Median age at hormonal onset of puberty was 9.9 years (IQR 8.1, 11.9) in girls and 10.2 years (IQR 9.2, 11.0) in boys. The mixed effects model showed faster decline in both estimated GFR and measured GFR in boys after hormonal onset of puberty (p < 0.001), and a similar but attenuated accelerated estimated GFR decline was observed for girls with no difference for measured GFR.
LH levels in the post-pubertal range were observed prior to clinical manifestations of puberty in children with CKD. Hormonal onset of puberty was associated with faster decline in GFR, particularly among boys with CKD.

Adipose cDC1s contribute to obesity-associated inflammation through STING-dependent IL-12 production.,"['Andrew DHildreth', 'Eddie TPadilla', 'MehaGupta', 'Yung YuWong', 'RyanSun', 'Akshara RLegala', ""Timothy EO'Sullivan""]","Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation that can contribute to the development of insulin resistance in mammals. Previous studies have identified interleukin (IL)-12 as a critical upstream regulator of WAT inflammation and metabolic dysfunction during obesity. However, the cell types and mechanisms that initiate WAT IL-12 production remain unclear. Here we show that conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) are the cellular source of WAT IL-12 during obesity through analysis of mouse and human WAT single-cell transcriptomic datasets, IL-12 reporter mice and IL-12p70 protein levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We demonstrate that cDC1s contribute to obesity-associated inflammation by increasing group 1 innate lymphocyte interferon-γ production and inflammatory macrophage accumulation. Inducible depletion of cDC1s increased WAT insulin sensitivity and systemic glucose tolerance during diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, endocytosis of apoptotic bodies containing self-DNA by WAT cDC1s drives stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-dependent IL-12 production. Together, these results suggest that WAT cDC1s act as critical regulators of adipose tissue inflammation and metabolic dysfunction during obesity.",kidney disease

However, evidence supporting the use of cabozantinib after IO combination therapy is lacking. We retrospectively analyzed patients who received second-line cabozantinib after IO combination therapy using the Japanese Urological Oncology Group (JUOG) database. In total, 254 patients were enrolled in the JUOG global study, and 118 patients who received second-line cabozantinib comprised the study cohort. The objective response rate, disease control rate, second-line cabozantinib progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival from second-line for overall were 32%, 75%, 10.5 months, and not reached, respectively, for first-line IO-IO therapy were 37%, 77%, 11.1 months, and not reached, respectively, versus 24%, 71%, 8.3 months, and not reached, respectively, for first-line IO-tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. In univariate and multivariate analyses, discontinuation of first-line treatment because of progressive disease and liver metastasis were independent risk factors for PFS. All-grade adverse events occurred in 72% of patients, and grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 28% of patients.

Nucleotide excision repair deficiency is a targetable therapeutic vulnerability in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"['AurelProsz', 'HaohuiDuan', 'ViktoriaTisza', 'PranshuSahgal', 'SabineTopka', 'Gregory TKlus', 'JuditBörcsök', 'ZsofiaSztupinszki', 'TimothyHanlon', 'MiklosDiossy', 'LauraVizkeleti', 'Dag RuneStormoen', 'IstvanCsabai', 'HellePappot', 'JosephVijai', 'KennethOffit', 'ThomasRied', 'NilaySethi', 'Kent WMouw', 'SandorSpisak', 'ShailjaPathania', 'ZoltanSzallasi']","Due to a demonstrated lack of DNA repair deficiencies, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has not benefitted from targeted synthetic lethality-based therapies. We investigated whether nucleotide excision repair (NER) deficiency is present in an identifiable subset of ccRCC cases that would render those tumors sensitive to therapy targeting this specific DNA repair pathway aberration. We used functional assays that detect UV-induced 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts to quantify NER deficiency in ccRCC cell lines. We also measured sensitivity to irofulven, an experimental cancer therapeutic agent that specifically targets cells with inactivated transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). In order to detect NER deficiency in clinical biopsies, we assessed whole exome sequencing data for the presence of an NER deficiency associated mutational signature previously identified in ERCC2 mutant bladder cancer. Functional assays showed NER deficiency in ccRCC cells. Some cell lines showed irofulven sensitivity at a concentration that is well tolerated by patients. Prostaglandin reductase 1 (PTGR1), which activates irofulven, was also associated with this sensitivity. Next generation sequencing data of the cell lines showed NER deficiency-associated mutational signatures. A significant subset of ccRCC patients had the same signature and high PTGR1 expression. ccRCC cell line-based analysis showed that NER deficiency is likely present in this cancer type. Approximately 10% of ccRCC patients in the TCGA cohort showed mutational signatures consistent with ERCC2 inactivation associated NER deficiency and also substantial levels of PTGR1 expression. These patients may be responsive to irofulven, a previously abandoned anticancer agent that has minimal activity in NER-proficient cells.",kidney disease

Cystic Kidney Diseases in Children and Adults: Differences and Gaps in Clinical Management.,"['ChristianHanna', 'Ioan-AndreiIliuta', 'WhitneyBesse', 'DjalilaMekahli', 'Fouad TChebib']","Cystic kidney diseases, when broadly defined, have a wide differential diagnosis extending from recessive diseases with a prenatal or pediatric diagnosis, to the most common autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease primarily affecting adults, and several other genetic or acquired etiologies that can manifest with kidney cysts. The most likely diagnoses to consider when assessing a patient with cystic kidney disease differ depending on family history, age stratum, radiologic characteristics, and extrarenal features. Accurate identification of the underlying condition is crucial to estimate the prognosis and initiate the appropriate management, identification of extrarenal manifestations, and counseling on recurrence risk in future pregnancies. There are significant differences in the clinical approach to investigating and managing kidney cysts in children compared with adults. Next-generation sequencing has revolutionized the diagnosis of inherited disorders of the kidney, despite limitations in access and challenges in interpreting the data. Disease-modifying treatments are lacking in the majority of kidney cystic diseases. For adults with rapid progressive autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease, tolvaptan (V2-receptor antagonist) has been approved to slow the rate of decline in kidney function. In this article, we examine the differences in the differential diagnosis and clinical management of cystic kidney disease in children versus adults, and we highlight the progress in molecular diagnostics and therapeutics, as well as some of the gaps meriting further attention.",kidney disease
Association of the rs5186 polymorphism of the AGTR1 gene with decreased eGFR in patients with type 2 diabetes from Mexico City.,"['Manuel Alejandro ContrerasFigueroa', 'Irene MendozaLujambio', 'Teresa AlvaradoGutiérrez', 'María Fernanda PérezHernández', 'Evelyn Yazmín EstradaRamírez', 'Dominga JiménezGuzmán', 'María Fernanda LucasSánchez', 'Hannia Fernanda GonzálezMorales', 'Héctor Jaime GómezSamudio', 'Fernando SuarezSánchez', 'Margarita DíazFlores', 'Carlos Alberto JiménezZamarripa', 'Claudia Camelia CalzadaMendoza', 'María Esther OcharánHernández', 'Cora Mariana OrozcoVelázquez', 'Mariana SotoFlores', 'Daniela Vicenta HernándezOrozco', 'Gabriela Yanet CortésMoreno', 'MiguelCruz', 'Joséde Jesús Peralta Romero']","Early biomarkers search for Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), as genetic markers to identify vulnerable carriers of the disease even before Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) decline or microalbuminuria development, has been relevant during the last few years. The rs5186 (A116C) polymorphism of the Angiotensin II Receptor Type I gene (AGTR1), has been associated to multiple effects of renal injury risk, commonly detected in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM). It has been described that rs5186 could have an effect in stability proteins that assemble Angiotensin II Receptor Type I (AT1), modifying its action, which is why it should be considered as a risk factor for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), characterized by a GFR progressive reduction. Even though, the association between rs5186 AGTR1 gene polymorphism and DKD in patients with T2DM has been controversial, inconclusive, and even absent. This disputable issue might be as a result of association studies in which many and varied clinical phenotypes included are contemplated as CKD inductors and enhancers. Although, the sample sizes studied in patients with T2DM are undersized and did not have a strict inclusion criteria, lacking of biochemical markers or KDOQI classification, which have hindered its examination.
The aim of our study was to establish an association between rs5186 AGTR1 gene polymorphism and GFR depletion, assessed as a risk factor to DKD development in patients with T2DM.
We analyzed 297 not related patients with T2DM, divided into 221 controls (KDOQI 1) and 76 cases (KDOQI 2). Arterial pressure, anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured. rs5186 of AGTR1 genotyping was performed by TaqMan assay real-time PCR method. Allele and genotype frequencies, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were measured. Normality test for data distribution was analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk test, variable comparison by Student's t-test for continuous variables, and Chi-squared test for categorical variables; ANOVA test was used for mean comparison of more than two groups. Effect of rs5186 to DKD was estimated by multiple heritability adjustment models for risk variables of DKD. Statistical significance was indicated by p<0.05. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package STATA v11 software.
Dominant and Over-dominant models showed a likelihood ratio to GFR depletion of 1.89 (1.05-3.39, p=0.031) and 2.01 (1.08-3.73, p=0.023) in patients with T2DM. Risk factor increased to 2.54 (1.10-5.89) in women in Over-dominant model.
In clinical practice, most of nephropathies progress at a slow pace into a total breakdown of renal function, even asymptomatic. This is the first study, reporting that rs5186 polymorphism of AGTR1 gene contribution to GFR depletion, and this could be evaluated as a predisposing factor for DKD in patients with T2DM.",kidney disease
"Sheehan's syndrome presenting as massive pericardial effusion, ventricular tachycardia and diabetes insipidus.","['AhmadAlam', 'HamidAshraf', 'Azharuddin MohammadMalik', 'RazeenFatima']","Sheehan's syndrome (SS) is characterised by pituitary necrosis resulting from postpartum haemorrhage. While SS is uncommon in developed nations, it remains a prevalent cause of hypopituitarism in women, particularly in low/middle-income countries. Clinically, SS is characterised by a deficiency in anterior pituitary hormones; involvement of the posterior pituitary is less common. SS presenting as cardiac tamponade is rare, with only a few reported cases in the literature. In this report, we present the case of a patient with SS who arrived at the emergency department with symptoms of light-headedness, palpitations and dyspnoea. Echocardiography revealed a massive pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, and during treatment, the patient experienced ventricular tachycardia and circulatory collapse. The collaboration between various medical specialties, including emergency medicine, cardiology, critical care, endocrinology and radiology, played a crucial role in successful patient management. The multidisciplinary approach allowed for comprehensive care addressing acute cardiac complications and underlying hormonal deficiencies.",kidney disease
Metadherin orchestrates PKA and PKM2 to activate β-catenin signaling in podocytes during proteinuric chronic kidney disease.,"['XiaowenChen', 'JingXiao', 'DanpingTao', 'YunyiLiang', 'SijiaChen', 'LingyuShen', 'ShutingLi', 'ZerongZheng', 'YaoZeng', 'CongweiLuo', 'FenfenPeng', 'HaiboLong']","Podocyte damage is the major cause of glomerular injury and proteinuria in multiple chronic kidney diseases. Metadherin (MTDH) is involved in podocyte apoptosis and promotes renal tubular injury in mouse models of diabetic nephropathy and renal fibrosis; however, its role in podocyte injury and proteinuria needs further exploration. Here, we show that MTDH was induced in the glomerular podocytes of patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease and correlated with proteinuria. Podocyte-specific knockout of MTDH in mice reversed proteinuria, attenuated podocyte injury, and prevented glomerulosclerosis after advanced oxidation protein products challenge or adriamycin injury. Furthermore, specific knockout of MTDH in podocytes repressed β-catenin phosphorylation at the Ser675 site and inhibited its downstream target gene transcription. Mechanistically, on the one hand, MTDH increased cAMP and then activated protein kinase A (PKA) to induce β-catenin phosphorylation at the Ser675 site, facilitating the nuclear translocation of MTDH and β-catenin; on the other hand, MTDH induced the deaggregation of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) tetramers and promoted PKM2 monomers to enter the nucleus. This cascade of events leads to the formation of the MTDH/PKM2/β-catenin/CBP/TCF4 transcription complex, thus triggering TCF4-dependent gene transcription. Inhibition of PKA activity by H-89 or blockade of PKM2 deaggregation by TEPP-46 abolished this cascade of events and disrupted transcription complex formation. These results suggest that MTDH induces podocyte injury and proteinuria by assembling the β-catenin-mediated transcription complex by regulating PKA and PKM2 function.",kidney disease

It has been implicated in genetic and developmental disorders along with ischemic and drug-induced injuries. Despite its role in kidney function and disease, the medulla's baseline gene expression and epigenomic signatures have not been well described in the adult human kidney. Here we generated and analyzed gene expression (RNA-seq), chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq), chromatin conformation (Hi-C) and spatial transcriptomic data from the adult human kidney cortex and medulla. Tissue samples were obtained from macroscopically dissected cortex and medulla of tumor-adjacent normal material in nephrectomy specimens from five male patients. We used these carefully annotated specimens to reassign incorrectly labeled samples in the larger public Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project, and to extract meaningful medullary gene expression signatures. Using integrated analysis of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and conformation profiles, we found insights into medulla development and function and then validated this by spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry. Thus, our datasets provide a valuable resource for functional annotation of variants from genome-wide association studies and are freely accessible through an epigenome browser portal.",kidney disease
A small molecule chaperone rescues keratin-8 mediated trafficking of misfolded podocin to correct genetic Nephrotic Syndrome.,"['ValeryiaKuzmuk', 'IwonaPranke', 'RuthRollason', 'MatthewButler', 'Wen YDing', 'MatthewBeesley', 'Aoife MWaters', 'Richard JCoward', 'RichardSessions', 'JackTuffin', 'Rebecca RFoster', 'GéraldineMollet', 'CorinneAntignac', 'AleksanderEdelman', 'Gavin IWelsh', 'Moin ASaleem']","Podocin is a key membrane scaffolding protein of the kidney podocyte essential for intact glomerular filtration. Mutations in NPHS2, the podocin-encoding gene, represent the commonest form of inherited nephrotic syndrome (NS), with early, intractable kidney failure. The most frequent podocin gene mutation in European children is R138Q, causing retention of the misfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we provide evidence that podocin R138Q (but not wild-type podocin) complexes with the intermediate filament protein keratin 8 (K8) thereby preventing its correct trafficking to the plasma membrane. We have also identified a small molecule (c407), a compound that corrects the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator protein defect, that interrupts this complex and rescues mutant protein mistrafficking. This results in both the correct localization of podocin at the plasma membrane and functional rescue in both human patient R138Q mutant podocyte cell lines, and in a mouse inducible knock-in model of the R138Q mutation. Importantly, complete rescue of proteinuria and histological changes was seen when c407 was administered both via osmotic minipumps or delivered orally prior to induction of disease or crucially via osmotic minipump two weeks after disease induction. Thus, our data constitute a therapeutic option for patients with NS bearing a podocin mutation, with implications for other misfolding protein disorders.

The present study was mainly designed to investigate the role of HDACs in renal injury induced by hHcys. Firstly, we identified the expression patterns of HDACs and found that, among zinc-dependent HDACs, HDAC9 was preferentially upregulated in the kidney from mice with hHcys. Deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of HDAC9 ameliorated renal injury in mice with hHcys. Moreover, podocyte-specific deletion of HDAC9 significantly attenuated podocyte injury and proteinuria. In vitro, gene silencing of HDAC9 attenuated podocyte injury by inhibiting apoptosis, reducing oxidative stress and maintaining the expressions of podocyte slit diaphragm proteins. Mechanically, we proved for the first time that HDAC9 reduced the acetylation level of H3K9 in the promoter of Klotho, then inhibited gene transcription of Klotho, finally aggravating podocyte injury in hHcys. In conclusion, our results indicated that targeting of HDAC9 might be an attractive therapeutic strategy for the treatment of renal injury induced by hHcys.",kidney disease

We employed PCR for the detection of parasitic DNA in peripheral blood, Western Blot (WB) to identify serum IgG and Whole Blood Assay (WBA) to detect cytokines/chemokines after stimulation of whole blood with parasitic antigen.
One-hundred twenty patients residing in Italy were included in the study at the time of KT. Each patient that tested positive to at least one test was considered as Leishmania positive. Fifty out of 120 patients (42%) tested positive for one or more tests. The detection of specific cell-mediated response (32/111, 29%) was the most common marker of Leishmania infection, followed by a positive serology (24/120, 20%). Four patients (3%) harbored parasitic DNA in the blood.
Our findings underline the high prevalence of asymptomatic Leishmania infection in patients undergoing KT in Italy, who are potentially at-risk for parasite reactivation and can benefit from an increased vigilance.

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) has significantly accelerated the automatization of volumetric calculations, enhancing accuracy and reducing variability and labor. In this review, we show that a high correlation has been observed between Machine Learning (ML) methods and expert assessments in tumor volumetry; Yet, it is recognized as more challenging than organ volumetry. Liver volumetry has shown progression in accuracy with a decrease in error. If a relative error below 10 % is acceptable, ML-based liver volumetry can be considered reliable for standardized imaging protocols if used in patients without major anomalies. Similarly, ML-supported automatic kidney volumetry has also shown consistency and reliability in volumetric calculations. In contrast, AI-supported thyroid volumetry has not been extensively developed, despite initial works in 3D ultrasound showing promising results in terms of accuracy and reproducibility. Despite the advancements presented in the reviewed literature, the lack of standardization limits the generalizability of ML methods across diverse scenarios. The domain gap, i. e., the difference in probability distribution of training and inference data, is of paramount importance before clinical deployment of AI, to maintain accuracy and reliability in patient care. The increasing availability of improved segmentation tools is expected to further incorporate AI methods into routine workflows where volumetry will play a more prominent role in radionuclide therapy planning and quantitative follow-up of disease evolution.",kidney disease

The accumulation of BPS in tissue was colon > kidney > liver > plasma > testicle > heart > brain in SD rats orally administered BPS (10 and 50 mg/kg bw/day) for 32 days, which was similar in both 10 mg/kg bw/day and 50 mg/kg bw/day group. Rats given BPS orally developed hyperlipidemia and increased RBC membrane cholesterol, as well as changes in RBC morphology and function. Moreover, BPS at the concentrations measured in rats plasma caused oxidative stress and phosphatidylserine exposure in vitro RBCs. These combined factors led to RBC aggregation in blood and an increasing in the number of RBCs in the blood vessels of the liver in rats. The dynamic visual observation of RBCs in vein vessels of zebrafish embryos exposed to BPS at 0, 1, 10 and 100 μg/L further found that the flow of RBCs in the tail vein is slow or even immobile, posing the risk of venous thrombosis.

Cardiac evaluation of the liver transplant candidate.,"['StephenPossick', 'VandanaKhungar', 'RanjitDeshpande']","This review aims to summarize recent changes in the cardiac evaluation of adult liver transplant candidates. Over the last several years, there have been significant advances in the use of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) with and without fractional flow reserve (FFR) and increasingly widespread availability of coronary calcium scoring for risk stratification for obstructive coronary artery disease. This has led to novel strategies for risk stratification in cirrhotic patients being considered for liver transplant and an updated American Heart Association (AHA) position paper on the evaluation of liver and kidney transplant candidates. The diagnosis of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy has been refined. These new diagnostic criteria require that specific echocardiographic parameters are evaluated in all patients. The definition of pulmonary hypertension on echocardiography has been altered and no longer utilizes right atrium (RA) pressure estimates based on inferior vena cava (IVC) size and collapse. This provides more volume neutral estimates of pulmonary pressure.
Although CCTA has outstanding negative predictive value, false positive results are not uncommon and often lead to further testing. Revised diagnostic criteria for cirrhotic cardiomyopathy improve risk stratification for peri-operative volume overload and outcomes. Refined pulmonary hypertension criteria provide improved guidance for right heart catheterization (RHC) and referral to subspecialists. There are emerging data regarding the safety and efficacy of TAVR for severe aortic stenosis in cirrhotic patients.
Increased utilization of noninvasive testing, including CCTA and/or coronary calcium scoring, can improve the negative predictive value of testing for obstructive coronary artery disease and potentially reduce reliance on coronary angiography. Application of the 2020 criteria for cirrhotic cardiomyopathy will improve systolic and diastolic function assessment and subsequent perioperative risk stratification. The use of global strain scores is emphasized, as it provides important information beyond ejection fraction and diastolic parameters. A standardized one-parameter echo cut-off for elevated pulmonary pressures simplifies both evaluation and follow-up. Innovative transcutaneous techniques for valvular stenosis and regurgitation offer new options for patients at prohibitive surgical risk.",kidney disease

A total of 61 patients with CKD were randomized 1:1 into 2 groups and provided with either a new, tailored digital and telephone support program (CareKnowDo: 31/61, 51%) integrated with PV or standard care (PV alone: 30/61, 49%). Quantitative measures included clinical and psychosocial measures. The primary outcomes were feasibility based: recruitment rate, dropout, and the exploration of associations.
Of the 1392 patients screened in local kidney clinics, 269 (19.32%) met the basic inclusion criteria; the first 22.7% (61/269) who met the eligibility criteria were recruited to participate in the study. Of the 69 patients, 23 (38%) patients completed the final 6-month follow-up web-based survey. Reasons for the attrition were explored. A higher belief in the ability of the treatment to control CKD was associated with lower blood pressure at baseline (r=0.52; P=.005), and a higher perceived understanding of CKD at baseline was associated with lower blood pressure at follow-up (r=0.66; P<.001). Beliefs about medicines at baseline were associated with blood pressure at baseline but not at follow-up. This was true for both concerns about medicines (r=0.58; P=.001) and perceived necessity of medicines (r=0.42; P=.03).
A tailored digital and nurse call-based program to enhance support for patients with CKD was piloted in 2 NHS sites and found to be feasible and acceptable. However, to maximize the effectiveness of the intervention (and of future trials), consideration should be given to the target audience most likely to benefit, as well as how to help them access the program as quickly and easily as possible.

Therapeutic potential of melatonin in targeting molecular pathways of organ fibrosis.,"['AzamHosseinzadeh', 'Mohammad HosseinPourhanifeh', 'ShivaAmiri', 'MohammadSheibani', 'RanaIrilouzadian', 'Russel JReiter', 'SaeedMehrzadi']","Fibrosis, the excessive deposition of fibrous connective tissue in an organ in response to injury, is a pathological condition affecting many individuals worldwide. Fibrosis causes the failure of tissue function and is largely irreversible as the disease progresses. Pharmacologic treatment options for organ fibrosis are limited, but studies suggest that antioxidants, particularly melatonin, can aid in preventing and controlling fibrotic damage to the organs. Melatonin, an indole nocturnally released from the pineal gland, is commonly used to regulate circadian and seasonal biological rhythms and is indicated for treating sleep disorders. While it is often effective in treating sleep disorders, melatonin's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties also make it a promising molecule for treating other disorders such as organ fibrosis. Melatonin ameliorates the necrotic and apoptotic changes that lead to fibrosis in various organs including the heart, liver, lung, and kidney. Moreover, melatonin reduces the infiltration of inflammatory cells during fibrosis development. This article outlines the protective effects of melatonin against fibrosis, including its safety and potential therapeutic effects. The goal of this article is to provide a summary of data accumulated to date and to encourage further experimentation with melatonin and increase its use as an anti-fibrotic agent in clinical settings.",kidney disease
Single and combination immunotherapy with chemotherapy and the risk of AKI in patients with solid cancer.,"['Germana Alvesde Brito', 'Antonio Paulo NassarJunior', 'Milton Barros ESilva', 'Barbara BeltrameBettim', 'Benedito JorgePereira']","Acute kidney injury (AKI) has emerged as an important toxicity among patients with advanced cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence, risk factors and mortality of AKI in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with another form of immunotherapy or chemotherapy.
We included all patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with another form of immunotherapy or chemotherapy at AC Camargo Cancer Center from January 2015 to December 2019. AKI was defined as a ≥ 1.5 fold increase in creatinine from baseline within 12 months of immune checkpoint inhibitor initiation. We assessed the association between baseline demographics, comorbidities, medications and risk of AKI using a competing risk model, considering death as a competing event.
We included 614 patients in the analysis. The mean age was 58.4 ± 13.5 years, and the mean baseline creatinine was 0.8 ± 0.18 mg/dL. AKI occurred in 144 (23.5%) of the patients. The most frequent AKI etiologies were multifactorial (10.1%), hemodynamic (8.8%) and possibly immunotherapy-related (3.6%). The likelihood of AKI was greater in patients with genitourinary cancer (sHR 2.47 95% CI 1.34-4.55 p < 0.01), with a prior AKI history (sHR 2.1 95% CI 1.30-3.39 p < 0.01) and taking antibiotics (sHR 2.85 95% CI 1.54-5.27 p < 0.01).

Psychosocial Burden of Psoriasis: A Systematic Literature Review of Depression Among Patients with Psoriasis.,"['Paula CLuna', 'Chia-YuChu', 'MohammadFatani', 'CeciliaBorlenghi', 'AnnaAdora', 'Lyndon QLlamado', 'JamesWee']","Psoriasis is associated with various comorbidities with a notable psychosocial burden. This systematic literature review explores the burden of depression in patients with psoriasis, comparing it with that experienced by patients with other chronic medical conditions. Embase via Ovid, PubMed, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews via Ovid were searched for peer-reviewed studies published in English between January 1, 2016 and December 6, 2021 that reported real-world evidence or observational studies involving at least 100 adults (age ≥ 18 years) with general (unspecified) or plaque psoriasis experiencing symptoms of depression (but not restricted to patients with a clinical diagnosis). Any report of depression or suicidality was eligible for inclusion. Systematic literature reviews reporting depression/suicidality in other chronic medical conditions were also included. Statistical analysis was not performed; the study was descriptive only. A total of 1744 records were identified, and after several defined screenings by two independent reviewers for publication year, relevance, and sample size, 82 publications were included. Psoriasis was significantly associated with depression. The prevalence of depression in patients with psoriasis ranged from 0.2% to 74.6%, with incidence from 4.83 to 91.9 per 1000 person-years. The prevalence of depression was generally higher among patients with more severe psoriasis than those with less severe disease (as determined by Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI] scoring system) and was more prevalent among women than men with psoriasis. Depression in psoriasis significantly reduced quality of life, including factors such as sexual dysfunction, sleep difficulties, subjective well-being, and addictions. Comorbid hypertension, hyperlipidemia, psoriatic arthritis, obesity, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and statin use were all associated with increased depression risk in patients with psoriasis. This systematic literature review found that the burden of depression in psoriasis is no lower than in other chronic medical conditions. Greater awareness of the psychological impact of psoriasis would improve care and management, which should incorporate psychological interventions.",kidney disease
From ultra-processed foods towards healthy eating for CKD patients: a proposal of educational infographics.,"['MarinaPadial', 'AngelineTaylor', 'AliceSabatino', 'Giorgina BarbaraPiccoli', 'Carla MariaAvesani']","Ultraprocessed food (UPF) is defined as industrialized, packaged and ready-to-eat food produced on a large scale, using sophisticated industrial machinery. Examples of UPFs include salty and sweet snacks, industrialized biscuits and packaged meals, processed meats and sugary drinks. Ultraprocessed food has a long-shelf life, is highly palatable, microbiologically safe, affordable and most of all, easy to consume. For these reasons, its consumption has been increasing worldwide, and is replacing healthy homemade meals. The main concern of this dietary shift is that UPFs come with the addition of salt, sugar, unhealthy fats, and several additives and taste enhancers that contain, among other substances, relevant quantities of potassium, phosphate and sodium. A large proportion of UPF in the diet may carry risks for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) since it can worsen blood pressure and glycemic control, and lead to constipation, hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia. Acknowledging the importance of UPF in kidney health implies integrating nutritional counseling with information on UPFs, and specific educational material can be helpful for patients, caregivers, and also for health care providers. We developed a set of 3 infographics dedicated to CKD patients, with information on how to identify UPFs, reasons for decreasing consumption, how to compose a healthy CKD plate and tips for reading food labels in supermarkets and grocery shops. We hope that this material can be useful in CKD outpatient clinics and dialysis centers as well as in general practitioners' offices, caring for early stage CKD.",kidney disease

Podocyte involvement in the pathogenesis of preterm-related long-term chronic kidney disease.,"['LuluZhang', 'JunZheng', 'FangruiDing']","With the continuous advancement of neonatal intensive care technology, the survival rate of preterm infants is gradually increasing. However, this improvement in survival is accompanied by long-term prognostic implications in various systems. In the field of renal diseases, current epidemiological data indicate that preterm birth is a significant risk factor for the development of long-term chronic kidney disease (CKD). This not only imposes an economic burden on patients families but also severely impacts their quality of life. Understanding the underlying mechanisms involved in this process could offer potential strategies for early prevention and management of CKD. Although the nephron number hypothesis is currently widely accepted as a mechanism, there has been limited exploration regarding podocytes - one of the most important structures within nephrons - in relation to long-term CKD associated with preterm birth. Therefore, this review aims to summarize current knowledge on how prematurity influences CKD development overall, while specifically focusing on our current understanding of podocytes in relation to prematurity.",kidney disease
Overview of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of URAT1 inhibitors for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.,"['ZihanHou', 'AijinxiuMa', 'JialeMao', 'DanniSong', 'XuZhao']","Hyperuricemia is a common metabolic disease, which is a risk factor for gouty arthritis and ureteral stones and may also lead to cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease (CDK). Therefore, hyperuricemia should be treated early. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (XOIs) and uricosuric agents (UAs), which target uric acid, are two types of medications that are used to treat gout and hyperuricemia. XOIs stop the body from producing excessive uric acid, while UAs eliminate it rapidly via the kidneys. Urate transporter 1 (URAT1) belongs to the organic anion transporter family (OAT) and is specifically localized to the apical membrane of the epithelial cells of proximal tubules. Unlike other organic anion transporter family members, URAT1 identifies and transports organic anions that are primarily responsible for urate transport.
This article reviews the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the existing URAT1 inhibitors to serve as a reference for subsequent drug studies.
The URAT1 inhibitors that are currently used as clinical drugs mainly include dotinurad, benzbromarone, and probenecid. Results indicate that RDEA3170 may be the most promising inhibitor, in addition to SHR4640, URC-102, and MBX-102, which are in the early stages of development.",kidney disease

"Plain language summary of the EMPEROR-Preserved study looking at the effect of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, with and without diabetes.","['JavedButler', 'GerasimosFilippatos']","The EMPEROR-Preserved study looked at the effects of empagliflozin in participants with heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This is when the lower left part of the heart (left ventricle) squeezes normally or near normally but does not fill with enough blood between heartbeats. Therefore, not enough blood is pumped around the body. For this study, HFpEF was defined as a condition in which more than 40% of blood in the left ventricle was pumped around the body. When researchers started the EMPEROR-Preserved study, there was no treatment for HFpEF. Also, researchers did not know if empagliflozin was more or less effective in people with and without diabetes, a condition where there are high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood. This study included participants with HFpEF with and without diabetes to see if empagliflozin had a positive effect on the heart compared with a placebo (a pill that looked like empagliflozin but did not contain any active medication). Nearly 50% of participants had diabetes. The researchers looked at: How many people needed to be hospitalized for heart failure (HF) or died from conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels (cardiovascular disease) If peoples' kidneys worked less over time (the decline in kidney function) The side effects of empagliflozin.
Empagliflozin reduced the risk of either being hospitalized for HF or dying from cardiovascular disease. The decrease in this risk was due to fewer hospitalizations for HF. This was true regardless of whether or not participants had diabetes. Empagliflozin also slowed the decline in kidney function, regardless of whether the participant had diabetes, but the effect was larger in participants with diabetes. There were no differences in side effects in participants taking empagliflozin or placebo, and the results were similar regardless of whether or not participants had diabetes.
The results showed that treatment with empagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalization for HF and there were no major side effects in participants with HFpEF, regardless of whether or not they had diabetes.",kidney disease

Inflammation is an essential component in the process of CKD progression in patients with DM. Diet is a significant determinant of systemic inflammation levels. However, the association between the dietary inflammatory index (DII) and CKD in individuals with DM remains largely unknown; therefore, the aim of this study was to explore whether the DII is linked to the prevalence of CKD in patients with DM. The research method was as follows: first, data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2018 were obtained. There were 7,974 participants in our study.

Astragalus polysaccharide promotes autophagy and alleviates diabetic nephropathy by targeting the lncRNA Gm41268/PRLR pathway.,"['ZedongChen', 'HuiyuLiang', 'XianxinYan', 'QiuerLiang', 'ZhenyuBai', 'TingXie', 'JiaojiaoDai', 'XiaoshanZhao', 'YaXiao']","Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) is a major bioactive component of the Chinese herb astragalus, with well-established protective effects on the kidney. However, the effect of APS on diabetic nephropathy (DN) is unclear.
Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles in kidney samples from control, db/db, and APS-treated db/db mice were evaluated using RNA high-throughput sequencing techniques. Additionally, rat renal tubular epithelial (NRK-52E) cells were cultured in high glucose (HG) media. We inhibited the expression of Gm41268 and prolactin receptor (PRLR) by transfecting NRK-52E cells with Gm41268-targeting antisense oligonucleotides and PRLR siRNA.
We found that APS treatment reduced 24-h urinary protein levels and fasting blood glucose and improved glucose intolerance and pathological renal damage in db/db mice. Furthermore, APS treatment enhanced autophagy and alleviated fibrosis in the db/db mice. We identified a novel lncRNA, Gm41268, which was differentially expressed in the three groups, and the cis-regulatory target gene PRLR. APS treatment induced autophagy by reducing p62 and p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein levels and increasing the LC3 II/I ratio. Furthermore, APS alleviated fibrosis by downregulating fibronectin (FN), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and collagen IV levels. In addition, APS reversed the HG-induced overexpression of Gm41268 and PRLR. Reduction of Gm41268 decreased PRLR expression, restored autophagy, and ameliorated renal fibrosis 
In summary, we demonstrated that the therapeutic effect of APS on DN is mediated via the Gm41268/PRLR pathway. This information contributes to the exploration of bioactive constituents in Chinese herbs as potential treatments for DN.",kidney disease

Renal specific loss of Ferroportin disrupts iron homeostasis and attenuates recovery from acute kidney injury.,"['AbdulSoofi', 'VivieLi', 'Jeffrey ABeamish', 'ShamAbdrabh', 'MawiehHamad', 'Nupur KDas', 'Yatrik MShah', 'Gregory RDressler']","Chronic kidney disease is increasing at an alarming rate and correlates with the increase in diabetes, obesity, and hypertension that disproportionately impacts socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Iron plays essential roles in many biological processes including oxygen transport, mitochondrial function, cell proliferation, and regeneration. However, excess iron induces the generation and propagation of reactive oxygen species, which lead to oxidative stress, cellular damage, and ferroptosis. Iron homeostasis is regulated in part by the kidney through iron resorption from the glomerular filtrate and export into the plasma by ferroportin (FPN). Yet the impact of iron overload in the kidney has not been addressed. To test more directly whether excess iron accumulation is toxic to kidneys, we generated a kidney proximal tubule specific knockout of FPN. Despite significant intracellular iron accumulation in FPN mutant tubules, basal kidney function was not measurably different from wild type kidneys. However, upon induction of acute kidney injury (AKI), FPN mutant kidneys exhibited significantly more damage and failed recovery, evidence for ferroptosis, and increased fibrosis. Thus, disruption of iron export in proximal tubules, leading to iron overload, can significantly impair recovery from AKI and can contribute to progressive renal damage indicative of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Understanding the mechanisms that regulation iron homeostasis in the kidney may provide new therapeutic strategies for progressive kidney disease and other ferroptosis-associated disorders.",kidney disease

Innate immune cellular therapeutics in transplantation.,"['Leah COtt', 'Alex GCuenca']","Successful organ transplantation provides an opportunity to extend the lives of patients with end-stage organ failure. Selectively suppressing the donor-specific alloimmune response, however, remains challenging without the continuous use of non-specific immunosuppressive medications, which have multiple adverse effects including elevated risks of infection, chronic kidney injury, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Efforts to promote allograft tolerance have focused on manipulating the adaptive immune response, but long-term allograft survival rates remain disappointing. In recent years, the innate immune system has become an attractive therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of transplant organ rejection. Indeed, contemporary studies demonstrate that innate immune cells participate in both the initial alloimmune response and chronic allograft rejection and undergo non-permanent functional reprogramming in a phenomenon termed ""trained immunity."" Several types of innate immune cells are currently under investigation as potential therapeutics in transplantation, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells, dendritic cells, regulatory macrophages, natural killer cells, and innate lymphoid cells. In this review, we discuss the features and functions of these cell types, with a focus on their role in the alloimmune response.

Cranial MRI showed irregular enlargement of bilateral ventricles and widening of the distance between the cerebral cortex and temporal meninges. Genetic testing revealed that she has harbored a heterozygous variant of NM_178014.4: c.217A>G (p.Met73Val) in the TUBB gene, which was unreported previously and predicted to be likely pathogenic based on the guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG). The child was diagnosed with Complex cortical dysplasia with other brain malformations 6 (CDCBM6).
CDCBM is a rare and serious disease with great genetic heterogeneity, and CDCBM6 caused by mutations of the TUBB gene is even rarer. Above finding has enriched the variant and phenotypic spectrum of the TUBB gene, and provided important reference for summarizing the genotype-phenotype correlation of the CDCBM6.",kidney disease

A 47-Year-Old Man with Hyperphosphatemia Due to Chronic Renal Failure Treated with Lanthanum Carbonate Tablets Presenting Acutely with Partial Large Bowel Obstruction.,"['QinZhou', 'MengchenYu', 'XinChang', 'ShenglanShang', 'MinLi', 'WeitianXu']","BACKGROUND Hyperphosphatemia is a complication of chronic renal failure (CRF) due to reduction in the glomerular filtration rate. Lanthanum carbonate is a commonly used phosphate binder for patients with CRF and hyperphosphatemia, but has adverse effects if patients are not monitored. This report is of a 47-year-old man with hyperphosphatemia due to CRF treated with lanthanum carbonate tablets who presented acutely with partial large bowel obstruction. The incidence of lanthanum carbonate causing intestinal obstruction is rare, and few cases in the literature have described the course of the disease in detail. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old man diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy underwent hemodialysis treatment and was prescribed 0.5 g/day of chewable lanthanum carbonate tablets. After taking lanthanum carbonate for 5 months, the patient experienced symptoms of decreased bowel movements and exhaustion, which progressively worsened. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple hyperdensities in the large bowel, indicating the presence of lanthanum deposition. Lanthanum carbonate was promptly discontinued. After undergoing enema and catharsis treatment, the large bowel obstruction was relieved, and the hyperdensities in the abdominal CT disappeared. The colonoscopy and histologic examination revealed ulcerations and inflammatory changes in the large bowel mucosa. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the rare association between the use of lanthanum carbonate tablets and intestinal obstruction. Healthcare providers should enhance their vigilance regarding lanthanum carbonate-induced serious gastrointestinal adverse reactions and actively seek to detect lanthanum deposition by abdominal CT or radiography (X-ray). After the occurrence of lanthanum deposition, drug withdrawal and promotion of defecation are primary treatment methods.",kidney disease
Comparative Analysis of Super-Mini Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy Combined with Flexible Ureteroscopic Lithotripsy versus Flexible Ureteroscopic Lithotripsy Alone for Treating Complex Kidney Stones: A Retrospective Study of 205 Patients.,"['QiDing', 'HailiangZhu', 'ZhijiangFan', 'FengLi', 'WenjianTu', 'XiaohuaJin', 'BoFan']","BACKGROUND This retrospective study aimed to compare outcomes from super-mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (SMP) combined with flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy (FURL) and FURL alone in 205 patients with 2.5-4.2 cm diameter complex kidney stones. MATERIAL AND METHODS Between January 2018 and December 2022, 92 patients were treated with SMP combined with FURL (group A), and 113 patients were treated with FURL alone (group B). The stone-free rate (SFR), retreatment ratio, operation time, mean decline in hemoglobin level, postoperative pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and postoperative hospitalization time and complications were analyzed and compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS The SFR 3 days after the operation was 85.87% in group A, which was significantly higher than that in group B (72.57%) (P=0.021). The rate of retreatment in group A (3.26%) was significantly lower than that in group B (10.62%) (P=0.044). The SFR after 90 days was higher in group A (94.57%) than in group B (90.27%) (P=0.254). The mean decrease in hemoglobin, postoperative hospitalization duration, and VAS score 6 hours after the operation were all significantly higher in group A than in group B (P<0.05). However, there was no significant difference in operation time, VAS score at 12 and 24 hours after the operation, and complication rate. CONCLUSIONS In the treatment of complex renal stones, compared with FURL, SMP combined with FURL in the oblique supine lithotomy position has the advantages of a higher early SFR with no increased risk of complications.",kidney disease
Reversible acute blindness in suspected metformin-associated lactic acidosis: a case report.,"['RuiHuang', 'WentaoSun']","Metformin is commonly used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Its multiple advantages include low risk of hypoglycemia, weight neutrality, low cost, and cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. Renal insufficiency is one of the contraindications for its use. Inadvertent prescription in patients with renal insufficiency may lead to metformin-associated lactic acidosis, which brings a high risk of mortality. The early recognition and management of metformin-associated lactic acidosis are essential.
We present the case of a 58-year-old Hui woman with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus with nephropathy and heart disease for which she was treated with metformin, insulin, and heart medications. She developed nausea, vomiting, anion gap metabolic acidosis due to hyperlactatemia, and acute kidney injury. She was hospitalized to receive intravenous hydration and correction of metabolic acidosis after she suddenly developed blindness. The diagnostic workup ruled out central causes and her symptoms resolved briefly after continuous venovenous hemodialysis was initiated, confirming the diagnosis of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.
Metabolic disruption can cause acute blindness. Metabolic acidosis in a patient with a history of metformin intake should suggest the possibility of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, which must be treated immediately, without waiting for the results of other examinations, especially in patients with sudden blindness. Further study of reversible blindness-associated severe metabolic acidosis is needed.",kidney disease
Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells cultured in serum-free medium attenuate acute contrast-induced nephropathy by exerting anti-apoptotic effects.,"['MitsukiKadono', 'AyumuNakashima', 'NaokiIshiuchi', 'KensukeSasaki', 'YoshieMiura', 'SatoshiMaeda', 'AsukaFujita', 'AyanoSasaki', 'ShogoNagamatsu', 'TakaoMasaki']","Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a major clinical problem associated with acute kidney injury during hospitalization. However, effective treatments for CIN are currently lacking. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have protective effects against kidney injury by suppressing inflammation and fibrosis. We previously showed that MSCs cultured in serum-free medium (SF-MSCs) enhance their anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. However, whether SF-MSCs potentiate their anti-apoptotic effects is unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of SF-MSCs on a CIN mouse model.
To create CIN model mice, we removed right kidney at first. One week later, the left renal artery was clamped for 30 min to cause ischemia-reperfusion injury, and mice were injected with iohexol. Then the kidney received 10 Gy of irradiation, and MSCs or SF-MSCs were injected immediately. At 24 h post-injection, mice were sacrificed, and their blood and kidneys were collected to evaluate renal function, DNA damage, and apoptosis. In addition, apoptosis was induced in HEK-293 cells by irradiation and cells were treated with conditioned medium from MSCs or SF-MSCs.
Treatment of CIN model mice with SF-MSCs markedly improved renal function compared with MSCs treatment. Cleaved caspase-3 levels and TUNEL-positive cell numbers were strongly suppressed in CIN model mice treated with SF-MSCs compared with the findings in those treated with MSCs. γH2AX levels, a chromosome damage marker, were reduced by MSCs and further reduced by SF-MSCs. In addition, cleaved caspase-3 in irradiated HEK-293 cells was more strongly suppressed by conditioned medium from SF-MSCs than by that from MSCs. Secretion of epidermal growth factor (EGF) was enhanced by culturing MSCs in serum-free medium. Knockdown of EGF by siRNA attenuated the inhibitory effects of SF-MSCs on CIN-induced renal dysfunction and tubular apoptosis.
These findings strongly suggest that SF-MSCs improve CIN in model mice by exerting anti-apoptotic effects in a paracrine manner. Thus, SF-MSCs represent a potential novel therapy for CIN.",kidney disease
Targeted delivery of organic small-molecule photothermal materials with engineered extracellular vesicles for imaging-guided tumor photothermal therapy.,"['YafangDong', 'PengXia', 'XiaolongXu', 'JingShen', 'YoubinDing', 'YukeJiang', 'HuifangWang', 'XinXie', 'XiaodongZhang', 'WeihuaLi', 'ZhijieLi', 'JigangWang', 'Shan-ChaoZhao']","Imaging-guided photothermal therapy (PTT) for cancers recently gathered increasing focus thanks to its precise diagnosis and potent therapeutic effectiveness. Croconaine (CR) dyes demonstrate potential in expanding utility for near infrared (NIR) dyes in bio-imaging/theranostics. However, reports on CR dyes for PTT are scarce most likely due to the short of the efficacious delivery strategies to achieve specific accumulation in diseased tissues to induce PTT. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are multifunctional nanoparticle systems that function as safe platform for disease theragnostics, which provide potential benefits in extensive biomedical applications. Here, we developed a novel delivery system for photothermal molecules based on a CR dye that exerts photothermal activity through CDH17 nanobody-engineered EVs. The formed CR@E8-EVs showed strong NIR absorption, excellent photothermal performance, good biological compatibility and superb active tumor-targeting capability. The CR@E8-EVs can not only visualize and feature the tumors through CR intrinsic property as a photoacoustic imaging (PAI) agent, but also effectively retard the tumor growth under laser irradiation to perform PTT. It is expected that the engineered EVs will become a novel delivery vehicle of small organic photothermal agents (SOPTAs) in future clinical PTT applications.",kidney disease
A novel mutation of the RPGRIP1L gene in a Chinese boy with Joubert syndrome with oculorenal involvement.,"['QianLi', 'QianyingLiu', 'SuwenLiu', 'LichunYu', 'ZhenleYang', 'CongWang', 'JingWang', 'ShuzhenSun']","Joubert syndrome (JS) is a rare genetically heterogeneous primary ciliopathy characterized by a pathognomonic cerebellar and brainstem malformation, the ""molar tooth sign"", and variable organ involvement (such as eye, kidney, liver, and skeleton). Here, we present a case of JS in a Chinese boy.
An 11-year-old Chinese boy presented with neonatal asphyxiation and hypoxia, strabismus, subsequent developmental delay, ataxia and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Routine blood tests showed severe anemia, increasing blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, elevated parathyroid hormone, hypocalcemia, hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis. Urine tests showed mild proteinuria. Ultrasound showed two small kidneys. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed dysplasia of the cerebellar vermis and extension of the upper cerebellar feet with the ""molar tooth sign"". Genetic analysis showed novel compound heterozygous mutations in the RPGRIP1L gene [p.L447fs*7(p.Leu447fsTer7) and p.G908V (p.Gly908Val)].

Proteomic analysis investigating kidney transplantation outcomes- a scoping review.,"['AnnaRainey', 'Gareth JMcKay', 'JaneEnglish', 'AmmarinThakkinstian', 'Alexander PeterMaxwell', 'MichaelCorr']","Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment option for most patients with end-stage kidney disease given the significantly lower morbidity and mortality rates compared to remaining on dialysis. Rejection and graft failure remain common in transplant recipients with limited improvement in long-term transplant outcomes despite therapeutic advances. There is an unmet need in the development of non-invasive biomarkers that specifically monitor graft function and predict transplant pathologies that affect outcomes. Despite the potential of proteomic investigatory approaches, up to now, no candidate biomarkers of sufficient sensitivity or specificity have translated into clinical use. The aim of this review was to collate and summarise protein findings and protein pathways implicated in the literature to date, and potentially flag putative biomarkers worth validating in independent patient cohorts.
This review followed the Joanna Briggs' Institute Methodology for a scoping review. MedlineALL, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus and Google Scholar databases were searched from inception until December 2022. Abstract and full text review were undertaken independently by two reviewers. Data was collated using a pre-designed data extraction tool.
One hundred one articles met the inclusion criteria. The majority were single-centre retrospective studies of small sample size. Mass spectrometry was the most used technique to evaluate differentially expressed proteins between diagnostic groups and studies identified various candidate biomarkers such as immune or structural proteins.
Putative immune or structural protein candidate biomarkers have been identified using proteomic techniques in multiple sample types including urine, serum and fluid used to perfuse donor kidneys. The most consistent findings implicated proteins associated with tubular dysfunction and immunological regulatory pathways such as leukocyte trafficking. However, clinical translation and adoption of candidate biomarkers is limited, and these will require comprehensive evaluation in larger prospective, multicentre trials.",kidney disease
Fruits and the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: The Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study Cohort.,"['HojunYu', 'Cheol MinLee', 'Seung-WonOh']","To determine the association between type 2 diabetes mellitus and the consumption of various fruits.
The Korean Genome And Epidemiology Study is an ongoing prospective longitudinal cohort study of community dwellers and participants (men and women, aged 40-69 years) recruited from the national health examinee registry of Korea. Their individual consumption habits for 12 different fruit types were recorded using food frequency questionnaires. The fruits were then divided into three groups according to their glycemic indexes and glycemic loads. Participants with extreme caloric intakes, pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney diseases, chronic liver diseases, and ongoing cancer treatments were excluded. The incidence of type 2 diabetes in the cohort was identified through self-reporting and supplemented by glycated hemoglobin and fasting blood glucose levels.
A total of 2,549 cases of type 2 diabetes were documented during 283,033.8 person-years of follow-up. After adjusting for personal, lifestyle, and dietary risk factors for diabetes, the pooled hazard ratio of type 2 diabetes for every serving per week of total whole fruit consumption was 1.02 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-1.05; P=0.3). With mutual adjustment of individual fruits, the pooled hazard ratios of type 2 diabetes for every serving per week were 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89-1.00; P=0.056) for bananas, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.96; P=0.002) for grapes.
Our findings suggest associations between the consumption of certain fruits and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A greater consumption of grapes was significantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in our cohort, but the total amount of fruit consumption was not associated with a reduced risk.",kidney disease
Effect of Membrane Permeance and System Parameters on the Removal of Protein-Bound Uremic Toxins in Hemodialysis.,"['Chun ManChow', 'Aaron HPersad', 'RohitKarnik']","Inadequate clearance of protein-bound uremic toxins (PBUTs) during dialysis is associated with morbidities in chronic kidney disease patients. The development of high-permeance membranes made from materials such as graphene raises the question whether they could enable the design of dialyzers with improved PBUT clearance. Here, we develop device-level and multi-compartment (body) system-level models that account for PBUT-albumin binding (specifically indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate) and diffusive and convective transport of toxins to investigate how the overall membrane permeance (or area) and system parameters including flow rates and ultrafiltration affect PBUT clearance in hemodialysis. Our simulation results indicate that, in contrast to urea clearance, PBUT clearance in current dialyzers is mass-transfer limited: Assuming that the membrane resistance is dominant, raising PBUT permeance from 3 × 10",kidney disease
Impact of acute kidney injury and renal recovery status in deceased donor to kidney transplant outcome: results from the Thai national transplant registry.,"['NuttasithLarpparisuth', 'SupanitNivatvongs', 'KajohnsakNoppakun', 'AdisornLumpaopong', 'CholatipPongskul', 'PeenidaSkulratanasak']","The influence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and renal recovery in deceased donor (DD) on long-term kidney transplant (KT) outcome has not previously been elucidated in large registry study. Our retrospective cohort study included all DDKT performed in Thailand between 2001 and 2018. Donor data was reviewed case by case. AKI was diagnosed according to the KDIGO criteria. Renal recovery was defined if DD had an improvement in AKI to the normal or lower stage. All outcomes were determined until the end of 2020. This study enrolled 4234 KT recipients from 2198 DD. The KDIGO staging of AKI was as follows: stage 1 for 710 donors (32.3%), stage 2 for 490 donors (22.3%) and stage 3 for 342 donors (15.6%). AKI was partial and complete recovery in 265 (17.2%) and 287 (18.6%) before procurement, respectively. Persistent AKI was revealed in 1906 KT of 990 (45%) DD. The ongoing AKI in DD significantly increases the risk of DGF development in the adjusted model (HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.44-1.99; p < 0.001). KT from DD with AKI and partial/complete recovery was associated with a lower risk of transplant loss (log-rank P = 0.04) and recipient mortality (log-rank P = 0.042) than ongoing AKI. KT from a donor with ongoing stage 3 AKI was associated with a higher risk of all-cause graft loss (HR 1.8; 95% CI 1.12-2.88; p = 0.02) and mortality (HR 2.19; 95% CI 1.09-4.41; p = 0.03) than stage 3 AKI with renal recovery. Persistent AKI, but not recovered AKI, significantly increases the risk of DGF. Utilizing kidneys from donors with improving AKI is generally safe. KT from donors with persistent AKI stage 3 results in a higher risk of transplant failure and recipient mortality. Therefore, meticulous pretransplant evaluation of such kidneys and intensive surveillance after KT is recommended.",kidney disease
Hydrangea paniculata coumarins attenuate experimental membranous nephritis by bidirectional interactions with the gut microbiota.,"['ZhaojunLi', 'XingguangZhang', 'HaijieWu', 'ZhilingMa', 'XikunLiu', 'JieMa', 'DongmingZhang', 'LiSheng', 'XiaoguangChen', 'SenZhang']","Coumarins isolated from Hydrangea paniculata (HP) had a renal protective effect in experimental membranous nephritis (MN), but the mechanisms are not clear. Currently, we investigate whether the modulation of gut dysbiosis by HP contributes to its renal protection. Experimental MN rats were treated with HP for six weeks. Fecal 16S rDNA sequencing and metabolomics were performed. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was used for the evaluation study. The results demonstrate that deteriorated renal function and gut dysbiosis are found in MN rats, as manifested by a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and reduced diversity and richness, but both changes were reversed by HP treatment. Reduced gut dysbiosis is correlated with improved colonic integrity and lower endotoxemia in HP-treated rats. HP normalized the abnormal level of fecal metabolites by increasing short-chain fatty acid production and hindering the production of uremic toxin precursors. FMT of HP-treated feces to MN animals moderately reduced endotoxemia and albuminuria. Moreover, major coumarins in HP were only biotransformed into more bioactive 7-hydroxycoumarin by gut microbiota, which strengthened the effect of HP in vivo. Depletion of the gut microbiota partially abolished its renal protective effect. In conclusion, the bidirectional interaction between HP and the gut microbiota contributes to its beneficial effect.",kidney disease
Value of radiomics-based two-dimensional ultrasound for diagnosing early diabetic nephropathy.,"['XueeSu', 'ShuLin', 'YinqiongHuang']","Despite efforts to diagnose diabetic nephropathy (DN) using biochemical data or ultrasound imaging separately, a significant gap exists regarding the development of integrated models combining both modalities for enhanced early DN diagnosis. Therefore, we aimed to assess the ability of machine learning models containing two-dimensional ultrasound imaging and biochemical data to diagnose early DN in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This retrospective study included 219 patients, divided into a training or test group at an 8:2 ratio. Features were selected using minimum redundancy maximum relevance and random forest-recursive feature elimination. The predictive performance of the models was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for sensitivity, specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, F1 score, and accuracy. K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and logistic regression models could diagnose early DN, with AUC values of 0.94, 0.85, and 0.85 in the training cohort and 0.91, 0.84, and 0.84 in the test cohort, respectively. Early DN diagnosing using two-dimensional ultrasound-based radiomics models can potentially revolutionize T2DM patient care by enabling proactive interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Our integrated approach showcases the power of artificial intelligence in medical imaging, enhancing early disease detection strategies with far-reaching applications across medical disciplines.",kidney disease
Pathology of hereditary renal cell carcinoma syndromes: Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).,"['Miranda EMachacek', 'Chin-LeeWu', 'Kristine MCornejo']","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disease characterized by hamartomatous tumors involving multiple organs such as the brain, skin, heart, lung and kidney. TSC is caused by inactivating mutations in TSC1/TSC2, which encodes hamartin and tuberin, respectively, and forms a complex that regulates mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), resulting in cell overgrowth and oncogenesis. Since a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in TSC relates to chronic kidney disease and the ability to preserve renal function, this review describes the important pathologic findings in TSC-associated renal neoplasms and their correlating sporadic counterparts. The most common renal tumor in TSC patients are AMLs, followed by a heterogeneous spectrum of renal epithelial tumors, which may provide clues to establishing a diagnosis of TSC.",kidney disease

The Anemia Working Group of the Sociedad Española de Nefrología conducted a Delphi study among experts in anemia in CKD to agree on relevant unanswered questions by existing evidence. The RAND/UCLA consensus methodology was used. We defined 15 questions with a PICO structure, followed by a review in scientific literature databases. Statements to each question were developed based on that literature review. Nineteen experts evaluated them using an iterative Two-Round Delphi-like process. Sixteen statements were agreed in response to 8 questions related to iron deficiency and supplementation with Fe (impact and management of iron deficiency with or without anemia, iron deficiency markers, safety of i.v. iron) and 7 related to erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and/or hypoxia-inducible factor stabilizers (HIF), reaching consensus on all of them (individualization of the Hb objective, impact and management of resistance to ESA, ESA in the immediate post-transplant period and HIF stabilizers: impact on ferrokinetics, interaction with inflammation and cardiovascular safety).

Systemic lupus erythematosus and damage: What has changed over the past 20 years?,"['CarolinaMuñoz-Grajales', 'Esin BesteYilmaz', 'ElisabetSvenungsson', 'ZahiTouma']","The young age of onset and chronic/relapsing nature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) make SLE patients prone to develop and accrue organ damage as a result of long-standing disease activity and side effects of treatment. There is a growing interest in objectifying damage and identifying its risk factors. Still, the lack of therapeutic alternatives has led to difficulties in avoiding immunosuppressives particularly corticosteroids, which have been implicated in a large spectrum of organ damage in SLE patients. Moreover, it continues to be very challenging to determine what actually causes damage in different organ-systems. Cardiovascular disease continues to be one of the leading types of damage in patients with SLE, reported as early as 1976. Since then, many researchers have focused on identifying SLE or treatment-related and traditional risk factors. The same considerations are valid for other conditions, such as the occurrence of metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, susceptibility to infections, etc. On the other hand, diverse risk factors contribute to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in SLE. Most evidence suggests that high initial levels of serum creatinine, hypocomplementemia, nephrotic range proteinuria, concomitant uncontrolled hypertension, Black and Hispanic ancestry, non-adherence to treatment, and biopsy findings such as diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis (LN), a high chronicity index, tubular atrophy, and tubulointerstitial inflammation are risk factors for progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in LN. While cardiovascular disease, CKD and infections are leading causes of mortality in patients with SLE, hospitalizations are caused mostly by SLE disease flares and infections. Cognitive impairment and mood disorders are common in SLE but continue to impose a challenge on how to measure, manage and decipher the underlying pathogenesis. Nevertheless, they have a great impact on SLE patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and social functioning. Also, skin manifestations, such as alopecia and scaring, cataracts, and sicca symptoms result in a significant decrease in HRQoL. In light of recent developments in SLE treatment, we can expect to enter a period of new-age targeted therapies that will enable us to reduce disease activity and glucocorticoid usage further and positively alter the trajectory of damage development and accrual in SLE.",kidney disease
Risk-stratified screening for the early detection of kidney cancer.,"['Sabrina HRossi', 'HannahHarrison', 'Juliet AUsher-Smith', 'Grant DStewart']","Earlier detection and screening for kidney cancer has been identified as a key research priority, however the low prevalence of the disease in unselected populations limits the cost-effectiveness of screening. Risk-stratified screening for kidney cancer may improve early detection by targeting high-risk individuals whilst limiting harms in low-risk individuals, potentially increasing the cost-effectiveness of screening. A number of models have been identified which estimate kidney cancer risk based on both phenotypic and genetic data, and while several of the former have been shown to identify individuals at high-risk of developing kidney cancer with reasonable accuracy, current evidence does not support including a genetic component. Combined screening for lung cancer and kidney cancer has been proposed, as the two malignancies share some common risk factors. A modelling study estimated that using lung cancer risk models (currently used for risk-stratified lung cancer screening) could capture 25% of patients with kidney cancer, which is only slightly lower than using the best performing kidney cancer-specific risk models based on phenotypic data (27%-33%). Additionally, risk-stratified screening for kidney cancer has been shown to be acceptable to the public. The following review summarises existing evidence regarding risk-stratified screening for kidney cancer, highlighting the risks and benefits, as well as exploring the management of potential harms and further research needs.",kidney disease

First-phase ejection fraction (EF1) a novel measure of early systolic function may be a more sensitive marker of left ventricular dysfunction than other markers in children with CKD.
To examine whether EF1 is reduced in children with CKD.
Children from 4C and HOT-KID studies were stratified according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). EF1 was calculated from the fraction of LV volume ejected up to the time of peak aortic flow velocity.
EF1 was measured in children aged 10.9±3.7 (mean±SD) years, 312 with CKD and 63 healthy controls. EF1 was lower, whilst overall EF was similar in those with CKD compared to controls and decreased across stages of CKD (29.3±3.7%, 23.5±4.5%, 19.8±4.0%, 18.5±5.1% and 16.7±6.6% in controls, CKD 1, 2, 3 and ≥4, respectively, p<0.001). The relationship of EF1 to eGFR persisted after adjustment for relevant confounders (p<0.001). The effect size for association of measures of LV structure or function with eGFR (SD change per unit change in eGFR) was greater for EF1 (β=0.365, p<0.001) than other measures: LVMi (β=-0.311), RWT (β=-0.223), E/e' (β=-0.147), and e' (β=0.141) after adjustment for confounders in children with CKD.
Children with CKD exhibit a marked and progressive decline in EF1 with falling eGFR. This suggests that EF1 is a more sensitive marker of LV dysfunction when compared to other structural or functional measures and early LV systolic function a key feature in the pathophysiology of cardiac dysfunction in CKD.",kidney disease
Effect of osteosarcopenia on longitudinal mortality risk and chronic kidney disease progression in older adults.,"['YutaNakano', 'ShintaroMandai', 'ShotaroNaito', 'TamamiFujiki', 'YutaroMori', 'FumiakiAndo', 'TakayasuMori', 'KoichiroSusa', 'SoichiroIimori', 'EiseiSohara', 'ShinichiUchida']","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes a progressive loss of muscle and bone mass, which frequently overlap with and affect clinical outcomes. However, the impact of sarcopenia, low bone mineral density (BMD; osteopenia or osteoporosis), and osteosarcopenia (sarcopenia and low BMD) on CKD progression is yet to be determined. We aimed to address these issues in patients with CKD without kidney replacement therapy (KRT).
This prospective cohort study included 251 outpatients aged ≥65 years with CKD without KRT enrolled in our hospital between June 2016 and March 2017. Sarcopenia was defined according to the 2014 criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS), and low BMD was defined as a T-score of ≤-1.0. The patients were divided into four groups: normal (no sarcopenia/normal BMD), only low BMD (no sarcopenia/low BMD), only sarcopenia (sarcopenia/normal BMD), and osteosarcopenia (sarcopenia/low BMD). The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause deaths, initiating KRT, and admissions owing to major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACEs). The secondary outcome was a kidney composite outcome that included a 30 % reduction in creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and initiating KRT. The outcome risk was determined using the Cox regression models adjusted for potential confounders.
Median age (25th-75th percentile) and eGFR of the outpatients (35 % women) were 76 (69-81) years and 32.1 (20.8-41.7) ml/min/1.73 m
Osteosarcopenia was associated with poor survival and kidney outcomes in older patients with CKD. Low HGS, which is common in patients with osteosarcopenia and CKD, was associated with increased mortality risk and kidney function decline. These findings can help the risk prediction and pathogenesis of the kidney-bone-muscle axis and improving muscle strength can help mitigate CKD progression.",kidney disease
Changes in Natriuretic Peptide Levels and Subsequent Kidney Function Decline in the SPRINT Trial.,"['Simon BAscher', 'Jarett DBerry', 'RonitKatz', 'James Ade Lemos', 'NishaBansal', 'Pranav SGarimella', 'Stein IHallan', 'NicholasWettersten', 'Vasantha KJotwani', 'Anthony AKilleen', 'Joachim HIx', 'Michael GShlipak']","Novel approaches to assessing kidney disease risk during hypertension treatment are needed given the uncertainty in how intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering impacts kidney outcomes. We determined whether longitudinal N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) measurements during hypertension treatment are associated with kidney function decline.
Prospective observational study.
& Participants: 8005 Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) participants with NT-proBNP measurements at baseline and 1 year.
1-year change in NT-proBNP categorized as ≥25% decrease, ≥25% increase, and <25% change (stable).
Annualized change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and ≥30% decline in eGFR.
Linear mixed-effect and logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of change in NT-proBNP with subsequent annualized change in eGFR and ≥30% decline in eGFR, respectively. Analyses stratified by baseline chronic kidney disease (CKD) status.
Compared with stable 1-year NT-proBNP levels, a ≥25% decrease in NT-proBNP was associated with slower decline in eGFR in those with CKD (adjusted difference [% per year] =1.09 [95% CI, 0.35-1.83]) and without CKD (adjusted difference [% per year] =0.51 [95% CI, 0.21-0.81]; P for interaction =0.4). Meanwhile, ≥25% increase in NT-proBNP in those with CKD was associated with faster decline in eGFR (adjusted difference [% per year] = -1.04 [95% CI, -1.72 to -0.36]) and risk of ≥30% decline in eGFR (adjusted odds ratio: 1.44 [95% CI, 1.06-1.96]); associations were stronger in those with CKD versus without CKD (P for interactions =0.01 and <0.001, respectively). Relationships were similar irrespective of the randomized BP arm in SPRINT (P for interactions >0.2).
Persons with diabetes and proteinuria > 1 g/d were excluded.
Changes in NT-proBNP during BP treatment are independently associated with subsequent kidney function decline, particularly in people with CKD. Studies should assess if dynamic NT-proBNP may be useful in monitoring kidney risk during hypertension treatment.",kidney disease
Toxicity study of compound granules of Hedyotis diffusa: Acute toxicity and long-term toxicity.,"['Da-HongChen', 'Peng-JuanMao', 'Wen-JingDiao', 'QinLi']","The clinical efficacy of the hospital preparation compound granules of Hedyotis diffusa (CGHD), which is composed of Hedyotis diffusa Willd, Smilax china L., Solanum lyratum Thunb., has accumulated a good reputation over the past decades. However, because it is a hospital preparation, few researchers have paid attention to it, resulting in a lack of systematic basic research studies. Thus, it is not clear whether there are safety concerns that restrict its clinical application, and toxicological evaluation of CGHD is needed.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of CGHD by conducting acute toxicity and long-term toxicity experiments, with the objective of providing evidence for its clinical safety and a theoretical foundation for its clinical application.
KM mice were selected for the acute toxicity experiment and were administered water or CGHD-E 3 times within 24 h. The reactions of the animals to CGHD treatment were observed and recorded within 1 h after administration and then once a day for 14 consecutive days. SD rats were selected to conduct the long-term toxicity experiment. The drug-treated groups were administered different doses of CGHD-E, which were equivalent to 10 times, 20 times and 50 times the clinical dose in humans. The rats were administered the drug for 28 consecutive days. After 28 days, the animals were sacrificed, and routine blood tests, blood coagulation function analysis, liver and kidney function tests, and glycolipid metabolism related tests were conducted. The major organs of the rats were collected to calculate organ coefficients and perform hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining.
In the CGHD-E acute toxicity experiment, the drug-treated groups did not show adverse reactions or poisoning symptoms, and the maximum tolerated dose of CGHD-E in mice was greater than 45.072 g/kg. In the long-term toxicity experiment, drug-treated rats generally exhibited a good condition, but continuous administration decreased on body weight and food intake, especially in male rats. Coagulation function alterations and the impact on the liver during long-term drug administration were also assessed, which should be emphasized in clinical applications. No significant toxic effects were observed according to routine blood tests or test of liver and kidney function, glucose and lipid metabolism, or ion metabolism.
The results of this study showed that CGHD was nontoxic or had low toxicity, providing not only a scientific basis for its clinical application, determining the appropriate clinical dose and monitoring clinical toxicity but also theoretical support for subsequent clinical drug trials.",kidney disease

We performed a retrospective multicenter cross-sectional study involving 1,409 adult outpatients with T1DM, in whom hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and fibrosis (FIB)-4 index were calculated for non-invasively detecting hepatic steatosis (defined by HSI > 36), with or without coexisting significant fibrosis (FIB-4 index ≥ 1.3 or < 1.3). CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m
Patients with MASLD and significant fibrosis (n = 93) had a remarkably higher prevalence of CKD and diabetic retinopathy than their counterparts with MASLD without fibrosis (n = 578) and those without steatosis (n = 738). After adjustment for sex, diabetes duration, hemoglobin A1c, hypertension, and use of antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medications, patients with SLD and significant fibrosis had a higher risk of prevalent CKD (adjusted-odds ratio 1.76, 95 % confidence interval 1.05-2.96) than those without steatosis. Patients with MASLD without fibrosis had a higher risk of prevalent retinopathy (adjusted-odds ratio 1.49, 95 % CI 1.13-1.46) than those without steatosis.
This is the largest cross-sectional study showing that MASLD with and without coexisting significant fibrosis was associated, independently of potential confounders, with an increased risk of prevalent CKD and retinopathy in adults with T1DM.",kidney disease
"High Metabolite Concentrations in Portal Venous Blood as a Possible Mechanism for Microbiota Effects on the Immune System, and Western Diseases.","['QuanboWang', 'Charles RMackay']","We show that the gut bacterial metabolites, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are present at exceptionally high concentrations in the portal venous circulation, particularly small blood vessels that emanate from colonic mucosa. Likely, many other metabolites will be present at high concentrations. Herein we propose a model for immune conditioning, whereby metabolites such as butyrate affect immune cells as they pass through the portal venous system. Deficiency of SCFA would lead to pro-inflammatory immune cell skewing through insufficient G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling, or lack of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition. Such pro-inflammatory immune cells may travel to tissues such as the brain, the lung, the kidney etc and promote disease. This model helps explain how the gut microbiome may be affecting peripheral immune cells, and consequently Western lifestyle diseases, most of which are immune based, in tissues remote from the gut.",kidney disease

"Evaluation of the CKD-EPI 2021 creatinine equation using laboratory data: Considerations for practice changes among clinical laboratories in British Columbia, Canada.","['Roy Yu-WeiChen', 'JunyanShi']","Clinical laboratories in British Columbia, Canada implemented the CKD-EPI 2009 equation without the race variable for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting since 2014. As more clinical laboratories adopt the new CKD-EPI 2021 equation, the study aims to compare these two race-free CKD-EPI eGFR equations using the laboratory data from a large tertiary hospital in BC and evaluate the impact on reclassification of eGFR category.
Serum/plasma creatinine results and demographic data were collected from Vancouver General Hospital laboratory. The CKD-EPI 2009 without the race variable and CKD-EPI 2021 equations were computed. eGFR and its distributions were compared and reclassification of eGFR category was assessed across the full cohort and in specific patient populations.
The analysis included 58,763 patients. The median age was 57 years, with women comprising 51 % of the population. The median of eGFR changed from 85 to 90 mL/min/1.73 m
Using laboratory data representative of local populations, we observed an overall positive shift to higher eGFR, with 11.86 % of individuals having improved eGFR categories based on the CKD-EPI 2021 equation. This study provides insights into clinical implications at both the individual and population levels.

This observational study included 392 patients. Patients filled out the Numerical Rating Scale, Verbal Rating Scale, and Visual Analogue Scale, showing the severity of pruritis. UF volumes in the last 12 sessions were recorded and averaged.
The rate of patients with pruritis was between 59.4% and 67.5% in the three scales. In three pruritis scales, the severity of pruritis, age, body mass index (BMI), UF volume, and UF volume/body weight ratio were positively correlated. UF volume/body weight ratio, age, and BMI were independent predictors of pruritis severity.

Comparative proteomics analysis of kidney in chicken infected by infectious bronchitis virus.,"['MengjiaoHuang', 'XueweiZheng', 'YunjingZhang', 'RuohanWang', 'XiaonaWei']","The gamma coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is known to cause an acute and highly contagious infectious disease in poultry. Here, this study aimed to investigate the impact of virulent or avirulent IBV infection on the avian host by conducting proteomics with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) in the kidneys of IBV-infected chickens. The results revealed 267, 489, and 510 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the chicken kidneys at 3, 5, and 7 days postinfection (dpi), respectively, when infected with the GD17/04 strain, which is a highly nephrogenic strain and belongs to the 4/91 genotype. In contrast, the attenuated 4/91 vaccine resulted in the identification of 144, 175, and 258 DEPs at 3, 5, and 7 dpi, respectively. Functional enrichment analyses indicated distinct expression profiles between the 2 IBV strains. Upon GD17/04 infection, metabolic pathways respond initially in the early stage (3 dpi) and immune-related signaling pathways respond in the middle and late stages (5 and 7 dpi). The 4/91 vaccine elicited a completely opposite response compared to the GD17/04 infection. Among all DEPs, 62 immune-related DEPs were focused on and found to be mainly enriched in the type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway and involved in humoral and cellular immunity. Notably, key molecules in the IFN-I signaling pathway including MDA5, LGP2, and TBK1 may serve as regulatory targets of IBV. Overall, this study highlights similarities and discrepancies in the patterns of protein expression at different stages of infection with virulent and avirulent IBV strains, with the IFN-I signaling pathway emerging as a critical response to IBV infection.",kidney disease
Intravenous volume expansion to prevent contrast-associated acute kidney injury.,"['CarloBriguori', 'AntoniettaDi Iorio', 'GuidoRiviezzo', 'StefanoScafuri', 'AmeliaFocaccio', 'LucaPaolucci', 'ValeriaCavaliere', 'FrancescaDi Micco', 'EnricaMariano', 'RobertoCelotto', 'FrancescoValenti', 'Giuseppe MassimoSangiorgi', 'GiuseppeBiondi-Zoccai']","Several volume expansion protocols have been proposed to prevent contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). The aim of our study was to seek the ideal intravenous volume expansion to prevent CA-AKI in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing invasive cardiovascular procedures.
We analyzed 1927 CKD patients enrolled in 6 studies that took place from September 15, 2000 to June 6, 2019. Four volume expansion regiments were included: (1) conventional group (n=625); (2) bicarbonate group (n=255); (3) left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-guided group (n=355); and (4) urine flow rate-guided group (n=500).
CA-AKI (serum creatinine increase ≥0.3 mg/dL at 48 hours) occurred in 224 (11%) patients. In patients with CA-AKI, volume expansion was lower (2090 ± 1382 mL vs 2551 ± 1716 mL; P less than .001) and acute pulmonary edema occurred more often (3.5% vs 0.29%; P less than .001). By ROC curve analysis, an absolute volume expansion greater than or equal to 1430 mL (AUC = 0.70) and a volume expansion to contrast media volume ratio greater than or equal to 17 (AUC = 0.57) were the best thresholds for freedom from CA-AKI.
In our comprehensive pooled analysis, an absolute volume expansion greater than or equal to 1430 mL and a volume expansion to contrast media volume ratio greater than or equal to 17 are the best dichotomous thresholds for CA-AKI prevention. These cutoffs should be formally tested in a dedicated trial as a pragmatic means to prevent CA-AKI.",kidney disease

However, the availability of emerging options in global health care systems can vary. We sought to describe the integration and usage of systemic therapies for mRCC in Canada since 2011.
We included patients with mRCC enrolled in the Canadian Kidney Cancer Information System, a prospective cohort of patients from 14 Canadian academic centers, who received systemic therapy from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2021. Patients were stratified by treatment era (cohort 1: 2011-2015, cohort 2: 2016-2021). Stacked bar charts were used to present treatment proportions; Sankey diagrams were used to show the evolution of treatment sequencing between the two cohorts.
Four thousand one hundred seven patients were diagnosed with mRCC, of whom 2,752 (67%) received systemic therapy. Among these patients, mean age was 64 years, 74% were male, 75% had clear cell histology, and International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk classification was favorable, intermediate, and poor in 16%, 56%, and 28%, respectively. Utilization of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI)-based treatments has increased in Canada and reflects global and local patterns of approval and adoption. The use of therapies after doublet ICI has mostly shifted toward vascular endothelial growth factor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGF-TKIs) that were previously used in first line with subsequent treatments reflecting approved and available agents after previous VEGF-TKI. Clinical trial participation among patients who received systemic therapy was 18% in first, 21% in second, and 24% in third line.
In Canada's publicly funded health care system, availability of standard mRCC therapies broadly reflects access from government-funded clinical trials and compassionate access program sources. In an evolving therapeutic landscape, ongoing advocacy is required to continue to facilitate patient access to efficacious therapies.",kidney disease
Development of a new model of insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes and association with mortality.,"['StefanoCiardullo', 'Alessandro RobertoDodesini', 'GiuseppeLepore', 'AnnaCorsi', 'CristianaScaranna', 'GianlucaPerseghin', 'RobertoTrevisan']","Despite being one of the major drivers of diabetes incidence, the degree of insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is not usually evaluated in clinical practice or in large epidemiologic studies.
To identify a model of insulin sensitivity using widely available clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with T2D and evaluate its association with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
140 patients with T2D underwent a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp to measure total body glucose disposal rate (mg kg-1 min-1). We used demographic, clinical and common laboratory parameters to estimate insulin sensitivity (IS) via stepwise linear regression on 85 patients (training cohort) and validated it in the remaining 55 (validation cohort). The identified equation was then applied to 3553 patients with T2D from the 1999-2010 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to evaluate its association with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality up to December 2015.
The best model included triglycerides, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, albumin excretion rate and body mass index. The identified IS score correlated well with the clamp-derived glucose disposal rate in both the training (r = 0.77, p < 0.001) and the validation (r = 0.74, p < 0.001) cohorts. In the NHANES cohort, after a median follow-up of 8.3 years, 1054 patients died, 265 of cardiovascular causes. In a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for age, sex, race-ethnicity, education, cigarette smoke, total cholesterol, chronic kidney disease, blood pressure, prevalent cardiovascular disease and alcohol consumption, a higher estimated IS was associated with a lower risk of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.
We propose a new model of IS in patients with T2D based on readily available clinical and laboratory data. Its potential applications are in in both diagnosis as well as prognostication.",kidney disease

In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the presence of sub-clinical coronary artery pathology in people with type 2 diabetes, free of overt CVD. Using multimodal imaging, we assessed the coronary microcalcification activity (18F-sodium fluoride positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), plaque inflammation (64Cu- DOTATATE PET/CT) and myocardial flow reserve (82Rubidium PET/CT). The study population consisted of 90 participants, stratified by albuminuria; 60 had historic or current albuminuria (urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) ≥ 30 mg/g)), and 30 had normoalbuminuria (UACR < 30 mg/g). We demonstrated that any albuminuria (historic or current) was associated with a more severe phenotype, in particularly higher levels of microcalcifications and impaired myocardial microvascular function, however, coronary inflammation activity was similar in people with and without albuminuria. Our findings establish a potential underlying mechanism connecting cardiovascular and kidney diseases and could indicate the initial stages of the cardiorenal syndrome.",kidney disease

Overall survival, time on treatment and time to next treatment were evaluated using Kaplan-Meiermethod.
Totally, 4183 received tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy, 1555 received ipilimumab plus nivolumab, and 559 received axitinib plus pembrolizumab. Median time on treatment was 2.5 months for the tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy cohort, 5.4 months for the ipilimumab plus nivolumab cohort, and 8.3 months for the pembrolizumab plus axitinib cohort. Median time to next treatment was 16.6 months for both the tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy and ipilimumab plus nivolumab cohorts, and 22.1 months for the pembrolizumab plus axitinib cohort. Median overall survival was 42.2 months for the tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy cohort, 39.7monthsfor the ipilimumab plus nivolumab cohort, and not reached for the pembrolizumab plus axitinib cohort. In comparison with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy cohort, patients in the pembrolizumab plus axitinib cohort showed survival benefit (log-rank p = 0.0168) in overall survival, but not the case in the ipilimumab plus nivolumab cohort.

Autosomal Recessive Adolescent Syndromic Nephronophthisis Caused by a Novel Compound Heterozygous Pathogenic Variant.,"['OyintayoAjiboye', 'Jaime EVengoechea', 'RituGupta', 'KobaLomashvili']","BACKGROUND Nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive ciliopathy involving mutations in primary cilium genes, is characterized by chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis and a defective urine concentrating capacity. It accounts for about 5% of renal failure in children and adolescents and usually progresses to end-stage renal disease before the age of 30 years. Nephronophthisis is associated with extrarenal manifestations, including retinitis pigmentosa in Senior-Loken syndrome (SLS), and liver fibrosis in 10-20% of cases. While some presenting patterns could be characteristic, patients may have atypical presentation, making diagnosis difficult. Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is the predominant feature on histology and as such, diagnosis depends mostly on genetic testing. Despite advances in renal genomics over the years with a better understanding of primary cilia and ciliary theory, about 40% of nephronophthisis cases go undiagnosed. As the underlying genetic etiologies are not fully understood, morphologic pathologic findings are non-specific, and treatment options are limited to dialysis and transplantation. CASE REPORT We describe a unique case of a patient with adolescent nephronophthisis who presented with advanced chronic kidney disease and severe pancytopenia, who progressed to end-stage renal disease at the age of 19, and was found to have syndromic nephronophthisis with compound heterozygous inheritance. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights the atypical presentation patterns that can be seen in syndromic nephronophthisis, the importance of genetic diagnosis when there is a high index of suspicion, and the need to further study genetic variants to better understand and diagnose the disease and to develop targeted therapy.",kidney disease

The recent approval of the disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) l-glutamine, crizanlizumab, and voxelotor underscores the need to understand the uptake of DMTs in the current treatment landscape.
To explore characteristics that may be associated with DMT use and to describe observed patterns of yearly DMT use from 2014 to 2021.
This cross-sectional study used administrative claims data from Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart Database from January 1, 2014, to September 30, 2021, to identify adults and children with SCD. Data were analyzed from August 1, 2022, to August 28, 2023.
Use of DMTs.
Patient characteristics across groups with varying patterns of DMT use and yearly patterns of prescription fills for hydroxyurea, crizanlizumab, voxelotor, and l-glutamine.

Inconsistent users had a higher prevalence of vaso-occlusive crises (mean [SD], 3.7 [4.7]), splenic complications (6 of 144 [4.2%]), pulmonary complications (36 of 144 [25.0%]), kidney disease (21 of 144 [14.6%]), acute chest syndrome (18 of 144 [12.5%]), and health care visits (eg, mean [SD] inpatient visits, 7.0 [10.7]) compared with the other use groups. Non-DMT users had the lowest prevalence of vaso-occlusive crises (mean [SD], 0.8 [2.4]), acute chest syndrome (109 of 3712 [2.9%]), and inpatient (mean [SD], 2.0 [6.6]) and emergency department (mean [SD], 0.7 [3.1]) visits and the highest proportion of adults 65 years and older (593 of 3712 [16.0%]). In sample B (6387 beneficiaries with SCD), hydroxyurea use modestly increased from 428 of 2188 participants (19.6%) in 2014 to 701 of 2880 (24.3%) in 2021. Use of l-glutamine increased briefly but gradually decreased throughout the study period. In 2021, out of 2880 participants, 102 (3.5%) had at least 1 fill for crizanlizumab and 131 (4.6%) had at least 1 fill for voxelotor. Overall, total DMT use increased from 428 of 2188 participants (19.6%) in 2014 to 815 of 2880 patients (28.3%) in 2021.
In this cross-sectional analysis of adults and children with SCD, uptake of DMTs remained low from 2014 to 2021, despite the approval of newer therapies. Notable differences in patient characteristics across varied DMT exposure types necessitate further exploration into factors that facilitate DMT use and the creation of strategies to enhance DMT uptake.",kidney disease

In a total of 282 (males 145, females 137) healthy infants (n = 30), prepubertal (n = 147), pubertal (n = 59), and postpubertal (n = 46), and in twenty patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLH, age 10.2 ± 5.6 years) serum phosphate (automated analyzer), and plasma intact FGF23 (immunochemiluminescent sandwich assay, DiaSorin) concentrations were measured.
Intact FGF23 concentrations were higher in healthy infants than in prepubertal (P < 0.01) and postpubertal subjects (P < 0.05); pubertal subjects showed higher values (P < 0.05) than postpubertal subjects. Serum phosphate concentrations were higher (P < 0.001) in healthy infants than in prepubertal, pubertal, and postpubertal subjects. Pubertal subjects had higher (P < 0.001) serum phosphate concentrations than postpubertal subjects. Intact FGF23 and serum phosphate concentrations did not differ (P = NS) by sex, age of menarche, and time after menarche. In healthy subjects, there was no correlation between intact FGF23 and serum phosphate concentrations. Intact FGF23 concentrations were higher (P < 0.0001) in patients with XLH than in healthy subjects according to chronological age and pubertal development. In all patients, intact FGF23 concentrations were above 40 pg/mL; intact FGF23 concentrations were inversely correlated with serum phosphate concentrations (r = -0.65; P < 0.01).
In healthy subjects, chronological age and puberty were main determinants of intact FGF23 concentrations. Intact FGF23 concentrations may be a useful marker for the early diagnosis of XLH in pediatric patients.",kidney disease
Cardiovascular and Renal Benefit of Novel Non-steroidal Mineralocorticoid Antagonists in Patients with Diabetes.,['UlrichKintscher'],"Novel non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists (MRAs) are a new class of drugs blocking adverse MR-mediated effects with an improved benefit-risk profile compared to steroidal MRAs. This review will provide information on the preclinical and clinical pharmacology of this new drug class and will discuss their future clinical applications in patients with cardiorenal disease.
Non-steroidal MRAs such as esaxerenone, AZD9977, apararenone, ocedurenone (KBP-5074), and finerenone are newly approved or in clinical development for patients with cardiorenal disease including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension -/+ CKD or heart failure. Unlike steroidal MRAs, non-steroidal MRAs do not induce sex hormone-related side effects and appear to mediate a lower risk of hyperkalemia while maintaining compelling clinical efficacy. Recently, new data from several clinical trials with non-steroidal MRAs have been published (e.g., FIDELIO-DKD, FIGARO-DKD, ESAX-DN, and BLOCK-CKD), and additional studies are currently underway (e.g., FINEARTS-HF and CLARION-CKD). These data and the clinical scientific basis for the ongoing studies will be discussed. Non-steroidal MRAs have been extensively explored in diabetic kidney disease. Selected candidates of this drug class reduced UACR in patients with varying degrees of CKD and T2D and have shown convincing cardiorenal protection, in particular finerenone. Furthermore, finerenone is currently tested in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.",kidney disease
Analysis of hemorrhage upon ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy in China: a retrospective study.,"['Fang-FangLi', 'Yu-XiaGuan', 'Tong-XinLi', 'DiJiang', 'Zi-XiaHe', 'PengXia', 'Xue-SongZhao']","Ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy (PRB) has been considered as a golden standard for CKD diagnosis and is employed to identify potential therapeutic targets since 1950s. Post-biopsy hemorrhage is the most common complication, while severe bleeding complication might cause nephrectomy or death. Therefore, how to reduce the occurrence of complications while ensuring the success of PRB is always a clinical research topic.
This study retrospectively collected and established a renal biopsy database of each patient who underwent ultrasound-guided PRB at a tertiary teaching hospital from September 2017 to December 2020 through the Health Information System. All the data were statistically processed by SPSS software.
A total of 1146 patients underwent PRB for various reasons. The overall rate of post-biopsy hemorrhage was 37.70% (432/1146). Of those bleedings, minor bleeding after PRB was found in 337 (29.41%), middle bleeding 84 (7.33%), major bleeding 11 (0.96%). Besides that, there were 96 patients (8.38%) reported their discomfort symptoms. There was no death. Females were at significantly increased risk of hemorrhagic complication than males (OR = 2.017, CI = 1.531-2.658). While the risk for hemorrhagic complication significantly decreased as BMI and platelet before renal biopsy increased (OR = 0.956, CI = 0.924-0.989; OR = 0.998, CI = 0.996-1.000). As the APTT time prolonged, the risk for hemorrhagic complication significantly increased (OR = 1.072, CI = 1.023-1.123). Those patients whose albumin were higher, also had higher risk for hemorrhagic complication than other patients (OR = 1.020, CI = 1.000-1.041). Specifically, postoperative urination within 4 h increased the risk for hemorrhagic complication (OR = 1.741, CI = 1.176-2.576).
Our analysis finds that the incidence of post-biopsy bleeding complication is 37.70%, and its risk is associated with female, lower BMI, lower platelet before renal biopsy, prolonged APTT, higher albumin, and postoperative urination within 4 h. The findings highlighted the importance of perioperative management for renal biopsy, including adequate risk assessment, tailored careful observation after PRB. And medical staff should pay more attention to fluid management after ultrasound-guided PRB.",kidney disease

Tanshinone IIA is superior to paricalcitol in ameliorating tubulointerstitial fibrosis through regulation of VDR/Wnt/β-catenin pathway in rats with diabetic nephropathy.,"['Jing-YiZeng', 'YuWang', 'Fu-YuanHong', 'MiaoMiao', 'Yu-YingJiang', 'Zi-XuanQiao', 'Yun-TaoWang', 'Xiao-RongBao']","Glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis (TIF) are closely involved in the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Moreover, the development of TIF is closely related to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Tanshinone IIA (Tan) has various pharmacological effects, especially the anti-fibrotic effect. And it is mainly used in the clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Currently, the protective effect of Tan on DN and its possible mechanism have not been clearly elucidated. Our previous studies illustrated that Tan could improve the EMT of HK-2 cells induced by high glucose by regulating the vitamin D receptor (VDR)/Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Here, we collected demographic information and laboratory results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database in order to investigate the relationship between VD and DN. Then, we established a DN model and treated DN rats with Tan and paricalcitol (Par) for 6 weeks. We subsequently compared the changes in general condition, renal function, pathological changes, and TIF-related protein expression levels of control rats, DN rats induced by STZ, DN rats with Tan at 5.4 mg/kg, DN rats with Tan at 10.8 mg/kg, and DN rats with Par at 0.054 µg/kg, to explore the effect and mechanism of Tan and Par on DN rats. The results showed that VD had a protective effect against DN in diabetic patients. And we found that Tan had a protective effect on renal fibrosis in DN rats, which was superior to Par in improving the symptoms of ""three more and one less,"" reducing fasting blood glucose level, improving renal index, BUN/SCr, and UACR, reducing histopathological damage of kidney, and improving the expression of fibrosis-related proteins in kidney tissue by regulating VDR/Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Determination of age-specific reference intervals for selected serum and urinary biomarkers in elderly cats.,"['FemkeMortier', 'Robbyvan Leeuwenberg', 'SylvieDaminet', 'DominiquePaepe']","Annual health screening is recommended in elderly cats to allow the early detection of conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hyperthyroidism. Nevertheless, age-specific reference intervals (RIs) for renal and thyroid parameters in this population are lacking. The aim of this study was to determine age-specific RIs for selected serum and urine biomarkers related to CKD and hyperthyroidism, namely serum creatinine (sCr), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), phosphate (P), total calcium (tCa), total thyroxine (TT4), urinary protein:creatinine ratio (UPC) and urine specific gravity (USG). These RIs were established for elderly cats (aged ⩾7 years) in general, as well as for mature adult cats (aged 7-10 years) and senior cats (aged >10 years) separately.
A prospective study was conducted on client-owned cats aged ⩾7 years and considered healthy by their owners. The cats were screened to rule out metabolic and systemic diseases by means of a thorough history, complete physical examination, blood examination and urinalysis. The data from 206 healthy elderly cats (134 mature adult and 72 senior cats) were included. Age-appropriate RIs were determined following the guidelines of the American Society of Veterinary Clinical Pathology and compared with existing laboratory RIs.
Clinically relevant differences between the age-specific RI and the laboratory RI were found for several variables. Compared with the laboratory RI, the upper limit of the RI for cats aged ⩾7 years was lower for sCr, TT4 and P, and higher for SDMA. The lower limit of the age-appropriate RI was lower for USG. The new RI was almost identical to the existing laboratory RI for tCa and UPC.
Using age-specific RIs for renal and thyroid biomarkers in mature adult and senior cats has important clinical consequences for the interpretation of health screening results in elderly cats. This confirms the need to adapt laboratory RIs to the specific animal population for which the RI will be used.",kidney disease

Despite these concerns, limited hospital-based and comprehensive pediatric data have been published on MIS-C in Brazilian children.
We performed a descriptive analysis of the MIS-C scores in 16 public and private hospitals providing secondary and tertiary care in the metropolitan area of São Paulo, Brazil. Clinical and demographic information were systematically extracted from the electronic medical records of each patient. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the combined effects of MIS-C phenotype, disease severity and comorbidity as dependent variables.
A total of 101 patients met the MIS-C criteria and were evaluated. The median age was 67 months, 60% were male, 28.7% were black or afrodescendant and 62.3% were admitted to public hospitals. Underlying medical conditions were observed in 16.8% of patients and were associated with a longer duration of hospitalization. A Kawasaki disease-like phenotype was observed in 43.5% of patients, and they demonstrated a trend of lower median age. Children with severe MIS-C were older (median age 91 months vs. 36 months) and had a nonspecific phenotype, more cardiovascular and respiratory involvement and kidney injury; 73.3% required intensive care, 20.8% required mechanical ventilation and 35.6% required inotropic support. Four deaths occurred (CFR = 3.9%), three of which were in healthy participants.

"Probing Renal Microstructure and Function with Advanced Diffusion MRI: Concepts, Applications, Challenges, and Future Directions.","['JuliaStabinska', 'Hans-JörgWittsack', 'Lilach OLerman', 'AlexandraLjimani', 'Eric ESigmund']","Diffusion measurements in the kidney are affected not only by renal microstructure but also by physiological processes (i.e., glomerular filtration, water reabsorption, and urine formation). Because of the superposition of passive tissue diffusion, blood perfusion, and tubular pre-urine flow, the limitations of the monoexponential apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) model in assessing pathophysiological changes in renal tissue are becoming apparent and motivate the development of more advanced diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) variants. These approaches take advantage of the fact that the length scale probed in DWI measurements can be adjusted by experimental parameters, including diffusion-weighting, diffusion gradient directions and diffusion time. This forms the basis by which advanced DWI models can be used to capture not only passive diffusion effects, but also microcirculation, compartmentalization, tissue anisotropy. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in the field of renal DWI. Following a short introduction on renal structure and physiology, we present the key methodological approaches for the acquisition and analysis of renal DWI data, including intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), non-Gaussian diffusion, and hybrid IVIM-DTI. We then briefly summarize the applications of these methods in chronic kidney disease and renal allograft dysfunction.

Donor-derived endemic mycoses after solid organ transplantation: A review of reported cases.,"['Cybele Lara RAbad', 'Raymund RRazonable']","Donor-derived endemic mycoses are infrequently reported. We summarized the clinical characteristics and outcomes of these infections to provide guidance to transplant clinicians.
Multiple databases were reviewed from inception through May 31, 2023 using endemic fungi as key words (e.g., Coccidioides, histoplasma, blastomyces, talaromyces, paracoccidioides). Only donor-derived infections (DDI) were included.
Twenty-four cases of DDI were identified from 18 published reports; these included 16 coccidioidomycosis, seven histoplasmosis, and one talaromycosis. No cases of blastomycosis and paracoccidiodomycosis were published. The majority were male (17/24,70.8%). Half of the cases were probable (12/24, 50%), seven were possible (29.2%), and only five were proven DDI (20.8%). Donor-derived coccidioidomycosis were observed in kidney (n = 11), lung (n = 6), liver (n = 3), heart (n = 2) and combined SOT recipients (1 KP, 1 KL) at a median time of .9 (range .2-35) months after transplantation. For histoplasmosis, the majority were kidney recipients (6 of 7 cases) at a median onset of 8 (range .4-48) months after transplantation. The single reported possible donor-derived talaromycosis occurred in a man whose organ donor had at-risk travel to Southeast Asia. Collectively, the majority of donors had high-risk exposure to Coccidioides (9/11) or Histoplasma sp. (6/6). Most donor-derived endemic mycoses were disseminated (18/24, 75%), and mortality was reported in almost half of recipients (11/24, 45.8%).
Donor-derived endemic mycoses are often disseminated and are associated with high mortality. A detailed evaluation of donors for the potential of an undiagnosed fungal infection prior to organ donation is essential to mitigate the risk of these devastating infections.",kidney disease
Association of handgrip strength and walking pace with incident Parkinson's disease.,"['MengyiLiu', 'PanpanHe', 'ZiliangYe', 'YuanyuanZhang', 'ChunZhou', 'SisiYang', 'YanjunZhang', 'XianhuiQin']","We aimed to quantify the association of handgrip strength and self-reported walking pace with incident Parkinson's disease (PD) in the general population.
A total of 419 572 participants (54.1% females, mean age: 56.1 years [SD, 8.2]) without prior PD were included from UK Biobank. Handgrip strength was assessed by dynamometer. Walking pace was self-reported as slow, average or brisk. The study outcome was incident PD, determined by self-report data, hospital admission records or death records.
The mean handgrip strength was 23.5 (SD, 6.3) and 39.6 (SD, 8.9) kg for females and males, respectively. A total of 33 645 (8.0%), 221 682 (52.8%) and 164 245 (39.2%) participants reported slow, average and brisk walking pace, respectively. Over a median follow-up duration of 12.5 years, 2152 participants developed incident PD. When handgrip strength was assessed as sex-specific tertiles, compared with those in the third tertile, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) (95% confidence interval [CI]) of incident PD for participants in the second and first tertiles were 1.23 (1.09-1.39) and 1.60 (1.42-1.79), respectively. Compared with brisk walking pace, average (HR, 1.33; 95% CI: 1.20-1.47) or slow (HR, 1.84; 95% CI: 1.57-2.15) walking pace was associated with a higher risk of incident PD. A lower grip strength (Tertiles 1 and 2) and an average/slow walking pace accounted for 23.8% and 19.9% of PD cases, respectively. When handgrip strength and walking pace were considered together, the highest risk of incident PD was observed in participants with both lowest handgrip strength and slow walking pace (HR, 2.89; 95% CI: 2.30-3.64). Genetic risks of PD did not significantly modify the relation of handgrip strength (P for interaction = 0.371) or walking pace (P for interaction = 0.082) with new-onset PD.
Low handgrip strength and slow walking pace were significantly associated with a higher risk of incident PD, regardless of the individuals' genetic risk profile.",kidney disease
Comparison of Metabolic Effects of Three Different Treatment Combinations with Retrospective Real-life Data in People Living with HIV.,"['AdemSimsek', 'OguzKarabay', 'ErtugrulGuclu', 'HandeToptan']","Comorbidities are increasing in people living with HIV (PLHIV), and different treatment options have advantages and disadvantages. It is important to compare information from real-life treated cases. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the data on efficacy and clinical and laboratory findings during different antiretroviral therapies.
Retrospective file data of 47 PLHIV using Dolutegravir and Lamivudine (3TC/DTG), Tenofovir Alafenamide Emtricitabine and Elvitegravir Cobicistat (EVG/c/TAF/FTC) and Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate and Emtricitabine and Efavirenz (EFV/FTC/TDF) were analyzed. Data of the patients at baseline and 12 months after antiretroviral therapy (ART) were compared.
About 47 PLHIV were included in the study. Of the patients, 22 (46.8%) were in the 3TC/DTG group, 19 (40.4%) in the EVG/c/TAF/FTC, and 6 (12.8%) in the EFV/FTC/TDF group. After 12 months of treatment, BMI, HIV-RNA, CD4, WBC, hemoglobin, MCV, PDW, RDW, platelet count, creatinine, eGFR, HDL, AST, glucose values of the 3TC/DTG group were significantly different (p<0.05). After 12 months of treatment, BMI, HIV-RNA, CD4 count, MCV, creatinine, eGFR, HDL, LDL, TG, TC, AST, and HOMA-IR values of the EVG/c/TAF/FTC treatment group were significantly different (p<0.05). After 12 months of treatment, HIV RNA, total bilirubin, and LDL values in the EFV/FTC/TDF treatment group were statistically different (p<0.05).
All treatment groups showed a decrease in HIV-RNA and an increase in CD4 at the end of one year. While CD4 elevation is lower in EFV recipients than in integrase inhibitor (INSTI) recipients, weight gain is higher in INSTI recipients.

Crosslinking strategies of decellularized extracellular matrix in tissue regeneration.,"['SuQiao', 'TanPeijie', 'JiangNan']","By removing the immunogenic cellular components through various decellularization methods, decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) is considered a promising material in the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine with highly preserved physicochemical properties and superior biocompatibility. However, decellularization treatment can lead to some loss of structural integrity, mechanical strength, degradation stability, and biological performance of dECM biomaterials. Therefore, physical and chemical crosslinking methods are preferred to restore or even improve the biomechanical properties, stability, and bioactivity, and to achieve a delicate balance between degradation of the implanted biomaterial and regeneration of the host tissue. This review provides an overview of dECM biomaterials, and describes and compares the mechanisms and characteristics of commonly used crosslinking methods for dECM, with a focus on the potential applications of versatile dECM-based biomaterials derived from skin, cardiac tissues (pericardium, heart valves, myocardial tissue), blood vessels, liver, and kidney, modified with different chemical crosslinking reagents, in tissue and organ regeneration.",kidney disease
Sexual Function in Renal Transplant Recipients with Internal versus External Iliac Artery Anastomosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"['AmirJavid', 'NarjesSaberi', 'AmirBehnamfar', 'HosnaGharzi', 'FarshadGholipour', 'HossienBahrami']","The choice between using the internal or external iliac arteries to supply a transplanted kidney poses is a dilemma during renal transplantation. As the internal iliac artery branches to the genital tract, cutting it could potentially result in sexual dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of these two surgical methods on sexual function.
122 sexually active male patients under the age of sixty were randomly divided into two groups: the internal iliac anastomosis group and the external iliac artery anastomosis group. Before surgery and one year after the procedure, patients completed the International Index of Erectile Function-15 questionnaire (IIEF-15), and the difference in scores of each domain was measured.
Statistically, kidney transplantation  improved all domains of IIEF in both groups, except for the erectile function in for patients who underwent  internal iliac artery anastomosis group. Additionally, Also, there were significant differences between  the two groups in the domains of erectile function (p-value=0.04) and overall satisfaction (p-value= 0.002), while other domains such as orgasmic function, sexual desire, and intercourse satisfaction did not show any statistically significant differences.
In conclusion, the choice between using the internal or external iliac artery for arterial anastomosis during kidney transplantation does not significantly impact graft function. However, it may negatively affect erectile function in patients who undergo internal iliac artery anastomosis.",kidney disease

"Obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiometabolic risk: An Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) 2023.","['Harold EdwardBays', 'ShagunBindlish', 'Tiffany LoweClayton']","This Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) Clinical Practice Statement (CPS) is intended to provide clinicians an overview of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), an obesity-related cardiometabolic risk factor.
The scientific support for this CPS is based upon published citations and clinical perspectives of OMA authors.
Topics include T2DM and obesity as cardiometabolic risk factors, definitions of obesity and adiposopathy, and mechanisms for how obesity causes insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Adipose tissue is an active immune and endocrine organ, whose adiposopathic obesity-mediated dysfunction contributes to metabolic abnormalities often encountered in clinical practice, including hyperglycemia (e.g., pre-diabetes mellitus and T2DM). The determination as to whether adiposopathy ultimately leads to clinical metabolic disease depends on crosstalk interactions and biometabolic responses of non-adipose tissue organs such as liver, muscle, pancreas, kidney, and brain.
This review is intended to assist clinicians in the care of patients with the disease of obesity and T2DM. This CPS provides a simplified overview of how obesity may cause insulin resistance, pre-diabetes, and T2DM. It also provides an algorithmic approach towards treatment of a patient with obesity and T2DM, with ""treat obesity first"" as a priority. Finally, treatment of obesity and T2DM might best focus upon therapies that not only improve the weight of patients, but also improve the health outcomes of patients (e.g., cardiovascular disease and cancer).",kidney disease

QuantiFERON-CMV as a Predictor of CMV Events During Preemptive Therapy in CMV-seropositive Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"['José OReusing', 'FabianaAgena', 'Camille NKotton', 'GustavoCampana', 'Ligia CameraPierrotti', 'EliasDavid-Neto']","Prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection after kidney transplantation is costly and burdensome.
Given its promising utility in risk stratification, we evaluated the use of QuantiFERON-CMV (QFCMV) and additional clinical variables in this prospective cohort study to predict the first clinically significant CMV infection (CS-CMV, ranging from asymptomatic viremia requiring treatment to CMV disease) in the first posttransplant year. A cost-effectiveness analysis for guided prevention was done.
One hundred adult kidney transplant recipients, CMV IgG+, were given basiliximab induction and maintained on steroid/mycophenolate/tacrolimus with weekly CMV monitoring. Thirty-nine patients developed CS-CMV infection (viral syndrome, n = 1; end-organ disease, n = 9; and asymptomatic viremia, n = 29). A nonreactive or indeterminate QFCMV result using the standard threshold around day 30 (but not before transplant) was associated with CS-CMV rates of 50% and 75%, respectively. A higher QFCMV threshold for reactivity (>1.0 IU interferon-γ/mL) outperformed the manufacturer's standard (>0.2 IU interferon-γ/mL) in predicting protection but still allowed a 16% incidence of CS-CMV. The combination of recipient age and type of donor, along with posttransplant QFCMV resulted in a prediction model that increased the negative predictive value from 84% (QFCMV alone) to 93%. QFCMV-guided preemptive therapy was of lower cost than preemptive therapy alone (P < 0.001, probabilistic sensitivity analysis) and was cost-effective (incremental net monetary benefit of 210 USD) assuming willingness-to-pay of 2000 USD to avoid 1 CMV disease.
Guided CMV prevention by the prediction model with QFCMV is cost-effective and would spare from CMV surveillance in 42% of patients with low risk for CS-CMV.",kidney disease

Economic burden of in-hospital AKI: a one-year analysis of the nationwide French hospital discharge database.,"['CélineMonard', 'ThomasRimmelé', 'EstherBlanc', 'MélanieGoguillot', 'StèveBénard', 'JulienTextoris']","Although Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) incidence is increasing worldwide, data investigating its cost are lacking. This population-wide study aimed to describe the characteristics and costs of hospital stays with, and without AKI, and to estimate the AKI-associated increases in costs and length of stay (LOS) in three subgroups (major open visceral surgery (MOV), cardiovascular surgery with extracorporeal circulation (CVEC), and sepsis).
All hospital stays that occurred in France in 2018 were included. Stay and patient characteristics were collected in the French hospital discharge database and described. Medical conditions were identified using the 10
26,917,832 hospital stays, of which 415,067 (1.5%) with AKI, were included. AKI was associated with 83,553 (19.8%), 7,165 (17.9%), and 15,387 (9.2%) of the stays with sepsis, CVEC, and MOV, respectively. Compared to stays without AKI, stays with AKI were more expensive (median [IQR] €4,719[€2,963-€7782] vs. €735[€383-€1,805]) and longer (median [IQR] 9[4-16] vs. 0[0-2] days).

Patients with a history of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may have tumor deposits to the thyroid gland preceding or following their initial cancer diagnosis for many years. The diagnosis can be challenging, and clinicians must remain suspicious of a newly found thyroid nodule in a patient with a history of RCC. In this review, we report a case of a patient with RCC who was incidentally found to have a thyroid nodule on surveillance imaging found to be consistent with tumor-to-tumor metastasis from RCC into papillary thyroid carcinoma. It is imperative to consider this diagnosis as the thyroid is the most common site of spread, and treatment with partial or total thyroidectomy has led to improved survival.",kidney disease

Therefore, in this study we aimed at both validating NLR as a predictor of death in older hospitalized patients and assess whether the presence of specific acute diseases can modify its predictive value.
This prospective cohort study included 5034 hospitalizations of older patients admitted to acute care units in the context of the ReportAge study. NLR measured at admission was considered as the exposure variable, while in-hospital mortality was the outcome of the study. ROC curves with Youden's method and restricted cubic splines were used to identify the optimal NLR cut-off of increased risk. Cox proportional hazard models, stratified analyses, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to analyse the association between NLR and in-hospital mortality.
Both continuous and categorical NLR value (cut-off ≥ 7.95) predicted mortality in bivariate and multivariate prognostic models with a good predictive accuracy. The magnitude of this association was even higher in patients without sepsis, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia, and those with higher eGFR, albumin, and hemoglobin (p < 0.001). A negative multiplicative interaction was found between NLR and eGFR < 45 (p = 0.001).
NLR at admission is a readily available and cost-effective biomarker that could improve identification of geriatric patients at high risk of death during hospital stay independent of admitting diagnosis, kidney function and hemoglobin levels.",kidney disease

Successful management of concurrent COVID-19 and Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients: a case series.,"['GuopingLi', 'DaxiJi', 'YouchengChang', 'ZhengTang', 'DongruiCheng']","Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening pulmonary fungal infection that predominantly affects immunocompromised individuals, including kidney transplant recipients. Recent years have witnessed a rising incidence of PCP in this vulnerable population, leading to graft loss and increased mortality. Immunosuppression, which is essential in transplant recipients, heightens susceptibility to viral and opportunistic infections, magnifying the clinical challenge. Concurrently, the global impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been profound. Kidney transplant recipients have faced severe outcomes when infected with SARS-CoV-2, often requiring intensive care. Co-infection with COVID-19 and PCP in this context represents a complex clinical scenario that requires precise management strategies, involving a delicate balance between immunosuppression and immune activation. Although there have been case reports on management of COVID-19 and PCP in kidney transplant recipients, guidance on how to tackle these infections when they occur concurrently remains limited.
We have encountered four kidney transplant recipients with concurrent COVID-19 and PCP infection. These patients received comprehensive treatment that included adjustment of their maintenance immunosuppressive regimen, anti-pneumocystis therapy, treatment for COVID-19 and other infections, and symptomatic and supportive care. After this multifaceted treatment strategy, all of these patients improved significantly and had favorable outcomes.
We have successfully managed four kidney transplant recipients co-infected with COVID-19 and PCP. While PCP is a known complication of immunosuppressive therapy, its incidence in patients with COVID-19 highlights the complexity of dual infections. Our findings suggest that tailored immunosuppressive regimens, coupled with antiviral and antimicrobial therapies, can lead to clinical improvement in such cases. Further research is needed to refine risk assessment and therapeutic strategies, which will ultimately enhance the care of this vulnerable population.",kidney disease

These mutations result in plasma and lysosome accumulation of glycosphingolipids, leading to progressive organ damage and reduced life expectancy. Due to the availability of specific disease-modifying treatments, proper and timely diagnosis and therapy are essential to prevent irreversible complications. However, diagnosis of FD is often delayed because of the wide clinical heterogeneity of the disease and multiple organ involvement developing in variable temporal sequences. This observation is also valid for renal involvement, which may manifest with non-specific signs, such as proteinuria and chronic kidney disease, which are also common in many other nephropathies. Moreover, an additional confounding factor is the possibility of the coexistence of FD with other kidney disorders. Thus, suspecting and diagnosing FD nephropathy in patients with signs of kidney disease may be challenging for the clinical nephrologist. Herein, also through the presentation of a unique case of co-occurrence of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and FD, we review the available literature on cases of coexistence of FD and other renal diseases and discuss the implications of these conditions. Moreover, we highlight the clinical, laboratory, and histological elements that may suggest clinical suspicion and address a proper diagnosis of Fabry nephropathy.",kidney disease
Metabolome panels as potential noninvasive biomarkers for primary glomerulonephritis sub-types: meta-analysis of profiling metabolomics studies.,"['AmirRoointan', 'MaryamGhaeidamini', 'SabaShafieizadegan', 'Kelly LHudkins', 'AliehGholaminejad']","Primary glomerulonephritis diseases (PGDs) are known as the top causes of chronic kidney disease worldwide. Renal biopsy, an invasive method, is the main approach to diagnose PGDs. Studying the metabolome profiles of kidney diseases is an inclusive approach to identify the disease's underlying pathways and discover novel non-invasive biomarkers. So far, different experiments have explored the metabolome profiles in different PGDs, but the inconsistencies might hinder their clinical translations. The main goal of this meta-analysis study was to achieve consensus panels of dysregulated metabolites in PGD sub-types. The PGDs-related metabolome profiles from urine samples in humans were selected in a comprehensive search. Amanida package in R software was utilized for performing the meta-analysis. Through sub-type analyses, the consensus list of metabolites in each category was obtained. To identify the most affected pathways, functional enrichment analysis was performed. Also, a gene-metabolite network was constructed to identify the key metabolites and their connected proteins. After a vigorous search, among the 11 selected studies (15 metabolite profiles), 270 dysregulated metabolites were recognized in urine of 1154 PGDs and control samples. Through sub-type analyses by Amanida package, the consensus list of metabolites in each category was obtained. Top dysregulated metabolites (vote score of ≥ 4 or ≤ - 4) in PGDs urines were selected as main panel of meta-metabolites including glucose, leucine, choline, betaine, dimethylamine, fumaric acid, citric acid, 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, pyruvic acid, isobutyric acid, and hippuric acid. The enrichment analyses results revealed the involvement of different biological pathways such as the TCA cycle and amino acid metabolisms in the pathogenesis of PGDs. The constructed metabolite-gene interaction network revealed the high centralities of several metabolites, including pyruvic acid, leucine, and choline. The identified metabolite panels could shed a light on the underlying pathological pathways and be considered as non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of PGD sub-types.",kidney disease
Continuous glucose monitoring in people with diabetes and end-stage kidney disease-review of association studies and Evidence-Based discussion.,"['ZuzannaJakubowska', 'JolantaMalyszko']","Diabetic nephropathy is currently the leading cause of end-stage kidney disease. The present methods of assessing diabetes control, such as glycated hemoglobin or self-monitoring of blood glucose, have limitations. Over the past decade, the field of continuous glucose monitoring has been greatly improved and expanded. This review examines the use of continuous glucose monitoring in people with end-stage kidney disease treated with hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD), or kidney transplantation. We assessed the use of both real-time continuous glucose monitoring and flash glucose monitoring technology in terms of hypoglycemia detection, glycemic variability, and efficacy, defined as an improvement in clinical outcomes and diabetes control. Overall, the use of continuous glucose monitoring in individuals with end-stage kidney disease may improve glycemic control and detection of hypoglycemia. However, most of the published studies were observational with no control group. Moreover, not all studies used the same assessment parameters. There are very few studies involving subjects on peritoneal dialysis. The small number of studies with limited numbers of participants, short follow-up period, and small number of manufacturers of continuous glucose monitoring systems are limitations of the review.

Monogenic and polygenic concepts in chronic kidney disease (CKD).,"['JuliaJefferis', 'RebeccaHudson', 'PaulLacaze', 'AndrewBakshi', 'CarmelHawley', 'ChiragPatel', 'AndrewMallett']","Kidney function is strongly influenced by genetic factors with both monogenic and polygenic factors contributing to kidney function. Monogenic disorders with primarily autosomal dominant inheritance patterns account for 10% of adult and 50% of paediatric kidney diseases. However, kidney function is also a complex trait with polygenic architecture, where genetic factors interact with environment and lifestyle factors. Family studies suggest that kidney function has significant heritability at 35-69%, capturing complexities of the genome with shared environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies estimate the single nucleotide polymorphism-based heritability of kidney function between 7.1 and 20.3%. These heritability estimates, measuring the extent to which genetic variation contributes to CKD risk, indicate a strong genetic contribution. Polygenic Risk Scores have recently been developed for chronic kidney disease and kidney function, and validated in large populations. Polygenic Risk Scores show correlation with kidney function but lack the specificity to predict individual-level changes in kidney function. Certain kidney diseases, such as membranous nephropathy and IgA nephropathy that have significant genetic components, may benefit most from polygenic risk scores for improved risk stratification. Genetic studies of kidney function also provide a potential avenue for the development of more targeted therapies and interventions. Understanding the development and validation of genomic scores is required to guide their implementation and identify the most appropriate potential implications in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an overview of the heritability of kidney function traits in population studies, explore both monogenic and polygenic concepts in kidney disease, with a focus on recently developed polygenic risk scores in kidney function and chronic kidney disease, and review specific diseases which are most amenable to incorporation of genomic scores.",kidney disease

However, the association between chronic kidney disease and insulin resistance in detailed hypertension pattern groups such as isolated diastolic hypertension remains unclear. Triglyceride-glucose index has been noted as an indicator of insulin resistance. This study investigated the association between the triglyceride-glucose index and chronic kidney disease in four blood pressure groups: isolated diastolic hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, systolic diastolic hypertension, and normotension. Using a database of 41,811 middle-aged men who had two or more annual health checkups from 2007 to 2019, those with chronic kidney disease at the first visit, antihypertensive/diabetes/dyslipidemia medication users, and incomplete data were excluded. Four groups were categorized using the 140/90 mmHg threshold. A COX proportional hazards model was used to assess the triglyceride-glucose index with incident chronic kidney disease. Participants were divided: isolated diastolic hypertension: 2207 (6.72%), isolated systolic hypertension: 2316 (7.06%), systolic-diastolic hypertension: 3299 (10.05%), normal: 24,996 (76.17%).

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of moderate CKD on anxiety in rats. 5/6 nephrectomy was performed in male Wistar rats. 7 weeks after, anxiety-like behavior was assessed by elevated plus maze (EPM), open field (OF), and marble burying (MB) tests. At weeks 8 and 9, urinalysis was performed, and blood and amygdala samples were collected, respectively. In the amygdala, the gene expression of Avp and the gene and protein expression of Crh, Crhr1, and Crhr2 were analyzed. Furthermore, the plasma concentration of corticosterone, uremic toxins, and tryptophan metabolites was measured by UHPLC-MS/MS. Laboratory tests confirmed the development of CKD. In the CKD group, the closed arm time increased; the central time and the total number of entries decreased in the EPM. There was a reduction in rearing, central distance and time in the OF, and fewer interactions with marbles were detected during MB. CKD evoked an upregulation of gene expression of Crh, Crhr1, and Crhr2, but not Avp, in the amygdala. However, there was no alteration in protein expression. In the CKD group, plasma concentrations of p-cresyl-sulfate, indoxyl-sulfate, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, anthranilic acid, xanthurenic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, picolinic acid, and quinolinic acid increased. However, the levels of tryptophan, tryptamine, 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, and tyrosine decreased. In conclusion, moderate CKD evoked anxiety-like behavior that might be mediated by the accumulation of uremic toxins and metabolites of the kynurenine pathway, but the contribution of the amygdalar CRH system to the development of anxiety seems to be negligible at this stage.",kidney disease

SET domain-containing 2 (SETD2) has been identified as an important tumor suppressor and an immunosuppressor in ccRCC. However, the role of SETD2 in ccRCC generation in PKD remains largely unexplored. Herein, we perform metabolomics, lipidomics, transcriptomics and proteomics within SETD2 loss induced PKD-ccRCC transition mouse model. Our analyses show that SETD2 loss causes extensive metabolic reprogramming events that eventually results in enhanced sphingomyelin biosynthesis and tumorigenesis. Clinical ccRCC patient specimens further confirm the abnormal metabolic reprogramming and sphingomyelin accumulation. Tumor symptom caused by Setd2 knockout is relieved by myriocin, a selective inhibitor of serine-palmitoyl-transferase and sphingomyelin biosynthesis.

A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphatic metastasis of BC may yield potential targets for its treatment. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on epigenetic factors-including miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs-associated with lymphatic metastasis in BC. These factors are strongly associated with lymphangiogenesis, cancer cell proliferation and migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition processes, providing new insights to develop newer BC treatment strategies.",kidney disease

The morphologic factor sonic hedgehog (SHH) plays an important role in a variety of vascular diseases, so it may be directly or indirectly involved in the process of renal arteriolar disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between serum SHH levels and renal arteriole disease in patients with IgAN.
Subjects with primary IgAN diagnosed by renal biopsy performed between October 2018 and August 2019 at the First Medical Center of the Chinese PLA General Hospital were recruited. Blood specimens were collected from the patients within 1 week before renal biopsy after they signed an informed consent form, and healthy controls were recruited for blood specimen collection during the same period. The concentration of serum SHH was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in this population.
Serum SHH levels were significantly lower in the IgAN group than in the control group. 41 of the 94 subjects diagnosed with IgAN had severe renal arteriolosclerosis and, compared to their less severely affected counterparts, were older, more hypertensive, and characterized by lower levels of SHH, higher levels of tubular atrophy/interstitial fibrosis and a higher Lee's classification. Serum SHH concentration was found to be an independent predictor of severe intrarenal arteriolosclerosis in IgAN subjects after correction using multivariate analysis.
In this study, serum SHH levels were found to be significantly lower in patients with IgAN than in healthy subjects. Serum SHH may serve as a noninvasive biomarker of intrarenal arteriolosclerosis in patients with IgAN.",kidney disease
A sensitive luciferase reporter assay for the detection of infectious African swine fever virus.,"['KemalMehinagic', 'MatthiasLiniger', 'MaksymSamoilenko', 'NickSoltermann', 'MarkusGerber', 'NicolasRuggli']","African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a complex DNA virus causing severe hemorrhagic disease in domestic pigs and wild boar. The disease has spread worldwide, with important socio-economic consequences. Early virus detection and control measures are crucial as there are no effective vaccines nor antivirals on the market. While the diagnosis of ASFV is fast and based primarily on qPCR, the detection of infectious ASFV is a labor-intensive process requiring susceptible macrophages and subsequent antibody-based staining or hemadsorption. The latter cannot detect ASFV isolates devoid of functional CD2v (EP402R) expression. Here, we report the development of a plasmid-based reporter assay (RA) for the sensitive detection and titration of infectious ASFV. To this end, we constructed a plasmid for secreted NanoLuc luciferase (secNluc) expression driven by the ASFV DNA polymerase gene G1211R promoter. Infection of plasmid-transfected immortalized porcine kidney macrophages (IPKM) followed by measurement of secNluc from cell culture supernatants allowed reliable automated quantification of infectious ASFV. The RA-based titers matched the titers determined by conventional p72-staining or hemadsorption protocols. The novel assay is specific for ASFV as it does not detect classical swine fever virus nor porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. It is applicable to ASFV of different genotypes, virulence, and sources, including ASFV from sera and whole blood from infected pigs as well as non-hemadsorbing ASFV.",kidney disease

We found that α-MG could alleviate tubule-interstitial damage and decrease fibrotic (α-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA], fibronectin, and collagen I), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) protein (N-cadherin, Snail, Slug, TGF-β1 and vimentin) expression in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice with chronic kidney disease. α-MG significantly decreased motility as well as inhibited expression of fibrotic- and EMT-related proteins in TGF-β1-induced HK2 cells. To clarify the molecular mechanisms of α-MG in reducing renal interstitial fibrosis, we used a MEK inhibitor (U0126) or Smad inhibitor (SB431542) cotreatment with α-MG. This is the first study is to demonstrate the antifibrotic effects of α-MG by targeting the TGF-β1/ERK/Smad-mediated EMT signaling pathway, is even more effective against renal interstitial fibrosis.",kidney disease
Systemic biomarkers of microvascular alterations in type 1 diabetes associated neuropathy and nephropathy - A prospective long-term follow-up study.,"['EvangeliaBaldimtsi', 'Per AWhiss', 'JeanetteWahlberg']","This study aimed to investigate circulating biomarkers associated with the risk of developing diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and nephropathy in type 1 diabetes (T1D).
Patients with childhood-onset T1D (n = 49, age 38.3 ± 3.8 yrs.) followed prospectively were evaluated after 30 years of diabetes duration. DPN was defined as an abnormality in nerve conduction tests. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and its tissue inhibitor TIMP-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin-2 (NGAL), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), estimated GFR (eGFR), micro/macroalbuminuria and routine biochemistry were assessed. For comparison, control subjects were included (n = 30, age 37.9 ± 5.5 yrs.).
In all, twenty-five patients (51 %) were diagnosed with DPN, and nine patients (18 %) had nephropathy (five microalbuminuria and four macroalbuminuria). Patients with DPN had higher levels of TIMP-1 (p = 0.036) and sP-selectin (p = 0.005) than controls. Patients with DPN also displayed higher levels of TIMP-1 compared to patients without DPN (p = 0.035). Patients with macroalbuminuria had kidney disease stage 3 with lower eGFR, higher levels of TIMP-1 (p = 0.038), and NGAL (p = 0.002). In all patients, we found only weak negative correlations between eGFR and TIMP-1 (rho = -0.304, p = 0.040) and NGAL (rho = -0.277, p = 0.062, ns), respectively. MMP-9 was higher in patients with microalbuminuria (p = 0.021) compared with normoalbuminuric patients.
Our findings indicate that TIMP-1 and MMP-9, as well as sP-selectin and NGAL, are involved in microvascular complications in T1D. Monitoring and targeting these biomarkers may be a potential strategy for treating diabetic nephropathy and neuropathy.",kidney disease
Meta-GWAS on PCSK9 concentrations reveals associations of novel loci outside the PCSK9 locus in White populations.,"['AzinKheirkhah', 'Johanna FranziskaSchachtl-Riess', 'ClaudiaLamina', 'SilviaDi Maio', 'AdrianaKoller', 'SebastianSchönherr', 'StefanCoassin', 'LukasForer', 'PeggySekula', 'ChristianGieger', 'AnnettePeters', 'AnnaKöttgen', 'Kai-UweEckardt', 'FlorianKronenberg']","Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key regulator of lipid homeostasis. A few earlier genome-wide association studies (GWAS) investigated genetic variants associated with circulating PCSK9 concentrations. However, uncertainty remains about some of the genetic loci discovered beyond the PCSK9 locus. By conducting the largest PCSK9 meta-analysis of GWAS (meta-GWAS) so far, we aimed to identify novel loci and validate the previously reported loci that regulate PCSK9 concentrations.
We performed GWAS for PCSK9 concentrations in two large cohorts (GCKD (n = 4,963) and KORA F3 (n = 2,895)). These were meta-analyzed with previously published data encompassing together 20,579 individuals. We further conducted a second meta-analysis in statin-naïve individuals (n = 15,390). A genetic risk score (GRS) was constructed on PCSK9-increasing SNPs and assessed its impact on the risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) in 394,943 statin-naïve participants (17,077 with events) of the UK Biobank by performing CAD-free survival analysis.
Nine loci were genome-wide significantly associated with PCSK9 concentrations. These included the previously described PCSK9, APOB, KCNA1/KCNA5, and TM6SF2/SUGP1 loci. All imputed SNPs in the PCSK9 locus account for ∼15% of variance of PCSK9 concentrations. We further identified FADS2 as a novel locus that was also found in statin-naïve participants. All imputed SNPs within the FADS2 locus explain ∼1.2% of variance of PCSK9 concentrations. Additionally, four further loci (a region on chromosome 5, SDK1, SPATA16 and HPR) were genome-wide significant in either the main model or the statin-naïve subset. The linear increase in a PCSK9 genetic risk score was associated with 1.41-fold (95%CI 1.16-1.72, p < 0.001) higher risk for incident CAD.
We identified five novel loci (FADS2, SPATA16, SDK1, HPR and a region on chromosome 5) for PCSK9 concentrations that would require further research. Additionally, we confirm the genome-wide significant loci that were previously detected.",kidney disease
Chemoradiotherapy treatment with gemcitabine improves renal function in locally advanced cervical cancer patients with renal dysfunction.,"['SilviaAlarcón-Barrios', 'JulissaLuvián-Morales', 'DenisseCastro-Eguiluz', 'MerariDelgadillo-González', 'Brenda OliviaLezcano-Velázquez', 'Eder AlexandroArango-Bravo', 'LauraFlores-Cisneros', 'SebastiánAguiar Rosas', 'LucelyCetina-Pérez']","Cervical cancer (CC) in Mexico is diagnosed mainly in locally advanced (LACC) and advanced (ACC) stages, where ureteral obstruction is more frequent. The standard treatment for this population is concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with cisplatin, which is nephrotoxic and could lead to further deterioration of renal function in LACC patients with renal function decline. We aimed to evaluate the effect of CCRT with Gemcitabine on renal function in LACC patients.
This retrospective study included LACC patients treated with CCRT with Gemcitabine as a radiosensitizer from February 2003 to December 2018. Data were collected from medical archives and electronic records. We assessed renal function before and after CCRT treatment and analyzed the patient's response to treatment and survival.
351 LACC patients treated were included and stratified into two groups: 198 with Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) ≥60ml/min (group A) and 153 with GFR<60ml/min (group B). An improvement in GFR was observed after CCRT in patients in group B, from 33 ml/min to 57.5 ml/min (p<0.001). Complete response was observed in 64.1% of patients in Group A and 43.8% in Group B (p<0.0001). Factors associated with increased risk of death included having a GFR of 15-29 ml/min (HR: 2.17; 1.08-4.35), having GFR<15 ml/min (HR: 3.08; 1.63-5.79), and receiving Boost treatment (HR: 2.09; 1.18-3.69). On the other hand, receiving brachytherapy is a positive predictor for OS (HR:0.51; 0.31-0.84).

We sought to examine the feasibility of using ""real-world"" office BP data obtained from electronic health records (EHR) to generate age-, sex- and height-specific BP percentiles for children.
Using data collected 01/01/2009-8/31/2021 from eight large children's healthcare organisations in PEDSnet, we applied a mixed-effects polynomial regression model with random slopes to generate Z-scores and BP percentiles and compared them with currently used normative BP distributions published in the 2017 American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) Clinical Practise Guidelines (CPG).
We identified a study sample of 292,412 children (1,085,083 BP measurements), ages 3-17 years (53% female), with no chronic medical conditions, who were not overweight/obese and who were primarily seen for general paediatric care in outpatient settings. Approximately 45,000-75,000 children contributed data to each age category. The PEDSnet systolic BP percentile values were 1-4 mmHg higher than AAP CPG BP values across age-sex-height groups, with larger differences observed in younger children. Diastolic BP values were also higher in younger children; starting with age 7 years, diastolic BP percentile values were 1-3 mmHg lower than AAP CPG values. Cohen's Kappa was 0.90 for systolic BP, 0.66 for diastolic BP, and 0.80 overall indicating excellent agreement between PEDSnet and 2017 AAP CPG data for systolic BP and substantial agreement for diastolic BP.
Our analysis indicates that real-word EHR data can be used to generate BP percentiles consistent with current clinical practise on BP management in children.

We aimed to inspect the pre-operative QoL among patients with craniopharyngioma and to explore the potential correlations between parameters of QoL and clinical indices.
We enrolled a total of 109 patients with craniopharyngioma. We utilized Short Form 36 (SF-36), Symptom Check List-90, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire scale (GAD7), Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ9) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to prospectively evaluated their QoL. Parameters of QoL along with clinical indices were compared among sub-groups divided according to Puget classification. Correlation analyses and regression analyses were performed to detect influential determinants to self-reported wellness.
Patients presented impaired QoL compared with general population (p < 0.001), as assessed by SF-36. Correlation analyses indicated the detrimental influence resulting from central diabetes insipidus (CDI). Multivariate linear regression unveiled the adverse effect of CDI on Mental Component Summary (coefficient = -13.869, p= 0.007), GAD7 total score (coefficient = 2.072, p = 0.049) as well as PHQ9 total score (coefficient = 3.721, p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression verified CDI as a risk factor of developing depressive symptoms (OR = 6.160, p = 0.001).
QoL of patients with craniopharyngioma was remarkably compromised before operation. CDI exerted detrimental influences on patients' QoL and it might serve as a marker for early identification of patients at risk of depression.",kidney disease

Pediatric patients with PPNAD typically have unusual skin lesions and slow growth with unknown causes. We present a case of a female Chinese patient with PPNAD caused by the germline PRKACA gene copy number gain of chromosome 19. The patient initially presented with kidney stones, short stature, and obesity. After further testing, it was discovered that the patient had diabetes, mild hypertension, low bone mass, a low ACTH level, and hypercortisolemia, and neither the low-dose or high-dose dexamethasone suppression test was able to inhibit hematuric cortisol, which paradoxically increased. PPNAD was pathologically diagnosed after unilateral adrenalectomy. Chromosome microarrays and whole exon sequencing analyses of the peripheral blood, as well as testing of sectioned adrenal tissue, showed a rise in the copy number of the duplication-containing PRKACA gene on chromosome 19p13.13p13.12, a de novo but not heritable gene defect that causes disease. The clinical signs and symptoms supported the diagnosis of Carney complex (CNC). One significant mechanism of CNC pathogenesis may be the rise in germline PRKACA copy number of chromosome 19. When assessing PPNAD patients for CNC, the possibility of PRKACA gene amplification should be considered. The effect of PRKACA gene amplification on the clinical manifestations of CNC needs to be confirmed by more cases.",kidney disease

These factors are known to play an important role in osteolysis as well as potential targets for the treatment of osteolysis. Sesamin has been shown to have a variety of biological functions, such as inhibiting inflammation, anti-tumour and involvement in the regulation of fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism. However, the therapeutic effect of sesamin on osteolysis and its mechanism remain unclear. Present studies shown that in the condition of in vitro, sesamin could inhibit osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, as well as suppressing the expression of osteoclast-specific genes. Further studies on the mechanism suggest that the effect of sesamin on human osteoclasts was mediated by blocking the ERK and NF-κB signalling pathways. Besides, sesamin was found to be effective in treating LPS-induced osteolysis by decreasing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Sesamin was non-toxic to heart, liver, kidney, lung and spleen. Therefore, sesamin is a promising phytochemical agent for the therapy of osteolysis-related diseases caused by inflammation and excessive osteoclast activation.",kidney disease

We describe the kinetics of immune activation following systemic AAV serotype 9 (AAV9) administration in 38 subjects following two distinct prophylactic immunomodulation regimens. Group 1 received corticosteroids and Group 2 received rituximab plus sirolimus in addition to steroids to prevent anti-AAV antibody formation.
Group 1 subjects had a rapid increase of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG). Increase in D-dimer, decline in platelet count and complement activation are indicative of TMA. All Group 1 subjects demonstrated activation of both classical and alternative complement pathways indicated by depletion of C4, elevated SC5b-9, Ba, and Bb antigens. Group 2 patients did not have a significant change in IgM or IgG and had minimal complement activation.
This study demonstrates that TMA in the setting of AAV gene therapy is antibody dependent (classical pathway) and amplified by the alternative complement pathway. Critical time points and interventions are identified to allow for management of immune mediated events which impact the safety and efficacy of systemic gene therapy.",kidney disease

Uremic cardiomyopathy is a common cardiovascular complication of CKD, characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), diastolic dysfunction, and fibrosis. Kisspeptins and their receptor, KISS1R, exert a pivotal influence on kidney pathophysiology and modulate age-related pathologies across various organ systems. KISS1R agonists, including kisspeptin-13 (KP-13), hold promise as novel therapeutic agents within age-related biological processes and kidney-related disorders. Our investigation aimed to elucidate the impact of KP-13 on the trajectory of CKD and uremic cardiomyopathy. Male Wistar rats (300-350 g) were randomized into four groups: (I) sham-operated, (II) 5/6 nephrectomy-induced CKD, (III) CKD subjected to a low dose of KP-13 (intraperitoneal 13 µg/day), and (IV) CKD treated with a higher KP-13 dose (intraperitoneal 26 µg/day). Treatments were administered daily from week 3 for 10 days. After 13 weeks, KP-13 increased systemic blood pressure, accentuating diastolic dysfunction's echocardiographic indicators and intensifying CKD-associated markers such as serum urea levels, glomerular hypertrophy, and tubular dilation. Notably, KP-13 did not exacerbate circulatory uremic toxin levels, renal inflammation, or fibrosis markers. In contrast, the higher KP-13 dose correlated with reduced posterior and anterior wall thickness, coupled with diminished cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas and concurrent elevation of inflammatory (Il6, Tnf), fibrosis (Col1), and apoptosis markers (Bax/Bcl2) relative to the CKD group. In summary, KP-13's influence on CKD and uremic cardiomyopathy encompassed heightened blood pressure and potentially activated inflammatory and apoptotic pathways in the left ventricle.",kidney disease

A reappraisal of risk factors for hypertension after pediatric acute kidney injury.,"['MitalPatel', 'ChristophHornik', 'ClarissaDiamantidis', 'David TSelewski', 'RasheedGbadegesin']","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is common in hospitalized children and increases the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension, but little is known about the patient level risk factors for pediatric hypertension after AKI. The aims of this study are to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors for new onset hypertension in hospitalized children with AKI and to better understand the role of acute kidney disease (AKD) in the development of hypertension.
This study was an observational cohort of all children ≤ 18 years old admitted to a single tertiary care children's hospital from 2015 to 2019 with a diagnosis of AKI. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure > 95th percentile for sex, age, height, diagnosis of hypertension on the problem list, or prescription of antihypertensive medication for > 90 days after AKI.
A total of 410 children were included in the cohort. Of these, 78 (19%) developed hypertension > 90 days after AKI. A multivariable logistic regression model identified AKD, need for kidney replacement therapy, congenital heart disease, and non-kidney solid organ transplantation as risk factors for hypertension after AKI.
Incident hypertension after 3 months is common among hospitalized children with AKI, and AKD, need for dialysis, congenital heart disease, and non-kidney solid organ transplant are significant risk factors for hypertension after AKI. Monitoring for hypertension development in these high-risk children is critical to mitigate long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes.

Data on the role of histological renal remission in predicting extra-renal flares is lacking. We assessed renal histopathology prior to drug withdrawal and the occurrence of renal and extra-renal flares over 52 weeks after drug withdrawal in PLN patients in long-term clinical remission. This is a subgroup analysis of a non-inferiority, open-label randomized (1:1) controlled trial. Patients with biopsy-proven Class III/IV LN in the past (biopsy 1), on immunosuppressants (IS) ≥ 3 years, in clinical remission for ≥ 1 year, on stable prednisolone dose (≤ 7.5 mg/day) plus a maintenance IS and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were subjected to a repeat renal biopsy (biopsy 2). Individuals with biopsy 2 having activity index (AI) < 4/24 were randomised to either prednisolone or IS withdrawal. Primary end-point was the proportion experiencing a flare [SELENA-SLEDAI flare index (SFI)] at week 52. Twenty-eight eligible patients underwent biopsy 2 and randomized to prednisolone (n = 15) and IS (n = 13) withdrawal. At biopsy 1, 12 (43%) had class III, 15 (53.5%) had class IV, and 1 (3.5%) had class III + V. At biopsy 2, PLN persisted in 4 (14.2%) while 18 (64.2%) were in histological remission (AI = 0) with 6 (21.4%) in class II. Following drug withdrawal, 9/28 (32%) had flares especially musculoskeletal (55.5%), mucocutaneous (44.4%), and renal (33.3%). Among the four persistent PLN patients, one of the two (50%) with AI = 1 had extra-renal flare while both the two with AI = 2 (100%) had renal and extra-renal flares. In those with histological remission (biopsy 2), 6/18 (66.6%) experienced extra-renal flare of whom one also had renal flare. Upon drug withdrawal, renal histopathology findings with any activity index can predict renal flare while histological remission is not enough to predict extra-renal flare, thus making it an unsuitable marker for deep SLE remission.",kidney disease
"The distribution of purinergic receptors, P2Y and P2X, expression within the intestine.","['Kristen AEngevik', 'Francesca JScribano', 'J ThomasGebert', 'Jacob LPerry', 'Sue ECrawford', 'Joseph MHyser']","Nucleotides are potent extracellular signaling molecules during homeostasis, infection, and injury due to their ability to activate purinergic receptors. The nucleotide ATP activates P2X receptors (P2RXs), while the nucleotides ADP, ATP, UTP and UDP-glucose selectively activate different P2Y receptors (P2RYs). Several studies have established crucial roles for P2 receptors during intestinal inflammatory and infectious diseases, yet the most extensive characterization of purinergic signaling has focused on immune cells and the central and enteric nervous systems. Since epithelial cells serve as the first barrier against irritants and infection, we hypothesized that the gut epithelium may express multiple purinergic receptors that respond to extracellular nucleotide signals. Using the Human Protein Atlas and Gut Cell Survey, we queried single cell RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data for the P2 purinergic receptors in the small and large intestine. ",kidney disease
Eryptosis: a driver of anemia in chronic kidney disease.,"['RosiBissinger', 'Syed MQadri', 'FerruhArtunc']","Anemia, characterized by a reduction in red blood cell (RBC) count or hemoglobin concentration, commonly accompanies chronic kidney disease (CKD), significantly impacting patients' quality of life. This review delves into the multifaceted nature of anemia in CKD, with a focus on novel mechanisms, particularly the dysregulation of eryptosis or programmed cell death of RBCs, leading to shortened RBC lifespan.
Recent studies in CKD patients and mouse models revealed that eryptosis, driven by factors such as uremic toxins, inflammation, and imbalances in calcium homeostasis, plays a pivotal role in the development of renal anemia. Dysregulated eryptosis results in premature RBC destruction, exacerbating the hypoproliferative character of anemia in CKD.
Recognizing the intricate relationship between eryptosis and anemia in CKD opens promising prospects for improving patient outcomes and enhancing our understanding of this complex condition. Future research and therapeutic development in this area hold the potential to improve anemia treatment of CKD patients.",kidney disease

Regarding monitoring, 70.9% (n = 290) recommended that stable patients be reassessed every 2-3 months or more frequently, but only 35.7% (n = 146) were able to comply with this periodicity due to owners' constraints.
The findings showed that although most survey respondents are aware of international guidelines for the clinical management of cats with CKD, the SBP measurement still needs to be more systematic to allow proper substaging and detection of systemic hypertension. The monitoring frequency was lower than recommended. Furthermore, the introduction of a renal therapeutic diet should be refined to improve its acceptance rate.",kidney disease

The impact on pregnancy outcomes of late-onset gestational diabetes mellitus diagnosed during the third trimester: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"['InshirahSgayer', 'MarwanOdeh', 'Maya FrankWolf', 'Raneen SawaidKaiyal', 'AlaAiob', 'LiorLowenstein', 'EduardGratacos']","Evidence is inconsistent regarding the impact of late gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on perinatal outcomes.
To evaluate associations of GDM diagnosed in the third trimester (late GDM) with adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes.
We searched Embase, Medline, and Web of Science from January 1, 1990 to June 16, 2022, for observational studies.
Late GDM was defined as a de novo diagnosis, i.e. after a negative screening for diabetes in the second trimester, and at later than 28 weeks of pregnancy.
Each abstract and full-text article was independently reviewed by the same two authors. Quality was assessed with the use of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random effects model.
Twelve studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria, including 3103 patients (571 with late GDM and 3103 controls). Incidences of shoulder dystocia (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02-2.42, P = 0.040), 5-minute Apgar score <7 (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.14-2.86, P = 0.024), cesarean delivery (OR 1.98, 95% CI 1.51-2.60, P < 0.001), and emergent cesarean delivery (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.02-2.40, P = 0.040) were significantly higher among women with late GDM than among the controls. The groups showed similarity in the rates of fetal macrosomia, large-for-gestational-age fetuses, neonatal hypoglycemia, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
This meta-analysis showed associations of late GDM with increased adverse perinatal outcomes. Prospective studies should evaluate the impact on perinatal outcomes of repeated third-trimester screening for late GDM.",kidney disease
Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19 Infection among Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Findings from the Philippine CORONA Study.,"['Roland Dominic GJamora', 'Albert BAlbay', 'Mary Bianca Doreen FDitching', 'Marie Charmaine CSy', 'Emilio QVillanueva', 'Adrian IEspiritu', 'Veeda Michelle MAnlacan']","The global pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in many deaths from fulminant respiratory failure. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There has been great concern regarding the impact of COPD on the COVID-19 illness.
Data from the Philippine CORONA study were analyzed to determine the association of COPD and COVID-19 in terms of mortality, disease severity, respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, and lengths of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital.
A total of 10,881 patients were included in this study, and 156 (1.4%) patients had been diagnosed with COPD. A majority of COVID-19 patients with COPD had other existing comorbidities: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic cardiac disease, and chronic kidney disease. COPD patients were 2.0× more likely to present with severe to critical COVID-19 disease. COVID-19 patients with COPD in our study have a 1.7× increased mortality, 1.6× increased respiratory failure, and 2.0× increased risk for ICU admission. Smokers with COVID-19 were 1.8× more likely to present with more severe disease and have a 1.9× increased mortality.
Our study supports the growing evidence that COPD among COVID-19 patients is a risk factor for higher mortality, more severe form of COVID-19, higher ICU admission, and higher respiratory failure needing ventilatory support.",kidney disease

In this narrative review, we retrospectively inquired into the clinical trials and real-world studies investigating the efficacy of these agents. Overall, clinical trials and real-world studies have demonstrated the efficacy of both agents in reducing hospitalization and death rates in COVID-19 patients. As per current recommendations, their use is suggested in patients with mild to moderate symptoms who are at high risk of developing severe disease.

"A Simple, Rapid, and Effective Heparinase Protocol to Enable Nucleic Acid Study from Frozen Heparinized Plasma.","['RownockAfruza', 'NicoleMinerva', 'Justin BLack', 'MoumitaChakraborty', 'James AHaddad', 'Rabab OAli', 'ChristopherKoh', 'Elliot BLevy', 'OhadEtzion', 'TheoHeller']","Cell-free RNAs (cfRNAs) are promising analytes as non-invasive biomarkers and have even greater potential if tied in with metabolomics. Plasma is an optimal source for cfRNAs but is often derived from a variety of anticoagulants. Plasma obtained in heparin is suitable for metabolomics but is difficult to utilize for qPCR-based downstream analysis. In the present study, we aimed to develop a simple, time-efficient, and cost-effective heparinase protocol, followed by library preparation and sequencing of human plasma cfRNAs drawn and stored in heparin at -80 °C for several years. Blood was collected in CPT™ sodium heparin tubes from patients with chronic HCV infection (NCT02400216) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. Plasma cfRNAs were treated with heparinase I and used for library preparation and next-generation sequencing (NGS). Heparinase treatment maintained RNA integrity and allowed for successful library preparation for all the study subjects even with 7 ng of cfRNAs as starting material. The classification report derived from Pavian R package v1.2.0 showed no artificial reads. The abundance of chordate over microbial reads suggests no addition of experimental error through heparinase I treatment. We report a novel and practical approach to heparinase treatment for human plasma collected and frozen in sodium heparin for several years. This is an effective demonstration of utilizing heparin plasma for NGS and downstream transcriptomic research, which could then be integrated with metabolomics from the same samples, maximizing efficiency and minimizing blood draws.",kidney disease
Urinary Klotho Excretion: A Key Regulator of Sodium Homeostasis in Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 2-4.,"['Po-JuiChi', 'Chung-JenLee', 'Shih-YuanHung', 'Jen-PiTsai', 'Hung-HsiangLiou']","BACKGROUND Soluble alpha-klotho (klotho) is considered an important regulator of mineral homeostasis in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Since the mineral transport proteins are located on the apical membrane of renal tubular cells, we hypothesized that urine klotho may also be involved in their homeostasis. We aimed to investigate the associations between serum and urine klotho and their impacts on mineral homeostasis in patients with stage 2 to 4 CKD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Serum, spot urine, and 24-h urine of klotho were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fractional excretion of sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and klotho were calculated. RESULTS A total of 53 patients with CKD stages 2 to 4 were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The mean age was 71.1±10.5 years, and 68% were men. Linear regression analysis showed that serum log-transformed klotho was negatively associated with log-transformed fractional excretion of klotho (log-FEKlotho) (ß=-0.085, P=0.02), showing that urinary klotho excretion could negatively regulate serum klotho levels. Moreover, our multivariate stepwise regression showed log-fractional excretion of sodium was positively associated with log-FEKlotho (ß=0.138, P=0.032). This implied urinary klotho excretion positively regulated urinary sodium excretion. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that urine klotho excretion resulted in decreased serum klotho levels and enhanced urinary sodium excretion in patients with CKD stages 2 to 4. In addition to serum klotho, we found, for the first time, that urine klotho also played a significant role in sodium homeostasis.",kidney disease

Latent class analyses using Mplus were carried out in the Growing Up Today Study. Information on participants' weight status, disordered eating behaviors, body image and weight concerns, depressive symptoms, and pubertal timing, as well as and maternal weight status, were included in the latent class analyses, which were stratified by sex. Mixed-effects regression was used to examine associations of the obesity phenotypes with adult weight gain, between age 20 and 35 years, independent of weight at beginning of follow-up and duration of follow-up.
Among the girls, four obesity phenotypes were identified: 1) ""early puberty""; 2) ""mothers with obesity""; 3) ""high weight concerns""; and 4) ""mixed."" Only three phenotypes were identified among the boys: 1) ""high weight concerns""; 2) ""mothers with obesity""; and 3) ""mixed."" Participants who had overweight or obesity in childhood or adolescence gained more weight in young adulthood than their leaner peers, but the patterns of weight gain in young adulthood varied by phenotype of obesity in childhood and adolescence.
These results support examining risk factors for and treatment outcomes by obesity phenotypes.",kidney disease

A retrospective cohort study was conducted. The clinical data of patients with sepsis-induced AKI admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from July 2021 to December 2022 were enrolled. The basic information of the patients were collect, including age, gender, site of infection, underlying disease, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) at admission, as well as the use of mechanical ventilation and vasoactive drugs, and norepinephrine (NE) dosage. Laboratory indicators, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and PPI within 24 hours of admission were also recorded, and the patient's prognosis during ICU hospitalization was also recorded. The differences in clinical data between the patients of two groups with different prognosis were compared. Spearman correlation method was used to analyze the correlation between PPI and SOFA score. Binary multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to screen independent risk factors for death during ICU hospitalization in sepsis patients with AKI. Receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was plotted to evaluate the predictive value of PPI for the short-term prognosis of patients with sepsis-induced AKI.
A total of 102 patients with sepsis-induced AKI were enrolled, of which 70 patients in the survival group and 32 patients in the death group, with ICU mortality of 31.4.

Prognosis of Chronic Kidney Disease and Metabolic Syndrome in Adults With Congenital Heart Disease.,"['Shin YiJang', 'Eun KyoungKim', 'Sung-AChang', 'JuneHuh', 'JinyoungSong', 'I-SeokKang', 'Seung WooPark']","Few studies have examined the incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic syndrome (MS) and their combined prognostic effects in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD). Our aims were to identify the incidence and prognostic implications of CKD and MS in ACHD.
This is retrospective cohort study. We included 2,462 ACHD ≥ 20 years of age who were treated at a tertiary hospital in Korea from 2006 to 2018. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73m². MS was diagnosed based on the presence of abnormal metabolic parameters: blood sugar level, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality from 2006 through 2019 using data from the Ministry of the Interior and Safety in Korea.
The incidence of CKD and MS in ACHD was 7.6% and 35.9%, respectively. The coexistence rate of CKD and MS was 4.6%. Although MS was not independently associated with mortality in the multiple analysis (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-1.46), it was closely related to the presence of CKD (adjusted odds ratio, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.89-3.63). ACHD patients with CKD had a significantly increased risk of mortality compared with those without CKD (aHR, 2.84; 95% CI, 2.00-4.04).
In patients with ACHD, the distribution of MS is higher, and both MS and its components were associated with CKD. Given the CKD was independently associated with mortality, close monitoring and management of renal dysfunction and metabolic parameters in ACHD patients is needed.",kidney disease
Single Nucleus RNA Sequencing of Remnant Kidney Biopsies and Urine Cell RNA Sequencing Reveal Cell Specific Markers of Covid-19 Acute Kidney Injury.,"['ReetikaGhag', 'MadhurimaKaushal', 'GeraldNwanne', 'AmandaKnoten', 'KrzysztofKiryluk', 'AviRosenberg', 'SteveMenez', 'Serena MBagnasco', 'C JohnSperati', 'Mohamed GAtta', 'Joseph PGaut', 'James CWilliams', 'Tarek MEl-Achkar', 'Lois JArend', 'Chirag RParikh', 'SanjayJain']","Acute kidney injury (AKI) in COVID-19 patients is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Critically ill COVID-19 patients are at twice the risk of in-hospital mortality compared to non-COVID AKI patients. We know little about the cell-specific mechanism in the kidney that contributes to worse clinical outcomes in these patients. New generation single cell technologies have the potential to provide insights into physiological states and molecular mechanisms in COVID-AKI. One of the key limitations is that these patients are severely ill posing significant risks in procuring additional biopsy tissue. We recently generated single nucleus RNA-sequencing data using COVID-AKI patient biopsy tissue as part of the human kidney atlas. Here we describe this approach in detail and report deeper comparative analysis of snRNAseq of 4 COVID-AKI, 4 reference, and 6 non-COVID-AKI biopsies. We also generated and analyzed urine transcriptomics data to find overlapping COVID-AKI-enriched genes and their corresponding cell types in the kidney from snRNA-seq data. We identified all major and minor cell types and states by using by using less than a few cubic millimeters of leftover tissue after pathological workup in our approach. Differential expression analysis of COVID-AKI biopsies showed pathways enriched in viral response, WNT signaling, kidney development, and cytokines in several nephron epithelial cells. COVID-AKI profiles showed a much higher proportion of altered TAL cells than non-COVID AKI and the reference samples. In addition to kidney injury and fibrosis markers indicating robust remodeling we found that, 17 genes overlap between urine cell COVID-AKI transcriptome and the snRNA-seq data from COVID-AKI biopsies. A key feature was that several of the distal nephron and collecting system cell types express these markers. Some of these markers have been previously observed in COVID-19 studies suggesting a common mechanism of injury and potentially the kidney as one of the sources of soluble factors with a potential role in disease progression.
The manuscript describes innovation, application and discovery that impact clinical care in kidney disease. First, the approach to maximize use of remnant frozen clinical biopsies to inform on clinically relevant molecular features can augment existing pathological workflow for any frozen tissue without much change in the protocol. Second, this approach is transformational in medical crises such as pandemics where mechanistic insights are needed to evaluate organ injury, targets for drug therapy and diagnostic and prognostic markers. Third, the cell type specific and soluble markers identified and validated can be used for diagnoses or prognoses in AKI due to different etiologies and in multiorgan injury.",kidney disease

Particularly challenging is the task of determining the potential for recovery from acute kidney injury following various insults. Here, we report that quantitation of post-transcriptional adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing offers a distinct genome-wide signature, enabling the delineation of disease trajectories in the kidney. A well-defined murine model of endotoxemia permitted the identification of the origin and extent of A-to-I editing, along with temporally discrete signatures of double-stranded RNA stress and Adenosine Deaminase isoform switching. We found that A-to-I editing of Antizyme Inhibitor 1 (AZIN1), a positive regulator of polyamine biosynthesis, serves as a particularly useful temporal landmark during endotoxemia. Our data indicate that AZIN1 A-to-I editing, triggered by preceding inflammation, primes the kidney and activates endogenous recovery mechanisms. By comparing genetically modified human cell lines and mice locked in either A-to-I edited or uneditable states, we uncovered that AZIN1 A-to-I editing not only enhances polyamine biosynthesis but also engages glycolysis and nicotinamide biosynthesis to drive the recovery phenotype. Our findings implicate that quantifying AZIN1 A-to-I editing could potentially identify individuals who have transitioned to an endogenous recovery phase. This phase would reflect their past inflammation and indicate their potential for future recovery.",kidney disease

Pooled cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2009-2014) were used (n = 8993). Periodontitis was defined by a full-mouth examination and classified as no/mild and moderate/severe (mod/sev) groups. Blood and urinary heavy metal levels were investigated, including cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg). In addition, systemic inflammation was assessed using circulatory leukocyte counts and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.
Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the positive associations of blood and urinary levels of Cd and Pb with mod/sev periodontitis. In contrast,blood Hg levels did not show a significant association. The odds of having periodontitis were 1.233 and 1.311 times higher for each one-unit increment in Ln-transformed blood Cd (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.109-1.371) and Pb (95% CI: 1.170-1.470), respectively. Mediation analysis suggested a 6.3% to 11.5% contribution of leucocyte counts in the association of blood Cd and Pb levels with periodontitis. Sensitivity analyses for urinary Cd levels yielded consistent mediating effects. However, no significant mediating effect of CRP was detected.
Higher exposures to Cd and Pb were positively associated with periodontitis risk. These associations might be partially mediated by the elevated levels of leukocytes rather than CRP. Further longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the discordant results of the systemic inflammatory biomarkers.",kidney disease

In this retrospective study, we enrolled patients with ALF (serum total bilirubin >10 mg/dL or Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD] Score >18) hospitalized between August 2017 and August 2022. All patients had at least two sessions of FPSA-CVVH. The primary measure of treatment efficacy was the reduction ratios (RRs) of bilirubin after each session of FPSA-CVVH.
Seventy-eight patients with ALF were enrolled. The MELD score at baseline was 22.9 ± 7.5. The mean total bilirubin was 22.05 ± 5.94 mg/dL, direct bilirubin was 16.33 ± 4.60 mg/dL and indirect bilirubin was 3.43 ± 1.60 mg/dL. One hundred and eighty seven sessions of FPSA-CVVH treatment lasting 8 hours each were performed. After a single session, serum total bilirubin, direct bilirubin and indirect bilirubin were significantly decreased. RRs were 52.0% ± 7.6% for total bilirubin, 59.4% ± 13.0% for direct bilirubin and 36.9% ± 15.4% for indirect bilirubin. Twenty nine patients (37.2%) survived and were discharged from the hospital, 12 of them recovered their liver function while the remaining 17 patients needed intermittent artificial liver support therapy.

At the end of the follow-up, the incidence of infectious diseases was 52% versus 50% (P = .71) and AR was 5% versus 5% (P = .86), respectively. The survival rate free of gastrointestinal (GI) complications requiring medical attention was higher in the low-dose group than in the standard-dose dose (88% vs 45%, respectively; P < .001). The use of 1.5 g/day of MMF confers a reduction in GI complications without an increase in infectious diseases or the risk of AR.",kidney disease
Pregnancy in women with autosomal recessive Alport syndrome caused by novel compound heterozygous mutations of COL4A3 gene: Two cases reports.,"['XiaoliGao', 'MeiluLi', 'KanWang', 'ZengyanLi', 'ChaHan']","Autosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ARAS) is an hereditary heterogeneous disease that poses a serious risk to pregnant women.
We reported 2 cases of pregnancy with progressive proteinuria. The case 1 was a 21-year-old woman with 24-h proteinuria increased from 2.03 to 11.72 g at 13 to 35 weeks of gestation, and the case 2 was a 28-year-old woman with 24-h proteinuria increased from 2.10 to 9.32 g at 8 to 36 weeks of gestation. In advanced stage of pregnancy, the fetal development was smaller than the gestational age.
Sanger sequencing showed that novel compound heterozygous mutations [c.1315 G>T (p.G439C) and c.4847 G>A (p.C1616Y)] of the collagen type IV alpha 3 chain (COL4A3) gene were found in the 2 cases. Renal puncture pathology confirmed the diagnosis of ARAS.
The 2 cases were treated with albumin, compounded amino acids, calcium, vitamin D, and low molecular weight heparin in addition to conventional treatment during pregnancy. Pregnancy was terminated by cesarean section at 36 to 37 weeks of gestation. After delivery, the patients were treated with Losartan for anti-proteinuric therapy for 1 year.
The neonatal weights and Apgar scores were normal. The patients recovered well and 24-h proteinuria decreased to pre-pregnancy level.
When pregnant women present with a persistent increasing proteinuria, ARAS needs to be considered. Sanger sequencing is useful to assist in the diagnosis of ARAS. Multidisciplinary treatments from nephrologists and gynecologists are needed to ensure the safety of pregnancy and the fetus.",kidney disease
Expression and clinical implications of HLA-G and PD-L1 following kidney transplantation: A cohort study.,"['Silvia MBotelho', 'Isabela JWastowski', 'Renata TSimões', 'Maria A P CCysneiros', 'Antonioda Silva Menezes', 'Aline LRezende', 'Nílzio Ada Silva']","Kidney transplantation (KT) is the preferred treatment for end-stage renal diseases. Human leukocyte antigen G (HLA-G) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have notable clinical and therapeutic significance in transplantation because of their roles in promoting tolerance. This study aimed to assess HLA-G and PD-L1 levels at various stages following KT. A cohort of 12 patients was monitored from the pretransplant phase to 12 months post-surgery. Blood samples were taken at specific intervals: before kidney transplantation (T0), and then on the 7th (T7), 30th (T30), 90th (T90), 180th (T180), and 365th days post transplantation. Renal biopsies were performed in patients with graft dysfunction. Plasma levels of soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) and PD-L1 were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Additionally, immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of both molecules in biopsy samples. Multivariate analysis indicated that episodes of rejection were correlated with decreased expression of sHLA-G (P < .001) and PD-L1 (P < .001). Over the course of the study, the sHLA-G levels also declined (P < .001). Patients who had been transfused had lower PD-L1 levels (P = .03). Furthermore, kidney recipients from related live donors had increased HLA-G expression (P < .001). Our findings suggest that diminished HLA-G and PD-L1 levels correlate with an increased risk of graft rejection. Notably, HLA-G expression significantly decrease after the third-month posttransplantation.",kidney disease
"Incidence, mortality and survival of transitional cell carcinoma in the urinary system: A population-based analysis.","['XiaofengTang', 'XiangpengZhan', 'XiaominChen']","The goal of this study is exploring the disparity of incidence, mortality and survival outcome among transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) in the 4 parts of urinary system. This study comprehensively evaluates these disparities using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) (2000-2018) database. According to the SEER database, the urinary tract is divided into 4 parts: urinary bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, and urethra. The joinpoint regression was used to analyze the secular trend of incidence and incidence-based mortality (IBM). The Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test is performed to evaluate survival outcomes. The bladder TCC has the highest age-adjusted incidence and mortality rate compared with TCC in other 3 locations. A slight decrease in incidence is shown in the both bladder and urethra TCCs during 2000-2018. The age-adjusted mortality rate similarly presents an initial increase among 4 locations TCCs at the beginning of study period. The survival curves demonstrate that patients with bladder TCCs have better overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), whereas those with renal pelvis TCCs have the worse OS and CSS. In addition, patients with bladder TCC have the highest 1-year, 3-year, 5-year relative survival rate, and those with renal pelvis TCC have the lowest. These disparities are especially essential when we explore tumor characteristics and treatment, extrapolated from the literature on bladder TCC for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). Notably, patients with bladder TCC especially for localized stage have better survival outcomes than those with UTUC.",kidney disease
Vascular endothelial growth factor-D plasma levels in fluid overload and cardiac function evaluation of elderly patients with cardiovascular disease.,"['JunLi', 'Xiao-LinLi', 'Fa-HuLiu', 'Ya-FenYu', 'YuanDu']","This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) subtypes and growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) plasma levels in evaluating the fluid overload and cardiac function of elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. The plasma levels of VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and GDF-15 were measured using ELISA. Their correlations with N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro BNP) and echocardiography data were analyzed. 1. Higher plasma levels of VEGF-D and GDF-15 were observed in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease and heart failure(P < .01). VEGF-D plasma levels were higher in patients with chronic heart failure than those with acute myocardial infarction (P < .01). VEGF-D plasma levels were positively correlated with amino-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) (P < .001). VEGF-D plasma levels were positively correlated with echocardiographic parameters, including left atrial diameter, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and left ventricular ejection fraction, in patients with cardiovascular disease (P < .01). 2. VEGF-C plasma levels were higher in acute myocardial infarction group (P < .05). The plasma levels of VEGF-C were not correlated with either VEGF-D or NT-pro BNP plasma levels. VEGF-C plasma levels had no correlation with echocardiographic parameters. 3. GDF-15 plasma levels were positively correlated with sera biomarkers of cardiac injury (creatine kinase isoenzyme MB and cardiac troponin I). GDF-15 plasma levels were positively correlated with urinary biomarkers of tubular injury (N-acetyl-β-galactosidase and α1-microglobulin). Both GDF-15 and NT-pro BNP plasma levels were correlated with age, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and nutritional biomarkers (albumin and hemoglobin plasma levels). VEGF-D plasma levels is a potential biomarker of fluid overload and cardiac function in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. Age, nutrition, and kidney injury are factors influencing both GDF-15 and NT-pro BNP plasma levels in estimating cardiac function and fluid overload.",kidney disease
Acute exacerbation of immunoglobulin A nephropathy complicated by alveolar hemorrhage after coronavirus disease 2019 vaccination: A case report.,"['TakahiroUchida', 'TakashiSakai', 'TakahikoHoshino', 'AkiKojima', 'OsamuKonno', 'MuneharuYamada', 'HitoshiIwamoto', 'TakashiOda']","Reports have suggested a relationship between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination and new-onset or recurring renal diseases, of which immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy is a representative disease. Alveolar hemorrhage in patients with IgA nephropathy is rare but reportedly has a high mortality and morbidity. To our knowledge, there have been no reports regarding the development of IgA nephropathy with alveolar hemorrhage following COVID-19 vaccination.
A 23-year-old Japanese man presented with hemoptysis and peripheral edema a few days after receiving a second dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine. Severe renal failure and alveolar hemorrhage were noted thereafter, and renal biopsy showed crescentic glomerulonephritis with mesangial proliferation accompanied by mesangial electron-dense deposits containing IgA. Renal biopsy tissue also showed chronic histological changes suggestive of acute exacerbation of preexisting IgA nephropathy.
The diagnosis of IgA nephropathy complicated by alveolar hemorrhage was made.
Renal function did not recover despite treatment with high-dose steroids; the patient was maintained on hemodialysis and eventually underwent successful renal transplantation.
The present case suggested that although extremely rare, severe renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy could occur in patients with IgA nephropathy after COVID-19 vaccination. Future accumulation of similar cases is needed to predict the risk of renal injury following vaccination.",kidney disease
Management of hypertensive crisis in a patient with underlying kidney disease: A case report.,"['ChukwukaElendu', 'Dependable CAmaechi', 'Tochi CElendu', 'Yuliana Paola OrosSucari', 'Sehajmeet KaurSaggi', 'KanishkDang', 'Jennifer OIbhiedu']","This case report elucidates the management of a hypertensive crisis in a patient with underlying kidney disease, shedding light on the intricate interplay between these conditions. This unique case contributes valuable insights to the scientific literature.
The patient exhibited severe headache, visual disturbances, and chest pain. Clinical evaluation revealed elevated blood pressure and impaired kidney function, emphasizing the importance of monitoring hypertension and renal health in such cases.
The primary diagnoses included malignant hypertension and underlying kidney disease. Immediate interventions comprised intravenous antihypertensive agents and rigorous hemodynamic monitoring, yielding favorable outcomes. Blood pressure gradually returned to acceptable levels, and renal function improved during treatment.
This case underscores the critical need for timely recognition and management of hypertensive crises in patients with preexisting kidney dysfunction. Simultaneously addressing both conditions is vital for successful outcomes. Healthcare practitioners must remain vigilant in assessing the intricate relationship between hypertension and kidney disease, employing tailored interventions for optimal results.
The primary lesson from this case is the necessity of a comprehensive approach to managing hypertensive crises in individuals with underlying kidney disease. Early intervention and a multidisciplinary strategy are essential to achieve positive clinical outcomes and prevent potential complications.",kidney disease
Glucocorticoid impact therapy for recurrent IgG4-related disease with diabetes insipidus as the main manifestation: A case report and literature review.,"['YongzhuoYu', 'LiliXu', 'YunyangWang', 'WenxuanLi', 'YangangWang']","There is a relative wealth of experience in the initial treatment of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), but little is known about therapeutic measures for recurrent cases combined with multiple organ and tissue involvement.
A 43-year-old man with a previous diagnosis of IgG4-RD due to recurrent right lacrimal gland enlargement with eyelid erythema presented with diabetes insipidus.
We performed a pituitary Magnetic Resonance Imaging which revealed posterior pituitary rim changes with inhomogeneous enhancement and nodular-like thickening of the pituitary stalk, and performed a water-deprivation-vasopressin test confirmed central diabetes insipidus, and in combination with the patient's elevated IgG4 levels and past medical conditions, we diagnosed central diabetes insipidus, IgG4-related hypophysitis, and IgG4-RD.
After the patient was admitted to the hospital we gave methylprednisolone 500 mg intravenously once daily for 4 days and again for 4 consecutive days after a 10-day interval. During this period combined with mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg twice daily and desmopressin acetate 0.1 mg 3 times daily.
The patient was followed up for a sustained period of 6 months and no side effects of glucocorticoid therapy were noted, there were no signs of recurrence, and the daily urine output stabilized in the normal range.
We recognized that IgG4 levels do not reflect relapse or long-term control, and that glucocorticoid shock therapy is an optional and reliable treatment strategy for relapsed patients.",kidney disease
Comparing Effects of Tolvaptan and Instruction to Increase Water Consumption in ADPKD: Post-hoc Analysis of TEMPO 3:4.,"['JogaGobburu', 'VijayIvaturi', 'XiaofengWang', 'Susan EShoaf', 'PravinJadhav', 'Ronald DPerrone']","In addition to decreasing water excretion and increasing urinary concentration, the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin plays a role in the pathophysiology of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). It has been hypothesized that by suppressing vasopressin release, drinking large amounts of water might exert therapeutic effects in ADPKD similar to those of tolvaptan, an antagonist of the vasopressin type 2 receptor, but evidence is lacking. We analyzed data from tolvaptan clinical trials to evaluate relationships among water intake, urine osmolality (Uosm), and change in total kidney volume (TKV).
Analysis of the TEMPO 3:4 clinical trial in which participants were randomized to tolvaptan or placebo and instructed to drink large amounts of water. The relationship between change in spot Uosm from baseline to Week 3 and change in TKV to Month 12 was assessed using linear regression modeling. Two short-term tolvaptan trials were analyzed to explore relationships between intermittent Uosm sampling and 24-hour Uosm suppression.
With both tolvaptan and placebo (i.e., mandated high water intake alone), Uosm reduction at Week 3 was associated with reduction in TKV growth at Month 12. However, for the same decrease in spot Uosm, the corresponding reduction in TKV growth was greater for tolvaptan (for example, a -250 mOsm/kg reduction in Uosm at Week 3 was associated with a -1% change in TKV at Month 12 for tolvaptan versus +4.5% for placebo). In short-term trials, similar reductions in spot or trough Uosm values were achievable with tolvaptan and high water intake, but cumulative 24-hour suppression was greater with tolvaptan.
This analysis supports a relationship between effects on Uosm and inhibition of disease progression by tolvaptan and high water intake alone. The findings further suggest that 24-hour Uosm measurement is superior to spot Uosm for assessing suppression of vasopressin activity by tolvaptan.",kidney disease
An external validation of the Kidney Donor Risk Index in the UK transplant population in the presence of semi-competing events.,"['StephanieRiley', 'KimberlyTam', 'Wai-YeeTse', 'AndrewConnor', 'YinghuiWei']","Transplantation represents the optimal treatment for many patients with end-stage kidney disease. When a donor kidney is available to a waitlisted patient, clinicians responsible for the care of the potential recipient must make the decision to accept or decline the offer based upon complex and variable information about the donor, the recipient and the transplant process. A clinical prediction model may be able to support clinicians in their decision-making. The Kidney Donor Risk Index (KDRI) was developed in the United States to predict graft failure following kidney transplantation. The survival process following transplantation consists of semi-competing events where death precludes graft failure, but not vice-versa.
We externally validated the KDRI in the UK kidney transplant population and assessed whether validation under a semi-competing risks framework impacted predictive performance. Additionally, we explored whether the KDRI requires updating. We included 20,035 adult recipients of first, deceased donor, single, kidney-only transplants between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2018, collected by the UK Transplant Registry and held by NHS Blood and Transplant. The outcomes of interest were 1- and 5-year graft failure following transplantation. In light of the semi-competing events, recipient death was handled in two ways: censoring patients at the time of death and modelling death as a competing event. Cox proportional hazard models were used to validate the KDRI when censoring graft failure by death, and cause-specific Cox models were used to account for death as a competing event.
The KDRI underestimated event probabilities for those at higher risk of graft failure. For 5-year graft failure, discrimination was poorer in the semi-competing risks model (0.625, 95% CI 0.611 to 0.640;0.611, 95% CI 0.597 to 0.625), but predictions were more accurate (Brier score 0.117, 95% CI 0.112 to 0.121; 0.114, 95% CI 0.109 to 0.118). Calibration plots were similar regardless of whether the death was modelled as a competing event or not. Updating the KDRI worsened calibration, but marginally improved discrimination.
Predictive performance for 1-year graft failure was similar between death-censored and competing event graft failure, but differences appeared when predicting 5-year graft failure. The updated index did not have superior performance and we conclude that updating the KDRI in the present form is not required.",kidney disease
The alternative renin-angiotensin system in critically ill patients: pathophysiology and therapeutic implications.,"['BrunoGarcia', 'AlexanderZarbock', 'RinaldoBellomo', 'MatthieuLegrand']","The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure and the cardio-renal system. The classical RAS, mainly mediated by angiotensin I, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensin II, has been reported to be altered in critically ill patients, such as those in vasodilatory shock. However, recent research has highlighted the role of some components of the counterregulatory axis of the classical RAS, termed the alternative RAS, such as angiotensin-converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and angiotensin-(1-7), or peptidases which can modulate the RAS like dipeptidyl-peptidase 3, in many critical situations. In cases of shock, dipeptidyl-peptidase 3, an enzyme involved in the degradation of angiotensin and opioid peptides, has been associated with acute kidney injury and mortality and preclinical studies have tested its neutralization. Angiotensin-(1-7) has been shown to prevent septic shock development and improve outcomes in experimental models of sepsis. In the context of experimental acute lung injury, ACE2 activity has demonstrated a protective role, and its inactivation has been associated with worsened lung function, leading to the use of active recombinant human ACE2, in preclinical and human studies. Angiotensin-(1-7) has been tested in experimental models of acute lung injury and in a recent randomized controlled trial for patients with COVID-19 related hypoxemia. Overall, the alternative RAS appears to have a role in the pathogenesis of disease in critically ill patients, and modulation of the alternative RAS may improve outcomes. Here, we review the available evidence regarding the methods of analysis of the RAS, pathophysiological disturbances of this system, and discuss how therapeutic manipulation may improve outcomes in the critically ill.",kidney disease
Kidney phosphate wasting predicts poor outcome in polycystic kidney disease.,"['LaixiXue', 'FrankGeurts', 'EstherMeijer', 'Martin Hde Borst', 'Ron TGansevoort', 'RobertZietse', 'Ewout JHoorn', 'MahdiSalih', 'NoneNone']","Patients with ADPKD have disproportionately high levels of fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) for their CKD-stage with only a subgroup that develops kidney phosphate wasting. We assessed factors associated with phosphate wasting and hypothesize that it identifies patients with more severe disease and predicts disease progression.
We included 604 patients with ADPKD from a multi-center prospective observational (DIPAK) cohort in 4 university medical centers in the Netherlands. We measured parathyroid hormone (PTH), total plasma FGF-23 levels and calculated the ratio of tubular maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate to glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR) with < 0.8 mmol/L defined as kidney phosphate wasting. We analysed the association of TmP/GFR with eGFR decline over time and the risk for a composite kidney outcome (≥ 30% eGFR decline, kidney failure or kidney replacement therapy).
In our cohort (age 48 ± 12 years, 39% male, eGFR 63 ± 28 mL/min/1.73m2), 59% of patients had phosphate wasting. Male sex (coefficient -0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.2; -0.1), eGFR (0.002, 0.001-0.004), FGF-23 (0.1, 0.03-0.2), PTH(-0.2, -0.3; -0.06) and Copeptin(-0.08, -0.1; -0.08) were associated with TmP/GFR. Corrected for PTH, FGF-23 and eGFR, every 0.1 mmol/L decrease in TmP/GFR was associated with a greater eGFR decline of 0.2 ml/min/1.73m2/year (95% CI 0.01-0.3) and an increased hazard ratio of 1.09 (95% CI 1.01-1.18) of the composite kidney outcome.
Our study shows that in patients with ADPKD phosphate wasting is prevalent and associated with more rapid disease progression. Phosphate wasting may be a consequence of early proximal tubular dysfunction and insufficient suppression of PTH.",kidney disease
"Differences in the epidemiology, management and outcomes of kidney disease in men and women.","['Nicholas CChesnaye', 'Juan JesusCarrero', 'ManfredHecking', 'Kitty JJager']","Improved understanding of differences in kidney disease epidemiology, management and outcomes in men and women could help nephrologists to better meet the needs of their patients from a sex- and gender-specific perspective. Evidence of sex differences in the risk and outcomes of acute kidney injury is mixed and dependent on aetiology. Women have a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3-5 than men, whereas men have a higher prevalence of albuminuria and hence CKD stages 1-2. Men show a faster decline in kidney function, progress more frequently to kidney failure and have higher mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease than women. However, the protective effect of female sex is reduced with CKD progression. Women are less likely than men to be aware of, screened for and diagnosed with CKD, started on antiproteinuric medication and referred to nephrologist care. They also consistently report a poorer health-related quality of life and a higher symptom burden than men. Women experience greater barriers than men to access the waiting list for kidney transplantation, particularly with respect to older age and obesity. However, women also have longer survival than men after transplantation, which may partly explain the comparable prevalence of transplantation between the sexes.",kidney disease
The immunoregulatory roles of non-haematopoietic cells in the kidney.,"['George CTsokos', 'AfroditiBoulougoura', 'VivekKasinath', 'YushiroEndo', 'RezaAbdi', 'HaoLi']","The deposition of immune complexes, activation of complement and infiltration of the kidney by cells of the adaptive and innate immune systems have long been considered responsible for the induction of kidney damage in autoimmune, alloimmune and other inflammatory kidney diseases. However, emerging findings have highlighted the contribution of resident immune cells and of immune molecules expressed by kidney-resident parenchymal cells to disease processes. Several types of kidney parenchymal cells seem to express a variety of immune molecules with a distinct topographic distribution, which may reflect the exposure of these cells to different pathogenic threats or microenvironments. A growing body of literature suggests that these cells can stimulate the infiltration of immune cells that provide protection against infections or contribute to inflammation - a process that is also regulated by draining kidney lymph nodes. Moreover, components of the immune system, such as autoantibodies, cytokines and immune cells, can influence the metabolic profile of kidney parenchymal cells in the kidney, highlighting the importance of crosstalk in pathogenic processes. The development of targeted nanomedicine approaches that modulate the immune response or control inflammation and damage directly within the kidney has the potential to eliminate the need for systemically acting drugs.",kidney disease
"Leveraging diverse cell-death patterns to predict the prognosis, immunotherapy and drug sensitivity of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","['XiZhang', 'MingcongZhang', 'LebinSong', 'ShuaiWang', 'XiyiWei', 'WenchuanShao', 'NinghongSong']","Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) poses clinical challenges due to its varied prognosis, tumor microenvironment attributes, and responses to immunotherapy. We established a novel Programmed Cell Death-related Signature (PRS) for ccRCC assessment, derived through the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression method. We validated PRS using the E-MTAB-1980 dataset and created PCD-related clusters via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). Our investigation included an in-depth analysis of immune infiltration scores using various algorithms. Additionally, we integrated data from the Cancer Immunome Atlas (TCIA) for ccRCC immunotherapy insights and leveraged the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database to assess drug sensitivity models. We complemented our findings with single-cell sequencing data and employed the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and qRT-PCR to compare gene expression profiles between cancerous and paracancerous tissues. PRS serves as a valuable tool for prognostication, immune characterization, tumor mutation burden estimation, immunotherapy response prediction, and drug sensitivity assessment in ccRCC. We identify five genes with significant roles in cancer promotion and three genes with cancer-suppressive properties, further validated by qRT-PCR and CPTAC analyses, showcasing gene expression differences in ccRCC tissues. Our study introduces an innovative PCD model that amalgamates diverse cell death patterns to provide accurate predictions for clinical outcomes, mutational profiles, and immune characteristics in ccRCC.

Validation of risk scores for prediction of severe pneumonia in kidney transplant recipients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.,"['MoritzMüller-Plathe', 'BilginOsmanodja', 'GeorgBarthel', 'KlemensBudde', 'Kai-UweEckardt', 'MartinKolditz', 'MartinWitzenrath']","Risk scores for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are widely used for standardized assessment in immunocompetent patients and to identify patients at risk for severe pneumonia and death. In immunocompromised patients, the prognostic value of pneumonia-specific risk scores seems to be reduced, but evidence is limited. The value of different pneumonia risk scores in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) is not known.
Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed 310 first CAP episodes after kidney transplantation in 310 KTR. We assessed clinical outcomes and validated eight different risk scores (CRB-65, CURB-65, DS-CRB-65, qSOFA, SOFA, PSI, IDSA/ATS minor criteria, NEWS-2) for the prognosis of severe pneumonia and in-hospital mortality. Risk scores were assessed up to 48 h after admission, but always before an endpoint occurred. Multiple imputation was performed to handle missing values.
In total, 16 out of 310 patients (5.2%) died, and 48 (15.5%) developed severe pneumonia. Based on ROC analysis, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) and national early warning score 2 (NEWS-2) performed best, predicting severe pneumonia with AUC of 0.823 (0.747-0.880) and 0.784 (0.691-0.855), respectively.
SOFA and NEWS-2 are best suited to identify KTR at risk for the development of severe CAP. In contrast to immunocompetent patients, CRB-65 should not be used to guide outpatient treatment in KTR, since there is a 7% risk for the development of severe pneumonia even in patients with a score of zero.",kidney disease
Novel grape seed extract nanoparticles attenuate amikacin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats.,"['AlyaaFarid', 'DinaMohamed', 'DinaMostafa', 'RawanTarek', 'ViolaSherif', 'GehanSafwat']","Amikacin (AMK), an antibiotic, is prescribed for treating various bacterial diseases like urinary tract infections, encephalitis, asthma and joint infections. The most significant side effects, which affect 1 to 10% of consumers, are kidney injury and ototoxicity. Several studies discussed the role of grape seed extract (GSE) in renoprotection against AMK. The current study aimed to extract Muscat of Alexandria grape seeds followed by its characterization to determine its bioactive components and elements. GSE nanoparticles was prepared and tested, in vitro, to determine its safety for the in vivo experiment. Experimental groups were control group I, AMK group II, GSE (50 mg/kg)-AMK group III, GSE (100 mg/kg)-AMK group IV, GSE NPs (25 mg/kg)-AMK group V and GSE NPs (50 mg/kg)-AMK group VI. Groups 2-6 received 100 mg/kg/day of AMK by intramuscular injection for two weeks for the induction of experimental nephrotoxicity. Groups 3-6 received daily doses of GSE or GSE NPs by oral gavage, concurrently, with AMK for two weeks. GSE was rich in polyphenol compounds like proanthocyanidins, phenolic acids like gallic and egallic acids, catechine and epicatechine. GSE NPs have a smooth surface and a size that ranged from 40 to 70 nm; and have an anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cytotoxic and anti-microbial in vitro effects. It reduced oxidative stress and inflammation that followed AMK administration; and attenuated the AMK-induced nephrotoxicity. GSE NPs were safe to be used in vivo as a renoprotective agent against AMK; where, it reduced the oxidative stress and inflammation.",kidney disease
Prevalence and mortality of ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae bloodstream infections (2018-2022).,"['MatteoBoattini', 'GabrieleBianco', 'PauloBastos', 'SaraComini', 'SilviaCorcione', 'AndréAlmeida', 'CristinaCosta', 'Francesco GiuseppeDe Rosa', 'RossanaCavallo']","Ceftazidime/avibactam-resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) is a topic of great interest for epidemiological, diagnostic, and therapeutical reasons. However, data on its prevalence and burden on mortality in patients with bloodstream infection (BSI) are lacking. This study was aimed at identifying risk factors for mortality in patients suffering from ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp BSI.
An observational retrospective study (January 2018-December 2022) was conducted at a tertiary hospital including all consecutive hospitalized adult patients with a ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp BSI. Data on baseline clinical features, management, and admission outcomes were analyzed.
Over the study period, among all the KPC-Kp BSI events recorded, 38 (10.5%) were caused by ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp strains, 37 events being finally included. The ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp strains revealed susceptibility restoration to at least one carbapenem in more than 60% of cases. In-hospital and 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 22% and 16.2%, respectively. Non-survivors suffered from more baseline comorbidities and experienced a more severe ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp BSI presentation (i.e., both the Pitt Bacteremia and INCREMENT-CPE scores were significantly higher). Presenting with a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, chronic kidney disease-KDIGO stage 3A or worse-having recently gone through renal replacement therapy, having suffered from an acute kidney injury following the ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp BSI, and being admitted for cardiac surgery were the strongest predictors of mortality.
Ceftazidime/avibactam resistance in KPC-Kp BSI easily emerged in our highly KPC-Kp endemic area with remarkable mortality rates. Our findings might provide physicians possibly actionable information when managing patients with a ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp BSI.",kidney disease

There were 6 patients with advanced CKD treated with denosumab prior to the implementation of our care pathway (March 2015-October 2020; 83% receiving dialysis). At the time of their denosumab injection, 83% were using 500-1000 mg of calcium, and 83% used 1000-2000 IU of vitamin D
A clinical care pathway focused on the safe provision of denosumab in advanced CKD reduced the risk of hypocalcemia in patients treated in our hospital. Similar pathways could be adopted and tested in other centers.",kidney disease

Imaging is a key element for successful organ-transplantation to assist surgical planning. So far, only limited data regarding the best radiological approach to prepare children for liver transplantation is available.
In an attempt to harmonize imaging surrounding pediatric liver transplantation, the European Society of Pediatric Radiology (ESPR) Abdominal Taskforce initiated a survey addressing the current status of imaging including the pre-, intra-, and postoperative phase. This paper reports the responses on preoperative imaging.
An online survey, initiated in 2021, asked European centers performing pediatric liver transplantation 44 questions about their imaging approach. In total, 26 centers were contacted and 22 institutions from 11 countries returned the survey. From 2018 to 2020, the participating centers collectively conducted 1,524 transplantations, with a median of 20 transplantations per center per annum (range, 8-60).
Most sites (64%) consider ultrasound their preferred modality to define anatomy and to plan surgery in children before liver transplantation, and additional cross-sectional imaging is only used to answer specific questions (computed tomography [CT], 90.9%; magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], 54.5%). One-third of centers (31.8%) rely primarily on CT for pre-transplant evaluation. Imaging protocols differed substantially regarding applied CT scan ranges, number of contrast phases (range 1-4 phases), and applied MRI techniques.
Diagnostic imaging is generally used in the work-up of children before liver transplantation. Substantial differences were noted regarding choice of modalities and protocols. We have identified starting points for future optimization and harmonization of the imaging approach to multicenter studies.",kidney disease
Physical Frailty Predicts Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Evaluation for Kidney Transplantation.,"['JoannaSchaenman', 'RichardAhn', 'ChristineLee', 'BethanyHale-Durbin', 'BasmahAbdalla', 'GabrielDanovitch', 'AlinaHuynh', 'RobertLaviolette', 'AhsonShigri', 'SuphamaiBunnapradist', 'ElizabethKendrick', 'Gerald SLipshutz', 'Phuong-ThuPham', 'Erik LLum', 'Julie MYabu', 'BenSeligman', 'DeenaGoldwater']","An increasing number of older patients are undergoing evaluation for kidney transplantation; however, older patients experience increased rates of complications compared with younger patients, leading to the study of frailty assessments. Although many centers have evaluated the Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP), less is known about the ability of the Short Performance Physical Battery (SPPB) to predict outcomes.
Frailty assessment by FFP and SPPB was introduced into routine outpatient evaluation for patients aged 55 years and older referred for transplantation. Transplant rate, length of stay, readmission up to 3 months posttransplant, and death were reviewed. Patients were evaluated in an initial cohort followed by a validation cohort by FFP and SPPB. Multivariate analysis correcting for demographic characteristics was applied.
Patient cohorts reflected the racial and ethnic diversity of our population, including approximately 40% Hispanic patients. The first cohort of 514 patients demonstrated a significant association between frailty as measured by SPPB and transplantation (odds ratio [OR], 2.27; 95% CI, 1.38-3.83; p = .002). The second cohort of 1408 patients validated the association between frailty measured by SPPB and transplantation (OR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.83-4.48; p < .001). In addition, there was a significant association between nonfrail status measured by SPPB and death (OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.04-0.62; p = .006).
Frailty assessment is a potentially useful approach for the assessment of transplant candidates. Our real-world study examined the performance of 2 methods of frailty evaluation methods in a diverse population, demonstrating that SPPB but not FFP was predictive of clinical outcomes. Incorporation of frailty assessments into transplant evaluation may improve risk stratification and optimize outcomes for older patients.",kidney disease

At high doses, catecholamines may impair organ perfusion. Angiotensin II is a peptide vasoconstrictor that may improve renal perfusion pressure and glomerular filtration rate, a haemodynamic profile that could reduce acute kidney injury. Angiotensin II is approved for vasodilatory shock but has not been rigorously evaluated for treatment of hypotension during liver transplantation. The objective is to assess the efficacy of angiotensin II as a second-line vasopressor infusion during liver transplantation. This trial will establish the efficacy of angiotensin II in decreasing the dose of norepinephrine to maintain adequate blood pressure. Completion of this study will allow design of a follow-up, multicentre trial powered to detect a reduction of organ injury in liver transplantation.
This is a double-blind, randomised clinical trial. Eligible subjects are adults with a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease Sodium Score ≥25 undergoing deceased donor liver transplantation.

This study aims to describe the detection rate of detectable genetic causes of fetal PRD at different levels, and novel disease-causing variants and explores genotype-phenotype correlations.
This study included 220 fetal PRD from January 2014 to June 2022. Cases were divided into three groups: isolated multicystic dysplastic kidneys (MCDK), non-isolated MCDK, and suspected polycystic kidney disease group. We reviewed data on maternal demographics, ultrasonographic results, CMA/ES results, and pregnancy outcomes.
In our cohort, CMA identified 19 (8.6%) fetuses carrying chromosomal abnormalities, and the most common CNV was 17q12 microdeletion (7/220, 3.2%). Furthermore, 94 families chose to perform trio-ES testing, and 21 fetuses (22.3%) were found to harbor P/LP variants. For PRD, there was a significant difference in the live birth rate (91/130 vs. 46/80 vs. 1/10, p < 0.001). Among 138 live birth cases, 106 (78.5%) underwent postnatal ultrasound review, of which 95 (89.6%) had a consistent prenatal-postnatal ultrasound diagnosis.
Taken together, either for isolated or non-isolated PRD, our data show high detection efficiency for both testing tools. Novel pathogenic variants have expanded the disease spectrum of PRD-associated genes while enriching the genotype-phenotype correlation. Therefore, we consider it feasible to perform CMA + ES testing in fetal PRD. Moreover, prenatal-postnatal ultrasound concordance was greater, while the live birth rate was higher and prognosis was better when known genetic disorders were excluded, showing that genetic testing results significantly influenced pregnancy decisions.",kidney disease
Chitosan nanoparticle-based in vivo delivery of miR-155 modulates the Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus-induced antiviral immune responses in zebrafish (Danio rerio).,"['T DLiyanage', 'ChamilaniNikapitiya', 'MahanamaDe Zoysa']","Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) is one of the highly pathogenic virus, which causes viral haemorrhagic septicaemia disease in both marine and freshwater fish. Micro RNA-155 (miRNA-155) is a multifunctional small non-coding RNA and it involves regulation of immune responses during viral infection. In this study, dre-miR-155 mimics were encapsulated into chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs). Resulted encapsulated product (miR-155-CNPs) was investigated for its immunomodulation role in zebrafish during experimentally challenged VHSV infection. Successful encapsulation of dre-miR-155 mimics into CNPs was confirmed through average nanoparticle (NPs) size (341.45 ± 10.00 nm), increased encapsulation efficiency percentage (98.80 %), bound dre-miR-155 with chitosan, sustained release in vitro (up to 40 %), and the integrity of RNA. Overexpressed miR-155 was observed in gills, muscle, and kidney tissues (5.42, 19.62, and 140.72-folds, respectively) after intraperitoneal delivery of miR-155-CNPs into zebrafish upon VHSV infection (miR-155-CNPs + VHSV). The miR-155-CNPs + VHSV infected fish had the highest cumulative survival (85 %), which was associated with low viral copy numbers. The miR-155-overexpressing fish showed significantly decreased expression of ifnγ, irf2bpl, irf9, socs1a, il10, and caspase3, compared to that of the miR-155 inhibitor + VHSV infected fish group. In contrast, il1β, tnfα, il6, cd8a, and p53 expressions were upregulated in miR-155-overexpressed zebrafish compared to that of the control. The overall findings indicate the successful delivery of dre-miR-155 through miR-155-CNPs that enabled restriction of VHSV infection in zebrafish presumably by modulating immune gene expression.",kidney disease

Effects of total flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) on the treatment of diabetic nephropathy via the activation of solute carriers in renal tubular epithelial cells.,"['HongmeiYu', 'HaitaoTang', 'MeiWang', 'QingXu', 'JinshiYu', 'HaitaoGe', 'LeiQiang', 'WeiTang', 'Harvest FGu']","As a traditional Chinese medicine, Huangkui capsule (HKC) has been used to treat patients with kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy (DN). We have recently demonstrated that HKC could re-regulate the activities of solute carriers (SLC)s in proximal and distal convoluted tubules of kidneys in regression of the development of DN. The main active chemical constituents of HKC are the flavones of Abelmoschus manihot (L.). The current study aims to further evaluate the efficacy of total flavones of A. manihot (TFA) in the regression of DN by analyzing SLC activities in proximal and distal convoluted tubules of kidneys. TFA (0.076 g/kg/d) or vehicle was administered in db/db mice, the animal model of type 2 diabetes and DN, daily via oral gavage for four weeks. Blood glucose levels and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured and used for the determination of T2D and DN. Ten SLCs, including slc2a2, slc4A1, slc5a2, slc5A3, slc5a8, slc6a20, slc27a2, slc12a3, slc34a1 and slc38a2 were highly expressed in proximal and distinct convoluted tubules of kidneys. Their expression at mRNA and protein levels before and after TFA treatment were analyzed with real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Data showed that UACR in the db/db mice after TFA treatment was significantly decreased. Compared with the group of non-diabetic control, slc2a2, slc4A1, slc5a2, slc5A3, slc5a8, slc6a20, slc27a2, slc12a3, slc34a1 and slc38a2 in the group of DN were down-regulated but up-regulated after TFA treatment. Further analyses of whole kidney sections indicated that the numbers and structures of the nephron in db/db mice was increased and improved after TFA treatment. Thereby, the current study provides further evidence that the flavones in A. manihot have pharmacological effects on the treatment of DN by improving the biological function of SLCs in kidneys.",kidney disease
Mechanism of peroxidasin inactivation in hyperglycemia: Heme damage by reactive oxygen species.,"['Sergey VIvanov', 'Kristie LRose', 'SeleneColon', 'Billy GHudson', 'GautamBhave', 'PaulVoziyan']","Diabetic complications present a serious health problem. Functional damage to proteins due to post-translational modifications by glycoxidation reactions is a known factor contributing to pathology. Extracellular proteins are especially vulnerable to diabetic damage because robust antioxidant defenses are lacking outside the cell. We investigated glucose-induced inactivation of peroxidasin (PXDN), a heme protein catalyzing sulfilimine crosslinking of collagen IV that reinforce the basement membranes (BM). Experiments using physiological diabetic glucose levels were carried out to exclude several potential mechanisms of PXDN inactivation i.e., direct adduction of glucose, reactive carbonyl damage, steric hindrance, and osmotic stress. Further experiments established that PXDN activity was inhibited via heme degradation by reactive oxygen species. Activity of another extracellular heme protein, myeloperoxidase, was unaffected by glucose because its heme was resistant to glucose-induced oxidative degradation. Our findings point to specific mechanisms which may compromise BM structure and stability in diabetes and suggest potential modes of protection.",kidney disease

"Circulating Activin A, Kidney Fibrosis, and Adverse Events.","['Ming-TsunTsai', 'Shuo-MingOu', 'Kuo-HuaLee', 'Chih-ChingLin', 'Szu-YuanLi']","Identification of reliable biomarkers to assess kidney fibrosis severity is necessary for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Activin A, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, has been suggested as a biomarker for kidney fibrosis. However, its precise utility in this regard remains to be established.
We investigated the correlation between plasma activin A levels, kidney fibrosis severity, and the incidence of major adverse kidney events (MAKE) in patients who underwent native kidney biopsies at a tertiary medical center. We performed RNA-sequencing and histological analyses on kidney biopsy specimens to assess activin A expression. In vitro experiments were also conducted to explore the potential attenuation of TGF-β-induced fibroblast activation through activin A inhibition.
A total of 339 patients with biopsy-confirmed kidney diseases were enrolled. Baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 36 mL/min/1.73 m2, and the urine protein/creatinine ratio was 2.9 mg/mg. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between plasma activin A levels and the extent of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Our RNA-sequencing data demonstrated a positive correlation between kidney INHBA expression and plasma activin A levels. Furthermore, the histological analysis showed that myofibroblasts were the primary activin A-positive interstitial cells in diseased kidneys. During a median follow-up of 22 months, 113 participants experienced MAKE. Cox proportional hazards analysis initially found a positive association between plasma activin A levels and kidney event risk, but it became insignificant after adjusting for confounders. In cultured fibroblasts, knockdown of activin A significantly attenuated TGF-β-induced fibroblast-myofibroblast conversion.
Plasma activin A levels correlate with kidney fibrosis severity and adverse outcomes in various kidney disorders.",kidney disease
Underlying Mechanisms and Treatment of Hypertension in Glomerular Diseases.,"['Sahar HKoubar', 'AlejandroGarcia-Rivera', 'Muner M BMohamed', 'John EHall', 'Michael EHall', 'MohamedHassanein']","This review aims to explore the underlying mechanisms that lead to hypertension in glomerular diseases and the advancements in treatment strategies and to provide clinicians with valuable insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms and evidence-based therapeutic approaches for managing hypertension in patients with glomerular diseases.
In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in our understanding of the immune and non-immune mechanisms that are involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in glomerular diseases. Furthermore, this review will encompass the latest data on management strategies, including RAAS inhibition, endothelin receptor blockers, SGLT2 inhibitors, and immune-based therapies. Hypertension (HTN) and cardiovascular diseases are leading causes of mortality in glomerular diseases. The latter are intricately related with hypertension and share common pathophysiological mechanisms. Hypertension in glomerular disease represents a complex and multifaceted interplay between kidney dysfunction, immune-mediated, and non-immune-mediated pathology. Understanding the complex mechanisms involved in this relationship has evolved significantly over the years, shedding light on the pathophysiological processes underlying the development and progression of glomerular disease-associated HTN, and is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies and improving patients' outcomes.",kidney disease
24-h urine collection in patients with urolithiasis: perspective on renal function.,"['Hyung WookKim', 'Seung-JuLee', 'Dong SupLee']","A prospective observational study involving consecutive patients diagnosed with symptomatic urolithiasis was conducted to evaluate the serial change of urinary protein and 24-h urine chemistry with time after surgical procedures for urolithiasis. A consecutive 24-h urine samples, including calcium, uric acid and citrate were collected before surgical treatments, 4 ~ 8 weeks after surgery and 6 months after surgery. The urinary protein to creatinine ratio was also repeated at each timepoint. Forty-seven patients completed the study. The quantity of 24-h urine chemistry, including calcium, uric acid and citrate, changed over time and tended to increase (p = 0.013, 0.076 and 0.004, respectively), but the changes were not prominent during short-term follow-up. In contrast, the urinary protein to creatinine ratio decreased (p < 0.001) after surgical treatment for symptomatic renal stones, and the change was reflected in short-term follow-up. However, the serial changes in the urinary protein to creatinine ratio were significantly related to the serial changes in the 24-h urinary chemistry (p < 0.001). Surgical decompression for symptomatic urolithiasis could decrease the urinary protein to creatinine ratio, indicating improvement from renal damage, which may be reflected in the increase in 24-h urinary chemistry, including calcium, uric acid and citrate. These results strengthen the previous guidelines for the timing of 24-h urine collection and provide new insight into the optimal timing from the perspective of renal function.",kidney disease
Financial Hardship and Age-Related Decrements in Kidney Function among Black and White Adults in the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) Study.,"['AgusSurachman', 'MeeraHarhay', 'Alexis RSantos', 'JonathanDaw', 'Lacy MAlexander', 'David MAlmeida', 'Christopher LCoe']","This analysis examined if financial hardship was associated with age-related decrements in kidney function using a material-psychosocial-behavioral framework. We also tested if this association was mediated by comorbidity of cardiometabolic risk factors (obesity, elevated blood pressure, and insulin resistance).
Data from 1,361 Non-Hispanic (NH) Black and white adults (ages 26-94; NH Black = 258) were obtained from the Wave 3 and Refresher phases of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) project. Kidney function was based on serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD-EPI formula without race adjustment). Financial hardship was evaluated in three domains: material (income to poverty line ratio, health insurance coverage, and public/government financial assistance), psychological (perceived financial status, control over financial status, and perceived financial strains), and behavioral responses (financial adjustment/coping such as sold possessions and cutting back on spending).
More severe financial hardship (overall score and in each domain) was associated with age-related decrements in eGFR, even after adjusting for sociodemographic, education, and health-related covariates. The association between financial hardship and age-related decrements in eGFR was conditional on sex but not race. Finally, cardiometabolic risk factors mediated the association between financial hardship and age-related decrements in eGFR.
These findings affirm the negative effects of financial hardship on age-related decrements in renal clearance. In addition to incorporating traditionally used indicators of SES, such as education and income, future research on social hallmarks of aging should also consider the role of financial hardship on the aging process and age-related diseases.",kidney disease
Technical Refinement of a Bilateral Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Mouse Model for Acute Kidney Injury Research.,"['Hui-ChunKu', 'Cheng-WeiHuang', 'Shih YiLee']","Cardiac arrest poses a large public health burden. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an adverse marker in survivors of cardiac arrest following the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Conversely, recovery of kidney function from AKI is a predictor of favorable neurological outcomes and hospital discharge. However, an effective intervention to prevent kidney damage caused by cardiac arrest after ROSC is lacking, suggesting that additional therapeutic strategies are required. Renal hypoperfusion and reperfusion are two pathophysiological mechanisms that cause AKI after cardiac arrest. Animal models of ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI (IR-AKI) of both kidneys are comparable with patients with AKI following ROSC in a clinical setting. However, IR-AKI of both kidneys is technically challenging to analyze because the model is associated with high mortality and wide variation in kidney damage, which may affect the analysis. Lightweight mice were chosen, placed under general anesthesia with isoflurane, subjected to surgery with a dorsolateral approach, and their body temperature maintained during operation, thereby reducing tissue damage and establishing a reproducible acute renal IR-AKI research protocol.",kidney disease
Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma Predominantly Composed of Anaplastic Cells: A Frequently Misdiagnosed and Highly Aggressive Variant.,"['YujiaZhong', 'JianlanXie', 'JierongChen', 'LiqinPing', 'ShengbingZang', 'YingchunZhang', 'YanfenFeng', 'YuhuaHuang']","Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL) is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with the Epstein-Barr virus that primarily affects individuals in East Asia and indigenous populations in Central and South America. Morphologically, ENKTL typically consists of medium-sized cells or a combination of small and large cells. This report presents 10 cases characterized by predominantly anaplastic cells with diffuse expression of CD30, resembling anaplastic lymphoma kinase-negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALK-negative ALCL) and demonstrating highly aggressive behavior. The cohort included 9 males and 1 female, ranging in age from 29 to 65 years (median age: 47 y). Eight patients presented with nasal disease, while 2 had non-nasal disease. Five patients had stage I/II disease, and the remaining 5 had stage III/IV disease. Morphologically, necrosis was observed in 9 cases, angiocentric-angiodestructive growth in 3 cases, and pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia in 2 cases. Anaplastic cells predominated in all cases, with some displaying eccentric, horseshoe-shaped, or kidney-shaped nuclei (referred to as ""Hallmark"" cells). The morphology profile was monomorphic in 3 cases and polymorphic in 7 cases. Immunohistochemically, all cases tested positive for cytotoxic granule markers (TIA1 and granzymeB) and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA. Cytoplasmic expression of CD3ε and CD56 was observed in 9 of 10 cases. Interestingly, most cases (7 of 8) exhibited variable expression of MuM1, ranging from 10% to 90%. All cases showed diffuse positivity for CD30 but were negative for ALK, resulting in 3 cases being initially misdiagnosed as ALK-negative ALCL. Compared with nonanaplastic cases, anaplastic cells predominant ENKTL had a significantly higher frequency of ""B"" symptoms, bone marrow involvement, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and higher Ki67 proliferative index. These findings provide valuable information for pathologists, expanding their understanding of the cytologic spectrum of ENKTL. This rare variant of ENKTL, characterized by the predominance of anaplastic cells and diffuse CD30 expression, exhibits high aggressiveness and should be differentiated from ALK-negative ALCL. Awareness of this uncommon variant is crucial in preventing misdiagnosis and ensuring the timely initiation of therapy.",kidney disease
Aberrant centrosome biogenesis disrupts nephron and collecting duct progenitor growth and fate resulting in fibrocystic kidney disease.,"['TaoCheng', 'ChideraAgwu', 'KyuhwanShim', 'BaolinWang', 'SanjayJain', 'Moe RMahjoub']","Mutations that disrupt centrosome biogenesis or function cause congenital kidney developmental defects and fibrocystic pathologies. Yet, how centrosome dysfunction results in the kidney disease phenotypes remains unknown. Here, we examined the consequences of conditional knockout of the ciliopathy gene Cep120, essential for centrosome duplication, in the nephron and collecting duct progenitor niches of the mouse embryonic kidney. Cep120 loss led to reduced abundance of both cap mesenchyme and ureteric bud populations, due to a combination of delayed mitosis, increased apoptosis, and premature differentiation of progenitor cells. These defects resulted in dysplastic kidneys at birth, which rapidly formed cysts, displayed increased interstitial fibrosis, and decline in kidney function. RNA sequencing of embryonic and postnatal kidneys from Cep120-null mice identified changes in pathways essential for development, fibrosis, and cystogenesis. Our study defines the cellular and developmental defects caused by centrosome dysfunction during kidney morphogenesis, and identifies new therapeutic targets for patients with renal centrosomopathies.",kidney disease
Neutrophil Elastase Inhibition by Sivelestat (ONO-5046) Attenuates AngII-induced Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms in Apolipoprotein E-Deficient Mice.,"['YoshikoHada', 'Haruhito AUchida', 'ShugoOkamoto', 'NozomuOtaka', 'KatsuyoshiKatayama', 'VenkateswaranSubramanian', 'AlanDaugherty', 'JunWada']","Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an arterial disease characterized by dilatation of the aortic wall. It has been suggested that neutrophil counts and neutrophil elastase activity are associated with AAA. We investigated whether a neutrophil elastase (NE) inhibitor, sivelestat (Siv), had a protective effect against angiotensin II (AngII)-induced AAAs.
Male apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were assigned into 3 groups: Vehicle+saline, AngII+saline, and AngII+Siv. All mice were administered intraperitoneally with either Siv or vehicle twice daily after AngII infusion.
In the 4-week AngII infusion study, plasma NE concentration (p=0.041) and its activity (p=0.011) were elevated by AngII. These increases were attenuated by Siv (concentration:p=0.010, activity:p=0.027). Further, plasma elastase activity was closely correlated with aortic width (R=0.6976, p<0.001). In the 1-week AngII infusion study, plasma and tissue elastase activity increased by AngII (plasma:p=0.034, tissue:p<0.001), but were reduced by Siv (plasma:p=0.014, tissue:p=0.024). AngII increased aortic width (p=0.011) but was attenuated by co-administration of Siv (p=0.022). Moreover, Siv decreased the incidence of AAAs (p=0.009). Elastin fragmentation induced by AngII was reduced by Siv. Many inflammatory cells that were either CD68 or Gr-1 positive were observed in the AngII+saline group, whereas few inflammatory cells were accumulated in the AngII+Siv group. MMP-2 and MMP-9 were enhanced by AngII, but were reduced by Siv. In vitro, MMP-2 activity was induced by human NE (medium:p<0.001, cells:p=0.001), which was attenuated by co-incubation of Siv in medium (p<0.001) and protein of human aortic smooth muscle cells (p=0.001).

Oral melanoma also commonly occurs in dogs with frequent distant metastasis. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy has been questioned in maxillary OSA and melanoma. A 17-year-old English Cocker Spaniel was referred with a growing mass on the right maxilla and a right lower lip mass. Osteosarcoma was diagnosed after partial maxillectomy, and the right lower lip mass was diagnosed as oral melanoma. Metronomic chemotherapy (MC) was performed, and the number of doses was tapered due to side effects at 5 weeks after initiation of MC. After 130 weeks of MC, chemotherapy was suspended due to kidney disease. After the suspension of chemotherapy, findings suggesting recurrence and metastasis were detected. The dog suddenly died 193 weeks after surgery, which was 8-14 times longer than the expected survival time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of successful long-term combination therapy, including surgery and MC, in a dog with maxillary OSA and lip melanoma.

Perioperative management of a severely thrombocytopenic kidney transplant recipient using thromboelastography.,"['Bir BalBaj', 'Vipin KumarGoyal', 'PraveenkumarShekhrajka', 'Ganesh RamajiNimje', 'SaurabhMittal']","Perioperative transfusion of blood and blood products can be avoided or reduced with bedside real time monitoring of coagulation in patients at risk. Thromboelastography (TEG), is a point of care coagulation monitor to assess dynamic progress of clot formation. We report a case of 26 years old female patient with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who underwent living donor kidney transplantation at our institute. On preoperative work-up, her complete blood count revealed severe thrombocytopenia. Etiology of thrombocytopenia could not be established except past history of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets syndrome in her last pregnancy. Perioperative transfusion of blood and blood products was guided with TEG and transplant was conducted successfully without any transfusion. In conclusion, severe thrombocytopenia in patients with ESKD enhances the risk of perioperative bleeding and related complications in already compromised coagulation system.

HIF-1α promotes kidney organoid vascularization and applications in disease modeling.,"['KexinPeng', 'WanqinXie', 'TingtingWang', 'YameiLi', 'Jeande Dieu Habimana', 'Obed BoadiAmissah', 'JufangHuang', 'YongChen', 'BinNi', 'ZhiyuanLi']","Kidney organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (HiPSCs) hold huge applications for drug screening, disease modeling, and cell transplanting therapy. However, these applications are limited since kidney organoid cannot maintain complete morphology and function like human kidney. Kidney organoids are not well differentiated since the core of the organoid lacked oxygen, nutrition, and vasculature, which creates essential niches. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1α) serves as a critical regulator in vascularization and cell survival under hypoxia environment. Less is known about the role of HIF-1α in kidney organoids in this regard. This study tried to investigate the effect of HIF-1α in kidney organoid vascularization and related disease modeling.
For the vascularization study, kidney organoids were generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We overexpressed HIF-1α via plasmid transfection or treated DMOG (Dimethyloxallyl Glycine, an agent for HIF-1α stabilization and accumulation) in kidney progenitor cells to detect the endothelium. For the disease modeling study, we treated kidney organoid with cisplatin under hypoxia environment, with additional HIF-1α transfection.
HIF-1α overexpression elicited kidney organoid vascularization. The endothelial cells and angiotool analysis parameters were increased in HIF-1α plasmid-transfected and DMOG-treated organoids. These angiogenesis processes were partially blocked by VEGFR inhibitors, semaxanib or axitinib. Cisplatin-induced kidney injury (Cleaved caspase 3) was protected by HIF-1α through the upregulation of CD31 and SOD2.
We demonstrated that HIF-1α elicited the process of kidney organoid vascularization and protected against cisplatin-induced kidney organoid injury in hypoxia environment.",kidney disease

A single-center retrospective observational study was conducted at King Fahad Hospital of the University, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. Hospitalized patients with confirmed central line-associated bloodstream infections between January 2015 and December 2020 were included. The primary objectives were to investigate the trends in antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the causative agents, coexisting comorbid conditions, and other risk factors associated with mortality.
A total of 214 patients with confirmed central line-associated bloodstream infections were included (CLABSI). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 33.6%. The infection rates per 1000 central line days for medical, surgical, and pediatric intensive care units were 4.97, 2.99, and 4.56 per 1000 CL days, respectively. The overall microbiological trends showed a predominance of Gram-negative agents, a steady increase of fungal CLABSI up to 24.0% in 2020, and a high prevalence of multidrug resistance up to 47% of bacterial CLABSI. In addition, the study indicates a significant negative surviving correlation with diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, chronic kidney disease, and the presence of ≥ 3 comorbidities (P < 0.05).
The microbiological trends of the study population demonstrated a steady increase of CLABSI caused by Candida spp. with a predominance of Gram-negative pathogens.

Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, we describe the changes in CKD-T2D burden and its influencing factors in the population aged 20-59 years from 1990 to 2019. Globally, the incidence, death, and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) rate of CKD-T2D showed an upward trend and increased with age, and the burden in males was higher than that in females. Population growth and aging were important driving factors for the increase of CKD-T2D DALY burden, while high systolic blood pressure and high body-mass index were the primary attributable risk factors. High body-mass index exhibited higher contributions to high Socioeconomic Development Index (SDI) countries, whereas low SDI countries were more impacted by high systolic blood pressure. The population attributable fraction of CKD-T2D DALY caused by high body-mass index was positively correlated with SDI, while high temperature and lead exposure were negatively correlated. Therefore, strengthening disease screening for people aged 20-59 years and formulating early intervention measures based on the level of socioeconomic development may effectively alleviate the burden of CKD-T2D.",kidney disease

Nutrition Management for Chronic Kidney Disease: Differences and Special Needs for Children and Adults.,"['Robert HMak', 'ArpanaIyengar', 'Angela Yee-MoonWang']","Common goals of nutritional therapy across the spectrum of pediatric and adult chronic kidney disease (CKD) include maintaining normal body mass and composition and reducing associated morbidity and mortality. Adult nephrologists caring for children and adolescents may be challenged by the existing complexities in identifying and interpreting the nutritional status and growth in children. Pediatric nephrologists may face situations that call for a sound knowledge of assessing nutritional status and providing nutrition therapy for adolescents and young adults. One important additional nutrition goal in children is to achieve normal growth and development. Children are growing and therefore need more calories and nutrients than just maintaining their body weight and composition. Lack of weight and height gain actually is considered failure to thrive in children. Some fundamental differences in approaches to nutritional therapy in CKD are necessitated based on the etiology of CKD. A large proportion of adults with CKD are diabetics, so the approach would be a low-carbohydrate diet. Children with CKD, especially young ones, often are anorexic, so calorie supplements that could include quite a lot of carbohydrates often are prescribed. More adults with CKD have hypertension and atherosclerotic comorbidities, which result in recommendations for low-salt and low-fat diets. Children with CKD often have salt and electrolyte wasting disease states and would require normal- or even high-salt diets, and fats often are included in supplements to bolster calorie intake. Low-protein diets often are recommended in adults with predialysis CKD to slow disease progression. Children are growing and have a higher protein daily requirement. Low-protein diets have not been found to be efficacious in children with CKD, in achieving normal growth, or in slowing disease progression. Adult nephrologists caring for children and adolescents may be challenged by the existing complexities in identifying and interpreting nutritional status and growth in children. Pediatric nephrologists may face situations that call for a sound knowledge of assessing nutritional status and providing nutrition therapy for adolescents and young adults.

Rapid decline of kidney function increases fracture risk in the general population: Insights from TLGS.,"['SoroushMasrouri', 'FarzadEsmaeili', 'MaryamTohidi', 'FereidounAzizi', 'FarzadHadaegh']","Although the association between Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and all-cause fractures was addressed in previous studies, the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline and fractures was poorly addressed. For the first time we examined the association between rapid kidney function decline (RKFD) and fracture incidence among Iranian general population.
In a Tehranian community-based cohort, RKFD was defined as a 30 % decline in eGFR over 2-3 years. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age, sex, current eGFR, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, obesity status, waist circumference, prevalent cardiovascular diseases, aspirin, steroid use, education level, and marital status, were used to examine the association of RKFD with different fracture outcomes.
Among 5305 (3031 women) individuals aged ≥30 years, during the median follow-up of 9.62 years, 226 fracture events were observed. The multivariable hazard ratio of RKFD for any-fracture events, lower-extremity, and major osteoporotic fractures were 2.18 (95 % CI, 1.24-3.85), 2.32 (1.15-4.71), and 2.91 (1.29-6.58), respectively. These associations remained significant after accounting for the competing risk of death. The impact of RKFD on the development of incident all-cause fractures was not modified by gender [men: 2.64 (1.11-6.25) vs. women: 2.11 (1.00-4.47)] and according to current CKD status [without CKD: 2.34 (1.00-5.52) vs. with CKD: 2.59 (1.04-6.44)] (all P for interaction >0.5).
RKFD can increase the incidence of fractures among general population, the issue that was equally important among non-CKD individuals, emphasizing the need for early identification and management in those with rapidly declining eGFR.",kidney disease
Platelet membrane-coated bio-nanoparticles of indocyanine green/elamipretide for NIR diagnosis and antioxidant therapy in acute kidney injury.,"['ShijieYao', 'DanpingWu', 'XiaojuanHu', 'YangChen', 'WeijiaoFan', 'XiaozhouMou', 'YuCai', 'XianghongYang']","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a prevalent condition in critically ill patients that is often associated with significant morbidity and mortality. As the lack of effective early diagnosis methods often delays AKI treatment, there is currently no definitive clinical intervention available. In this study, we aimed to address these challenges by developing a nano-system called Platelet membranes-ICG-SS31-PLGA (PISP), which was designed to selectively target to the kidney site, taking advantage of the natural tendency of platelets to accumulate at sites of vascular injury. This approach allowed for the accumulation of PISP within the kidney as the disease progresses. By incorporating ICG, the in vivo distribution of PISP can be observed for NIR diagnosis of AKI. This non-invasive imaging technique holds great promise for early detection and monitoring of AKI. Furthermore, Elamipretide (SS31) acts as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that protects against mitochondrial damage and reduces oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. The combination of diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities within a single nano-system makes the PISP approach a valuable tool for addressing AKI. This intervention helps to prevent the deterioration of AKI and promotes the recovery. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE.",kidney disease
HIF-1α: A potential therapeutic opportunity in renal fibrosis.,"['DishengLiu', 'LuWang', 'WuhuaHa', 'KanLi', 'RongShen', 'DeguiWang']","Renal fibrosis is a common outcome of various renal injuries, leading to structural destruction and functional decline of the kidney, and is also a critical prognostic indicator and determinant in renal diseases therapy. Hypoxia is induced in different stress and injuries in kidney, and the hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) are activated in the context of hypoxia in response and regulation the hypoxia in time. Under stress and hypoxia conditions, HIF-1α increases rapidly and regulates intracellular energy metabolism, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation. Through reprogramming cellular metabolism, HIF-1α can directly or indirectly induce abnormal accumulation of metabolites, changes in cellular epigenetic modifications, and activation of fibrotic signals. HIF-1α protein expression and activity are regulated by various posttranslational modifications. The drugs targeting HIF-1α can regulate the downstream cascade signals by inhibiting HIF-1α activity or promoting its degradation. As the renal fibrosis is affected by renal diseases, different diseases may trigger different mechanisms which will affect the therapy effect. Therefore, comprehensive analysis of the role and contribution of HIF-1α in occurrence and progression of renal fibrosis, and determination the appropriate intervention time of HIF-1α in the process of renal fibrosis are important ideas to explore effective treatment strategies.

The association between dapagliflozin use and the risk of post contrast acute kidney injury in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a propensity-matched analysis.,"['TaoLiu', 'XinwenJian', 'LiLi', 'ShanChu', 'ZeyuanFan']","Introduction This study aimed to investigate the effect of dapagliflozin in preventing post contrast acute kidney injury (PC-AKI) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who underwent an elective coronary procedure. Methods Data of patients with T2DM and CKD undergoing an elective coronary procedure at Civil Aviation General Hospital from October 2020 to April 2023, were collected from the electronic medical records. Based on dapagliflozin usage, patients were classified as dapagliflozin users and non-users. 1:1 nearest-neighbor propensity matching was performed to compare dapagliflozin users with non-users. The primary endpoint was the first PC-AKI observed. Univariate and multivariate COX regression models were used to determine the independent risk/preventive factors for PC-AKI. Thereafter, subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the interaction between subgroup and dapagliflozin usage. Changes in the serum creatinine (SCr) and cystatin C (CysC) levels were monitored at 24h, 48h and 72h after the procedure. Results 256 pairs (256 dapagliflozin users in the dapagliflozin group and 256 dapagliflozin non-users in the control group) were identified in the cohort. The incidence of PC-AKI in dapagliflozin group (10.9%) was lower than that in control group (22.3%). COX regression analyses showed that dapagliflozin use was associated with a lower risk of PC-AKI (HR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.95, P=0.01) after adjustment for covariates. In the subgroup analyses, similar HRs of the dapagliflozin usage on the PC-AKI outcome were observed in patients across different patients' characteristics which revealed its consistent benefit of preventing PC-AKI. The eGFR levels at post-48h and 72h were significant higher in the dapagliflozin group than those in the control group, while levels of SCr (post-48h and 72h) and CysC (post-24h and 48h) in the dapagliflozin group were lower compared with the control group. Conclusion Our findings suggest dapagliflozin effectively decrease PC-AKI risk and exert reno-protective effects in patients with T2DM and CKD undergoing an elective coronary procedure.",kidney disease
Effects and mechanisms of frehmaglutin D and rehmaionoside C improve LPS-induced acute kidney injury through the estrogen receptor-mediated TLR4 pathway in vivo and in vitro.,"['MengLiu', 'PengliGuo', 'MengnanZeng', 'YuhanZhang', 'JufangJia', 'YanlingLiu', 'XuChen', 'HaixueKuang', 'WeishengFeng', 'XiaokeZheng']","Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (S-AKI) is an inflammatory disease with sex differences and there has no effective drugs to cure it. Frehmaglutin D (Fre D) and rehmaionoside C (Reh C) are two violetone compounds with estrogenic activity isolated from Rehmannia glutinosa. However, whether these two drugs exert protective effects on S-AKI through their estrogen-like activity are unclear.
This study aimed to explore the effects and mechanisms of Fre D and Reh C on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced S-AKI through the estrogen receptor pathway in vivo and in vitro and to explore the interaction between ER and TLR4 for the first time.
The LPS-induced female BALB/c mice S-AKI mouse model was established by adding the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI182,780. Renal function, inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, immune cells, and expression of key proteins of the ER-TLR4-IL-1β pathway were tested. The affinity of Fre D and Reh C for the ER was investigated by molecular docking. Then, an in vitro S-AKI model was established, and ERα/ERβ antagonists (MPP/PHTPP) were added and combined with gene overexpression techniques. The interaction between ER and TLR4 was further explored by Co-IP, GST pull-down and SPR techniques.
Fre D and Reh C ameliorated LPS-induced renal damage, inflammation in mice, regulated the immune cells, decreased ROS levels, increased ERα and ERβ protein expression, and decreased TLR4, caspase 11 and IL-1β protein expression. These effects were blocked by ICI182,780. Molecular docking results showed that Fre D and Reh C bound ERα and ERβ with similar potency. The results of in vitro suggested that Fre D and Reh C reduced the levels of inflammation, ROS and apoptosis, TLR4, caspase 11, and IL-1β protein expression and increased ERα/ERβ protein expression in cells. All of these effects were reversed by the addition of MPP/PHTPP and further enhanced after ERα/ERβ gene overexpression with no significant difference in effects. Moreover, there was an indirect or direct interaction between ER and TLR4, and the binding of ERα and ERβ to TLR4 was concentration dependent.
Fre D and Reh C may improve S-AKI through the ER-TLR4-IL-1β pathway and may act on both ERα and ERβ receptors. Moreover, ERα and ERβ may interact directly or indirectly with TLR4, which was studied for the first time.",kidney disease
Developing screening tools to estimate the risk of diabetic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"['XuCao', 'XiaomeiPei']","Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is an important microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus (DM).
This study aimed to develop predictive nomograms to estimate the risk of DKD in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
The medical records of patients with T2DM in our hospital from March 2022 to March 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. The enrolled patients were randomly selected for training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. The models for predicting risk of DKD were virtualized by the nomograms using logistic regression analysis.
Among the enrolled 597 patients, 418 were assigned to the training set, while 179 were assigned to the validation set. Using the predictors included glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), presence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and duration of diabetes (DD), we constructed a full model (model 1) for predicting DKD. And using the laboratory indexes of HbA1c, HDL-C, and cystatin C (Cys-C), we developed a laboratory-based model (model 2). The C-indexes were 0.897 for model 1 and 0.867 for model 2, respectively. The calibration curves demonstrated a good agreement between prediction and observation in the two models. The decision curve analysis (DCA) curves showed that the two models achieved a net benefit across all threshold probabilities.
We successfully constructed two prediction models to evaluate the risk of DKD in patients with T2DM. The two models exhibited good predictive performance and could be recommended for DKD screening and early detection.",kidney disease
"CD72, a new immune checkpoint molecule, is a novel prognostic biomarker for kidney renal clear cell carcinoma.","['LvTian', 'YimingWang', 'ZhiyuanZhang', 'XuechaoFeng', 'FengjunXiao', 'MinruZong']","The incidence and mortality of clear cell carcinoma of the kidney increases yearly. There are limited screening methods and advances in treating kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC). It is important to find new biomarkers to screen, diagnose and predict the prognosis of KIRC. Some studies have shown that CD72 influences the development and progression of colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and acute lymphoid leukemia. However, there is a lack of research on the role of CD72 in the pathogenesis of KIRC. This study aimed to determine whether CD72 is associated with the prognosis and immune infiltration of KIRC, providing an essential molecular basis for the early non-invasive diagnosis and immunotherapy of KIRC.
Using TCGA, GTE, GEO, and ImmPort databases, we obtained the differentially expressed mRNA (DEmRNA) associated with the prognosis and immunity of KIRC patients. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to identify clinicopathological parameters associated with target gene expression. We performed univariate and multivariate COX regression analyses to determine the effect of target gene expression and clinicopathological parameters on survival. We analyzed the target genes' relevant functions and signaling pathways through enrichment analysis. Finally, the correlation of target genes with tumor immune infiltration was explored by ssGSEA and Spearman correlation analysis.
The results revealed that patients with KIRC with higher expression of CD72 have a poorer prognosis. CD72 was associated with the Pathologic T stage, Pathologic stage, Pathologic M stage, Pathologic N stage, Histologic grade in KIRC patients, Laterality, and OS event. It was an independent predictor of the overall survival of KIRC patients. Functional enrichment analysis showed that CD72 was significantly enriched in oncogenic and immune-related pathways. According to ssGSEA and Spearman correlation analysis, CD72 expression was significantly associated with tumor immune cells and immune checkpoints.
Our study suggests that CD72 is associated with tumor immunity and may be a biomarker relevant to the diagnosis and prognosis of KIRC patients.",kidney disease
ELF5 drives angiogenesis suppression though stabilizing WDTC1 in renal cell carcinoma.,"['TushuaiLi', 'LongjiangXu', 'ZheWei', 'ShaomeiZhang', 'XingyuLiu', 'YanziYang', 'YueGu', 'JieZhang']","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common malignant tumor of the urinary system. Angiogenesis is a main contributing factor for tumorigenesis. E74-like transcription factor 5 (ELF5) has been verified to participate in the progression of different cancers and can regulate angiogenesis. This study was aimed to explore the functions of ELF5 in RCC.
Bioinformatics tools were used to predict the expression of ELF5 in RCC. RT-qPCR was applied for testing ELF5 expression in RCC cells. Cell behaviors were evaluated by colony formation, CCK-8, and transwell assays. The tube formation assay was used for determining angiogenesis. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was utilized for measuring the methylation level of ELF5 in RCC cells. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays were applied for assessing the binding of ELF5 and ubiquitin-specific protease 3 (USP3). Co-IP and GST pull-down were utilized for detecting the interaction of WD40 and tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (WDTC1) and USP3. Ubiquitination level of WDTC1 was determined by ubiquitination assay.
ELF5 was lowly expressed in RCC cells and tissues. High expression of ELF5 expression notably suppressed RCC cell proliferative, migratory, and invasive capabilities, and inhibited angiogenesis. The tumor growth in mice was inhibited by ELF5 overexpression. ELF5 was highly methylated in RCC samples, and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) can promote hypermethylation level of ELF5 in RCC cells. ELF5 was further proved to transcriptionally activate USP3 in RCC. Moreover, USP3 inhibited WDTC1 ubiquitination. ELF5 can promote USP3-mediated WDTC1 stabilization. Additionally, WDTC1 silencing reversed the functions of ELF5 overexpression on RCC progression.
Downregulation of ELF5 due to DNA hypermethylation inhibits RCC development though the USP3/WDTC1axis in RCC.",kidney disease
The success rate of small renal mass core needle biopsy and its impact on lowering benign resection rate.,"['HaijuanGao', 'BehdokhtNowroozizadeh', 'Joaquin PonceZepeda', 'JaimeLandman', 'TedFarzaneh', 'CaryJohnson', 'HiradHosseini', 'MinHan']","Small renal mass (SRM) biopsy remains under-utilized due to stigma. Meanwhile, the alarmingly high benign findings in resected kidney masses highlight the need for improved preoperative diagnosis and patient selection.
The purpose of this study is to review the success rate of SRM biopsy and to evaluate its impact on patient management. A total of 168 percutaneous image-guided core needle biopsies (CNBs) of SRMs were retrieved at a tertiary academic center between 2015 and 2019. Subsequent treatment choices, side effects and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed.
The diagnostic rate of CNB was 86.9%. Benign neoplasms accounted for a significant portion (14.3%) of SRM. Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) were the most common diagnoses (69.6%) as expected. In biopsy-resection correlation, the positive predictive value of CNB was 100%. Tumor typing and subtyping by CNB were highly accurate, 100% and 98.3% respectively. Nuclear grading for clear cell RCC was accurate in 83.8% cases. The CNB results had significant impact on treatment. Most patients with RCCs underwent either resection (54.1%) or ablation (33.9%), in contrast to observation in benign neoplasms (90.5%). Most importantly, the benign resection rate (3.2%) in this series was much lower than the national average.
CNB provided accurate diagnoses for the majority of SRMs and revealed benign diagnoses in a subset of clinically suspicious lesions. Employment of CNB in suspicious SRM may help avoid overtreatment for benign lesions.",kidney disease
A rare case of a combination of ectopic kidney and medial arcuate ligament syndrome: a case report.,"['Chun-KaiHsu', 'Wen-TsangHsu', 'Wan-LingYoung', 'Shu-YuWu']","Ectopic kidney and median arcuate ligament syndrome are both rare conditions. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of these conditions are not well studied. There are no reports on the combination of these two rare conditions.
We report a 24-year-old woman with fever, dysuria, urinary frequency and left flank pain for two days. The primary diagnoses in the clinic were left acute pyelonephritis and left hydronephrosis due to throbbing pain in the left costovertebral angle and pyuria. However, further computed tomography showed right ectopic pelvic kidney, left renal pelvis dilatation without definite ureteral lesion, good bilateral renal contrast enhancement, and compression of the celiac axis due to obstruction by the median arcuate ligament. Chronic abdominal symptoms were reported by the patient after repeat history taking. The patient's condition was fully explained and discussed with her and her family, but they refused further therapy. After the acute pyelonephritis began improving, the patient was discharged for follow-up at our outpatient clinic.
We present an extremely rare case of a combination of two rare conditions: ectopic kidney and median arcuate ligament syndrome. No study to date has reported on the relationship between the two diseases. Given the rarity of the two conditions, no evidence or even a hypothesis exists to explain the possible etiology of their combination.

Integrative genome-wide analyses identify novel loci associated with kidney stones and provide insights into its genetic architecture.,"['XingjieHao', 'ZhongheShao', 'NingZhang', 'MinghuiJiang', 'XiCao', 'SiLi', 'YunlongGuan', 'ChaolongWang']","Kidney stone disease (KSD) is a complex disorder with high heritability and prevalence. We performed a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis for KSD to date, including 720,199 individuals with 17,969 cases in European population. We identified 44 susceptibility loci, including 28 novel loci. Cell type-specific analysis pinpointed the proximal tubule as the most relevant cells where susceptibility variants might act through a tissue-specific fashion. By integrating kidney-specific omics data, we prioritized 223 genes which strengthened the importance of ion homeostasis, including calcium and magnesium in stone formation, and suggested potential target drugs for the treatment. The genitourinary and digestive diseases showed stronger genetic correlations with KSD. In this study, we generate an atlas of candidate genes, tissue and cell types involved in the formation of KSD. In addition, we provide potential drug targets for KSD treatment and insights into shared regulation with other diseases.",kidney disease
Thrombospondin1 antagonist peptide treatment attenuates obesity-associated chronic inflammation and metabolic disorders in a diet-induced obese mouse model.,"['QiZhou', 'TaesikGwag', 'ShuxiaWang']","Thrombospondin1 (TSP1) is a multifunctional matricellular protein. Previously, we demonstrated that TSP1 plays a pivotal role in obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance (IR) by modulating macrophage accumulation and activation in adipose tissue. Moreover, in our in vitro studies, a CD36-derived peptide, functioning as a TSP1 antagonist, effectively inhibited TSP1-induced proinflammatory macrophage activation. However, whether this CD36 peptide can inhibit obesity-induced inflammation and IR in vivo is unknown and determined in this study in a high fat diet-induced obese mouse model (DIO). CD36 peptide or control peptide was intraperitoneally administered into the established obese mice triweekly for 6 weeks. We found that CD36 peptide treatment didn't affect obesity or weight gain but significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine production systemically and in visceral fat tissue. Adipose tissue exhibited fewer crown-like structures and reduced macrophage infiltration. CD36 peptide treatment also attenuated the proinflammatory phenotype of bone marrow derived macrophages from obese mice. Furthermore, CD36 peptide treatment improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and mitigated obesity-related fatty liver disease and kidney damage. Collectively, this study suggests that the CD36 peptide, as a TSP1 antagonist, shows promise as a novel therapeutic approach for managing obesity-related metabolic disorders.",kidney disease

Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Associations of Comorbidities with Knee Symptoms and Radiographic Abnormalities of Osteoarthritis.,"['XiaoxiLi', 'FengPan', 'RuiZhu', 'LiruGe', 'XiaoyueZhang', 'XiangruiWen', 'JiantaoZhou', 'JialeCheng', 'FamingPan', 'GuoqiCai']","This study aimed to investigate the associations of comorbidities with knee symptoms and radiographic abnormalities of osteoarthritis (OA).
Participants were from the Osteoarthritis Initiative. Comorbidities were identified at baseline using the modified Charlson Comorbidity Index. For both knees, symptoms were assessed annually from baseline to 48 months using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain and function scores (rescaled range 0-100), and radiographic abnormalities using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL, 0-4) grades. The presence of significant pain and functional disability was defined as a WOMAC score of ≥ 25 and ≥ 22, respectively, and radiographic OA (ROA) as KL ≥ 2. An increase of ≥ 9 in WOMAC scores and ≥ 1 in KL grades were defined as symptomatic and radiographic progression, respectively.
Of 3337 participants, 28% and 9% had one and ≥ 2 comorbidities, respectively. The number of comorbidities was associated with the presence of significant functional disability (odds ratios [ORs] 1.15; 1.46) and predicted the progression of both knee pain and functional disability (ORs 1.11; 1.51). For the type of comorbidities, non-OA musculoskeletal diseases were associated with the presence of ROA and significant functional disability (ORs 1.63; 1.82) and showed a trend to predict incident ROA (OR 1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.00-3.38 p = 0.051). Diabetes and kidney diseases were associated with symptomatic progression of OA (ORs 1.38; 2.72).
Having more comorbidities, especially diabetes and kidney diseases, is associated with symptomatic progression of knee OA. Moreover, non-OA musculoskeletal diseases may be associated with the presence and onset of ROA.",kidney disease

Glutamine synthetase and hepatocellular carcinoma.,"['JinghuaJiang', 'YitingHu', 'DazhangFang', 'JianShengLuo']","Glutamine synthetase (GS) is an enzyme that converts ammonia and glutamate to glutamine using adenosine triphosphate. GS is expressed in the brain, kidney, and liver tissues under normal physiological conditions. GS is involved in abnormal lipid metabolism of the liver by catalyzing de novo synthesis of glutamine, thereby inducing liver inflammation. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases (MASLD), such as Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease and Metabolic Associated Steato Hepatitis, are considered risk factors for HCC. GS may also be involved in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through other signaling pathways, including the rapamycin (mTOR) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways. Furthermore, the correct combination of HSP70, GPC3, and GS can improve the accuracy and precision of HCC diagnosis. However, the prognostic value of GS in different HCC populations remains controversial. The expression of GS affects the sensitivity of HCC cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In addition, immunotherapy has been approved for the treatment of advanced HCC. This article delves into the development and application of GS in HCC, laying a theoretical foundation for the subsequent exploration of GS as a potential target for treating HCC.",kidney disease
Battle of Polymyxin Induced Nephrotoxicity: Polymyxin B versus Colistin.,"['Fatma NisaBallı', 'Pınar BakırEkinci', 'MelekKurtaran', 'EmreKara', 'Gülçin TelliDizman', 'Meliha ÇağlaSönmezer', 'MutluHayran', 'KutayDemirkan', 'GökhanMetan']","Nephrotoxicity is the most serious and common adverse effect that limits the use of polymyxins. This study compared polymyxin E (colistin) and polymyxin B regarding drug-related nephrotoxicity.
This study was conducted as a retrospective cohort study in a university hospital between January 2020 and July 2022. Patients older than 18 years and who received colistin or polymyxin B were identified using electronic hospital records. Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome criteria were used for assessing nephrotoxicity.
A total of 190 patients, 95 in both groups, were evaluated. The incidence of acute kidney injury during the treatment was higher in the colistin group [52.6% (n=50) and 34.7% (n=33), p=0.013]. In patients who were exposed to high-dose, the rate of nephrotoxicity was higher in patients receiving colistin [25% (n=3) vs 76.9% (n=10); p=0.017]. Nephrotoxicity was reversible in 64.4% (n=38) of patients and the reversibility rate was similar (70% and 52.6% for colistin and polymyxin; p=0.248). In the multivariable analysis, colistin treatment [Odds ratio (OR): 3.882, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = (1.829-8.241)], concomitant vasopressor use (OR=2.08, CI: 1.036-4.179), and age (OR=1.036, CI: 1.014-1.058) were found to be independent markers of nephrotoxicity.
Nephrotoxicity was more common in patients receiving high dose colistin than polymyxin B. Therefore, the use of appropriate doses of colistin is important in terms of preventing nephrotoxicity. In addition, advancing age and concomitant use of vasopressors contribute to polymyxin-related nephrotoxicity.",kidney disease

Surgical management of tuberous sclerosis complex with big fat-poor bilateral renal angiomyolipomas: A case report.,"['LongZhang', 'JiayuanZeng', 'ZhilinYao']","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disease that affects multiple organs. Medical therapy with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus has become the first option in patients with angiomyolipomas. But mTOR inhibitor treatment shows no effect in some patients, in the case, surgery is a suitable method for treatment.
A 30-year-old Chinese male patient received an ultrasound examination of the kidney, which showed bilateral hyperechogenic structures without stones or ureterohydronephrosis. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the kidneys showed multiple slightly high-density masses (largest size: left 6.5 cm, right 5.2 cm), and the masses lacking of lipids were obviously enhanced in the arterial phase. To clarify the components of the tumors, we performed retroperitoneal laparoscopic tumor enucleation to remove all visible masses in left kidney. The pathological results and genetic tests confirmed the diagnosis of TSC. For reducing the further spontaneously bleeding risk and the cost burden, the right renal tumors were also enucleated. Twelve months after the second operation, renal function remained normal, and no tumors were detected by CT.
Large angiomyolipomas (>4 cm in diameter) may develop life-threatening hemorrhage or compress normal kidney tissue. Fat-poor renal angiomyolipomas are difficult for making a differential diagnosis from renal cancer or renal sarcomatoid carcinoma. When medication treatment does not work, surgery is a good option to diagnose and treat big bilateral renal angiomyolipomas.
After 12 months of follow-up, retroperitoneal laparoscopic tumor enucleation may be a safe and effective method for treating big fat-poor renal angiomyolipomas in patients with TSC.",kidney disease
Intracellular tacrolimus concentration correlates with impaired renal function through regulation of the IS-AHR-ABC transporter in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.,"['PengpengGuo', 'RuiZhang', 'JinpingZhou', 'PeixiaLi', 'YaniLiu', 'ShaojunShi']","Tacrolimus (TAC) concentration in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is regarded as a better predictor of its immunosuppressive effect than the TAC concentration in whole blood. However, whether the exposure of TAC in PBMCs or WB was altered in post-transplant recipients with renal impairment remains unclear.
We investigated the relationship of trough TAC concentration in WB and PBMCs with renal functions in post-transplant recipients. The pharmacokinetic profiles of TAC in PBMCs and WB in the two chronic kidney disease (CKD) rat models were examined using UPLC-MS/MS. Western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were used to analyze the expression of proteins and mRNAs related to TAC metabolism and transport, respectively. In addition, the effects of uremic toxins on human PBMCs were investigated using whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing [RNA-seq]).
We observed a decrease in the trough TAC concentration in PBMCs in the recipients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 90 mL/min, compared with those of recipients with eGFR > 90 mL/min, but there was no difference in blood based on TAC concentrations (C
The pharmacokinetics of TAC in PBMCs changed with a decline in renal function. Uremic toxins accumulate during renal insufficiency, which activates AHR, upregulates the expression of P-gp and MRP2, and affects their intracellular concentrations. Our findings suggest that monitoring TAC concentrations in PBMCs is more important than monitoring WB concentrations in post-transplant recipients with renal impairment.",kidney disease
Peptide NCTX15 derived from spider toxin gland effectively relieves hyperuricemia in mice.,"['YixiangLiu', 'NaixinLiu', 'WenxinBian', 'YueZhang', 'YutongWu', 'YingPeng', 'ZeqiongRu', 'ZheFu', 'YingleiWang', 'ChaoLi', 'XinwangYang', 'YingWang']","Hyperuricemia is a clinical disease characterized by a continuous increase in uric acid (UA) due to purine metabolism disorder. As current drug treatments are limited, it is imperative to explore new drugs that offer better safety and efficacy. In this study, Nephila clavata toxin gland homogenates were isolated and purified by exclusion chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, resulting in the identification and isolation of a short peptide (NCTX15) with the sequence 'QSGHTFK'. Analysis showed that NCTX15 exhibited no cytotoxicity in mouse macrophages or toxic and hemolytic activity in mice. Notably, NCTX15 inhibited UA production by down-regulating urate transporter 1 and glucose transporter 9 and up-regulating organic anion transporter 1, thus promoting UA excretion. In addition, NCTX15 alleviated the inflammatory response and renal injury by inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha, NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3, and pyroptosis-related factor gasdermin D. These results indicate that NCTX15 displayed urate-lowering, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects. As the first urate-reducing short peptide isolated from a spider toxin gland homogenate, NCTX15 exhibits considerable potential as a novel drug molecule for anti-gout and hyperuricemia treatment.",kidney disease

Patients were identified from a USA-based administrative claims database who had index cancer diagnoses of breast, lung, prostate, melanoma, myeloma, kidney, colorectal, leukemia, or lymphoma between 2011 and 2019, with continuous enrollment for ≥12 months before diagnosis. Baseline CV risk factors and incidence rates of CV events post-index were identified for each cancer. Multivariable Cox hazards models assessed the cumulative incidence of MACE, accounting for baseline risk factors.
Among 839 934 patients across nine cancer types, CV risk factors were prevalent. The cumulative incidence of MACE was highest in lung cancer and myeloma, and lowest in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. MACE cumulative incidence for lung cancer was 26% by 4 years (2.7-fold higher relative to breast cancer). The incidence of stroke was especially pronounced in lung cancer, while HF was highest in myeloma and lung cancer.
CV events were especially increased following certain cancer diagnoses, even after accounting for baseline risk factors. Understanding the variable patient characteristics and associated CV events across different cancers can help target appropriate CV risk factor modification and develop strategies to minimize adverse CV events and improve patient outcomes.",kidney disease
Regulatory networks of circRNA- centred ceRNAs in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.,"['TongtongMa', 'JunjieWu', 'ZhongqingChen']","Sepsis is the primary cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) and is associated with high mortality rates. Growing evidence suggests that noncoding RNAs are vitally involved in kidney illnesses, whereas the role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in sepsis-induced AKI (SAKI) remains largely unknown. In this present study, caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in mice was performed to establish an SAKI model. The expression of circRNAs and mRNAs was analysed using circRNA microarray or next-generation sequencing. The results revealed that the expressions of 197 circRNAs and 2509 mRNAs were dysregulated. Validation of the selected circRNAs was performed by qRT-PCR. Bioinformatics analyses and chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that NF-κB/p65 signalling induced the upregulation of circC3, circZbtb16, and circFkbp5 and their linear counterparts by p65 transcription in mouse tubular epithelial cells (mTECs). Furthermore, competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks demonstrated that some components of NF-κB signalling were potential targets of these dysregulated circRNAs. Among them, Tnf-α was increased by circFkbp5 through the downregulation of miR-760-3p in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated mTECs. Knocking down circFkbp5 inhibited the p65 phosphorylation and apoptosis in injured mTECs. These findings suggest that the selected circRNAs and the related ceRNA networks provide new knowledge into the fundamental mechanism of SAKI and circFkbp5/miR-760-3p/Tnf-α axis might be therapeutic targets.",kidney disease
How We Treat Sickle Cell Disease in Pregnancy.,"['Andra HJames', 'John JStrouse']","50 years ago, people with sickle cell disease (SCD) were discouraged from becoming pregnant, but now most should be supported if they choose to pursue a pregnancy. They and their providers, however, should be aware of the physiological changes of pregnancy that aggravate SCD and pregnancy's unique maternal and fetal challenges. Any maternal endothelial damage from a poorly perfused placenta has the potential for being superimposed on the endothelial damage of SCD. The immunological and mechanical changes of pregnancy contribute to an increased susceptibility to certain infections. Activation of the complement system and increased neutrophils may contribute to the increase in vaso-occlusive crises during pregnancy. There is an increased demand for red cell mass that is often not achievable without transfusion. Cardiac output increases by 45%. The anatomic and physiologic changes of pregnancy increase the risk of kidney injury. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state which confers an increased risk of thrombosis. Maternal problems can arise from chronic underlying organ dysfunction such as renal disease or pulmonary hypertension, from acute complications of SCD such as acute anemia, vaso-occlusive crises and acute chest syndrome, and/or from pregnancy-related complications such as preeclampsia, sepsis, severe anemia, thromboembolism and need for cesarean delivery. Fetal problems include alloimmunization, opioid exposure, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, and stillbirth. Prior to and during pregnancy, in addition to the assessment and care that every pregnant patient should receive, patients with SCD should be evaluated and treated by a multidisciplinary team with respect to their unique maternal and fetal issues.",kidney disease
AGA Clinical Practice Update on the Use of Vasoactive Drugs and Intravenous Albumin in Cirrhosis: Expert Review.,"['GuadalupeGarcia-Tsao', 'Juan GAbraldes', 'Nicole ERich', 'Vincent Wai-SunWong']","Cirrhosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and worldwide. It consists of compensated, decompensated, and further decompensated stages; median survival is more than 15 years, 2 years, and 9 months for each stage, respectively. With each stage, there is progressive worsening of portal hypertension and the vasodilatory-hyperdynamic circulatory state, resulting in a progressive decrease in effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion. Vasoconstrictors reduce portal pressure via splanchnic vasoconstriction and are used in the management of variceal hemorrhage. Intravenous (IV) albumin increases effective arterial blood volume and is used in the prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI) and death after large-volume paracentesis and in patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The combination of vasoconstrictors and albumin is used in the reversal of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI), the most lethal complication of cirrhosis. Because a potent vasoconstrictor, terlipressin, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and because recent trials have explored use of IV albumin in other settings, it was considered that a best practice update would be relevant regarding the use of vasoactive drugs and IV albumin in the following 3 specific scenarios: variceal hemorrhage, ascites and SBP, and HRS.
This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Some of the statements are unchanged from published guidelines because of lack of new evidence in the literature. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality and evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Vasoactive drugs should be initiated as soon as the diagnosis of variceal hemorrhage is suspected or confirmed, preferably before diagnostic and/or therapeutic endoscopy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: After initial endoscopic hemostasis, vasoactive drugs should be continued for 2-5 days to prevent early rebleeding. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Octreotide is the vasoactive drug of choice in the management of variceal hemorrhage based on its safety profile. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: IV albumin should be administered at the time of large-volume (>5 L) paracentesis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: IV albumin may be considered in patients with SBP. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Albumin should not be used in patients (hospitalized or not) with cirrhosis and uncomplicated ascites. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Vasoconstrictors should not be used in the management of uncomplicated ascites, after large-volume paracentesis or in patients with SBP. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: IV albumin is the volume expander of choice in hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and ascites presenting with AKI. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Vasoactive drugs (eg, terlipressin, norepinephrine, and combination of octreotide and midodrine) should be used in the treatment of HRS-AKI, but not in other forms of AKI in cirrhosis. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Terlipressin is the vasoactive drug of choice in the treatment of HRS-AKI and use of concurrent albumin can be considered when accounting for patient's volume status. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Terlipressin treatment does not require intensive care unit monitoring and can be administered intravenously through a peripheral line. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Terlipressin use is contraindicated in patients with hypoxemia and in patients with ongoing coronary, peripheral, or mesenteric ischemia, and should be used with caution in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 3. The benefits may not outweigh the risks in patients with serum creatinine >5 mg/dL and in patients listed for transplantation with a Model for End-stage Liver Disease ≥35.",kidney disease
hsa_circ_0020378 regulating miR-339-3p/COL1A1 promotes osteosarcoma progression.,"['LiangLiu', 'WenzeHuang']","Osteosarcoma is a malignant orthopedic tumor that is frequently diagnosed in the pediatric population. Several studies have summarized the functions of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the progression of osteosarcoma. This study aimed to investigate a novel circRNA, hsa_circ_0020378 (circ_0020378), and elucidate its functions and underlying mechanisms during osteosarcoma progression. The expression levels of circ_0020378, miR-339-3p, and COL1A1 in osteosarcoma cells and tissues were determined using RT-qPCR or Western blotting. CCK8, transwell migration, colony formation, and xenograft experiments were performed to assess the malignancy of osteosarcoma cells. Luciferase and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments were employed to validate the interactions of miR-339-3p with circ_0020378 and COL1A1 3'UTR. Osteosarcoma cells and tissues showed significant upregulation of circ_0020378 and COL1A1 and downregulation of miR-339-3p. Silencing circ_0020378 in osteosarcoma cells inhibited their proliferation, colony formation, and migration. The inhibitive influence of circ_0020378 silencing during osteosarcoma tumorigenesis in vitro was verified in vivo. Circ_0020378 sponged miR-339-3p which targeted COL1A1 3'UTR. Circ _0020378 silencing disrupted the tumor-promoting effect of the miR-339-3p inhibitor in osteosarcoma cells. Furthermore, miR-339-3p inhibitor attenuated the suppressive effect of COL1A1 downregulation on malignant osteosarcoma cell phenotypes. Circ_0020378 stimulates osteosarcoma progression by downregulating miR-339-3p/COL1A1 expression. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the discovery of novel osteosarcoma targets.",kidney disease

ACT001 Alleviates chronic kidney injury induced by a high-fat diet in mice through the GPR43/AMPK pathway.,"['YibingZhou', 'ZeChen', 'HuiZhou', 'BinNiu', 'JingLiu', 'YinglunLi', 'YuqiangMi', 'PingLi']","Roughly 10 -15% of global populace suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD). A major secondary disease that can progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is obesity-associated kidney disease (ORG). Although clinical management strategies are currently available, morbidity and mortality rates are increasing. Thus, new solutions are needed. Intestinal permeability, systemic inflammation, and aberrant intestinal metabolites have all been linked to ORG.
ACT001 has anti-inflammatory, redox-regulatory and antitumour activities. The current study was designed to examine how ACT001 affects ORG and analyze the fundamental processes.
A high-fat diet (HFD) was used to generate ORG in female C57BL/6 J mice. ORG mice were divided into three groups at random: HFD, HFD + ACT001, HFD + polyphosphocholine (PPC). To assess renal and colonic damage, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining were used. Following that, renal inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid deposition, colonic inflammation, and intestinal permeability were evaluated by protein blotting, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining. Lastly, the SCFAs content was assessed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry.
Mice in the HFD group displayed more severe albuminuria, glomerular hypertrophy, renal oxidative damage, inflammation, and lipid accumulation than mice with the normal diet (ND) group, as well as lower levels of intestinal SCFA valproic acid, colonic inflammation, and tight junction protein downregulation. ACT001 treatment restores the content of valproic acid in intestinal SCFAs, promotes the binding of SCFAs to renal GPR43, activates the AMPK signalling pathway. Therefore, it promotes the Nrf2-Keap1 signalling pathway and inhibits the NF-κB signalling pathway. SCFAs, additionally, augment colonic GPR43 concentrations, diminishing NLRP3 inflammasome expression and restoring ZO-1 and occludin protein levels.
This study is the first to look at ACT001's potential as a treatment for obesity-related kidney disease. Regulating GPR43 and AMPK signalling pathways, By controlling the GPR43 and AMPK signalling pathways, ACT001 improves colitis and the intestinal mucosal barrier, decreases renal lipid deposition, and suppresses inflammation and oxidative stress in the kidneys. According to this study, ACT001 could be a viable ORG therapy option.",kidney disease
"Longitudinal associations of loneliness with mental ill-health, physical ill-health, lifestyle factors and mortality in ageing adults in Thailand.","['SupaPengpid', 'KarlPeltzer', 'DararattAnantanasuwong']","The aim of this study was to assess the longitudinal association between loneliness, mental and physical ill-health indicators, lifestyle factors and mortality among middle-aged and older adults in Thailand.
We analyzed prospective cohort data of participants 45 years and older from three consecutive waves in 2015 (n = 5616), 2017 (n = 3600), and in 2020 (n = 2863) of the Health, Aging and Retirement in Thailand (HART) study. Loneliness was assessed with a single item. To assess the longitudinal associations between loneliness and health outcomes between 2015 (baseline), 2017 (first follow-up) and 2020 (second follow-up), we conducted Generalized Estimating Equations analysis (GEE).
The proportion of loneliness was 21.6% in 2015, 23.8% in 2017 and 21.3% in 2020. In the adjusted GEE logistic regression model, loneliness was positively associated with mental ill-health (poor self-rated mental health status, poor quality of life/happiness, depressive symptoms, and insomnia symptoms), physical ill-health (poor self-rated physical health status, hypertension, kidney disease, osteoporosis, and ADL disability), and lifestyle factors (physical inactivity, and having underweight). Furthermore, in adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression, loneliness was associated with mortality. In adjusted logistic regression, compared to without loneliness in all three study waves, having loneliness in one wave and/or two to three waves was positively associated with incident mental ill-health (incident poor self-rated mental health status, incident poor quality of life/happiness, incident depressive symptoms, and incident insomnia symptoms), incident physical ill-health (incident poor self-rated physical health status, incident diabetes, incident kidney disease, and incident ADL disability), and incident lifestyle factors (having incident underweight).
We found that loneliness was associated with several mental and physical ill-health indicators, lifestyle factors and mortality. Enhanced screening and treatment of loneliness may reduce mental and physical ill-health indicators in Thailand.",kidney disease
Incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury in patients with malignant tumors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"['WangCan', 'LiRong', 'LiuLixia']","There are significant differences in the incidence and risk factors of tumor patients, and there is no relevant statistical data. Therefore, this study aims to clarify the incidence and risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in malignant tumor patients and compare critically ill patients with non-critically ill patients.
Relevant literature on the occurrence of AKI in malignant tumors was retrieved from databases. Two authors independently screened and evaluated the eligibility and quality of the literature and extracted the data. The Stata 12.0 software was used for meta-analysis.
A total of 3922 articles were initially retrieved, and 24 articles were finally included, 8 of which were about critically ill malignant tumor patients, and 16 were about malignant tumor patients. Among the 4107 patients included in the 8 studies on critically ill malignant tumors, 1932 developed AKI, with an incidence rate of 52% (95%CI 34-70%, I2 = 99%). The risk factors for AKI in critically ill malignant tumor patients were sepsis and hypovolemia, which were different from those in non-critically ill patients. Among the 292,874 patients included in the 16 studies on malignant tumors, 51,211 developed AKI, and the combined incidence rate was 24% (95%CI 17-30%, I2 = 100%). The risk factors for AKI in critical malignant tumor patients were sepsis and hypovolemia.
This meta-analysis shows that the incidence of AKI in critically ill malignant tumor patients is consistent with that in other critically ill patients, and independent risk factors are sepsis and hypovolemia. The incidence of AKI in malignant tumor patients is higher than that in other patients, and tumor is a risk factor for AKI.

Different equations for estimating age-related changes of glomerular filtration rate in the healthy population.,"['LuWei', 'XueShen', 'JuanZhang', 'ZhenzhuYong', 'QunZhang', 'WeihongZhao']","Identifying age-related trend of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is necessary to assess whether kidney function is healthily aging. This study aimed to investigate the application of CKD-EPI, FAS, and Xiangya equations for the aging estimation of eGFR in the healthy Chinese individuals.
A total of 36,911 healthy individuals were enrolled in this study. We grouped every ten years to observe the trend of eGFR with aging and investigated decline rate of it by general linear regression analysis in each age-groups. Agreement between equations was determined by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman plot. We calculated reference interval in each age-group. We further analyzed above statistical indicators in males and females.
The eGFR by CKD-EPI, and Xiangya equation started to decline from the age of 18. Whereas eGFR by FAS equation remained stable under 40 years, then decreased more rapidly. Compared with males, the females had a higher level but a faster decline rate of eGFR with aging. Agreement analysis revealed good agreement between CKD-EPI and FAS equations (ICC 0.818-0.920). Agreement between Xiangya and CKD-EPI or FAS equations was poor to moderate in most of the population under 70 years old (ICC 0.282-0.786), but good in individuals above 70 years (ICC 0.769-0.881).
The trend of eGFR with aging was different by CKD-EPI, FAS, and Xiangya equations in the healthy Chinese. It may be necessary to take these equations- or age-related differences into consideration when assessing kidney function in primary health care and clinical practice.",kidney disease
Extracellular vesicles derived from different tissues attenuate cardiac dysfunction in murine MI models.,"['XuanLiu', 'ShanshanShi', 'XuediGeng', 'EnhaoWang', 'QingshuMeng', 'MimiLi', 'FangLin', 'XiaoxueMa', 'WeiHan', 'XiaohuiZhou']","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from various cell sources exert cardioprotective effects during cardiac ischemic injury. Our previous study confirmed that EVs derived from ischemic-reperfusion injured heart tissue aggravated cardiac inflammation and dysfunction. However, the role of EVs derived from normal cardiac tissue in myocardial ischemic injury remains elusive.
In the present study, normal heart-derived EVs (cEVs) and kidney-derived EVs (nEVs) were isolated and intramyocardially injected into mice after myocardial infarction (MI). We demonstrated that administration of both cEVs and nEVs significantly improved cardiac function, reduced the scar size, and alleviated inflammatory infiltration into the heart. In addition, cardiomyocyte apoptosis was inhibited, whereas angiogenesis was enhanced in the hearts receiving cEVs or nEVs treatment. Moreover, intramyocardial injection of cEVs displayed much better cardiac protective efficacy than nEVs in murine MI models. RNA-seq and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed the protective mRNA clusters in both cEVs and nEVs. These mRNAs were involved in multiple signaling pathways, which may synergistically orchestrate to prevent the heart from further damage post MI.
Collectively, our results indicated that EVs derived from normal heart tissue may represent a promising strategy for cardiac protection in ischemic heart diseases.",kidney disease
Effect of teaching health-promoting behaviors on the care burden of family caregivers of hemodialysis patients: a four-group clinical trial.,"['MehrdadHayati', 'RaziehBagherzadeh', 'MehdiMahmudpour', 'FatemehHeidari', 'HakimehVahedparast']","Chronic kidney disease could have a profound effect on the life of patients and family caregivers. The caregivers' care burden increases as the disease progresses. Interventions reducing care burden should be investigated. Educational interventions could affect family caregivers' care burden among hemodialysis patients. However, most studies and interventions have focused on caregivers. Therefore, this study aims to compare the effect of teaching Health-promoting behaviors on the care burden of family caregivers of hemodialysis patients.
This trial was conducted using a pretest-posttest design and follow-up after one month. Hemodialysis patients and their family caregivers were selected using convenience sampling method. In total, 124 patient-caregiver pairs were divided into four groups of patient-centered education, caregiver-centered education, Patient and caregiver education and control by block randomization (15 blocks of 8 members and 1 block of 4 members) (n = 31 pairs per group). The intervention (teaching health-promoting behaviors) was performed in 8 sessions using the teach-back method, except for the control. The data were collected by patient and caregiver demographic forms and Novak and Guest care burden inventory as well as following the treatment regimen in three stages (before, immediately after and one month after the intervention). Demographic variables were compared among the four groups using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis and Chi-square test. The intragroup comparison of the main variables was made using the repeated measures ANOVA with modified LSD post hoc test. The intergroup comparison was made by one-way ANOVA with LSD post hoc test.
Out of 124 caregivers participating in the study, 68 (54.8%) were female. Also, out of 124 patients participating in the study, 86 (69.4%) were male. The mean age of the caregivers and patients was 39.2 ± 11.31 and 54.23 ± 14.20 years old, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean total care burden scores of the pre-test and post-test between the four groups (p < 0.001). The total care burden decreased in patient-centered, caregiver-centered and Patient and caregiver education groups. However, this reduction in the caregiver-centered and Patient and caregiver education groups was significantly higher than the patient-centered education group (p < 0.001).
The results revealed teaching health-promoting behaviors reduced care burden. Moreover, caregiver-centered approach could reduce care burden more than patient-centered approach. Therefore, this could be used as a supportive method to improve the health of patients and caregivers.

The trajectory of a range of commonly captured symptoms with standard care in people with kidney failure receiving haemodialysis: consideration for clinical trial design.,"['Pann EiHnynn Si', 'MónicaHernández-Alava', 'LoueseDunn', 'MartinWilkie', 'JamesFotheringham']","Despite the recognized high symptom prevalence in haemodialysis population, how these symptoms change over time and its implications for clinical practice and research is poorly understood.
Prevalent haemodialysis patients in the SHAREHD trial reported 17 POS-S Renal symptoms (none, mild, moderate, severe and overwhelming) at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. To assess the prevalence change at population level in people reporting moderate or worse symptoms at baseline, the absolute change in prevalence was estimated using multi-level mixed effects probit regression adjusting for age, sex, time on haemodialysis and Charlson Comorbidity Score. To assess changes at individual level, the proportion of people changing their symptom score every 6 months was estimated.
Five hundred fifty-two participants completed 1725 questionnaires at four timepoints. Across all 17 symptoms with moderate or worse symptom severity at baseline, the majority of the change in symptom prevalence at population level occurred in the 'severe' category. The absolute improvement in prevalence of the 'severe' category was ≤ 20% over 18 months in eleven of the seventeen symptoms despite a large degree of relatively balanced movement of individuals in and out of severe category every six months. Examples include depression, skin changes and drowsiness, which had larger proportion (75-80%) moving in and out of severe category each 6 months period but < 5% difference between movement in and out of severe category resulting in relatively static prevalence over time. Meanwhile, larger changes in prevalence of > 20% were observed in six symptoms, driven by a 9 to 18% difference between movement in and movement out of severe category. All symptoms had > 50% of people in severe group changing severity within 6 months.
Changes in the severity of existing symptoms under standard care were frequent, often occurring within six months. Certain symptoms exhibited clinically meaningful shifts at both the population and individual levels. This highlighted the need to consider improvements in symptom severity when determining sample size and statistical power for trials. By accounting for potential symptom improvements with routine care, researchers can design trials capable of robustly detecting genuine treatment effects, distinguishing them from spontaneous changes associated with standard haemodialysis.",kidney disease

Its prognosis strongly relies on early diagnosis and treatment by cysteamine. Developing economies (DEing) face many challenges when treating patients for rare and chronic diseases. The aim here is to evaluate the access to investigations and treatment in DEing, and to assess for potential inequalities with Developed Economies (DEed).
In this international cross-sectional study, a questionnaire on access, price and reimbursement of genetic, biological analyses, and treatment was sent to nephrology centers worldwide during 2022.
A total of 109 centers responded, coming from 49 countries and managing 741 patients: 43 centers from 30 DEing and Economies in transition (TrE), and 66 from 19 DEed. In 2022, genetics availability was 63% in DEing and 100% in DEed, whereas intra leukocytes cystine levels (IL-CL) were available for 30% of DEing patients, and 94% of DEed patients, both increasing over the last decade, as has access to immediate release cysteamine and to cysteamine eye drops in DEing. However, delayed released cysteamine can be delivered to only 7% vs. 74% of patients from DEing and DEed, respectively, and is still poorly reimbursed in DEing.
Over the last decade, access to investigations (namely genetics and IL-CL) and to cysteamine have improved in DEing and TrE. However, discrepancies remain with DEed: access to delayed released cysteamine is limited, and reimbursement is still profoundly insufficient, therefore limiting their current use.

Comparison of the effect of surgical versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement on the development of postoperative acute kidney injury.,"['TakaomiNomi', 'AkiraKitamura', 'MikiTsujita', 'YukiShiko', 'YoheiKawasaki', 'HideyukiNakagawa']","Acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently occurs after cardiac surgery. Recently, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), a less invasive option for aortic stenosis (AS), has been increasingly performed, particularly in elderly patients. We retrospectively investigated and compared the incidence and risk factors of postoperative AKI in patients who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and TAVI. This was a retrospective single-center study. Seven days postoperatively, data were obtained from medical records. Patients were classified into SAVR and TAVI groups based on age, according to the policy of the Japanese Circulation Society. A total of 155 patients underwent surgery for AS between January 2020 and December 2021. Variables included age, sex, risk score, preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction, hypertension, and renal dysfunction. AKI was defined in accordance with the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. A total of 33 SAVR and 79 TAVI procedures were included in this study. The incidences of AKI in the SAVR and TAVI groups were 45.5% and 43.0%, respectively. No significant differences existed between the two groups. Weight (p = 0.0392) and pre-renal dysfunction (p = 0.0308) affected the incidence of AKI in the SAVR group, whereas no such variables were identified in the TAVI group. Within the current age-based treatment selection criteria for AS, no significant difference in the incidence of AKI was observed between the two procedures.Although preoperative renal function may be associated with postoperative AKI, further studies are required to select the optimal surgical procedure for patients with renal dysfunction.",kidney disease

We review the recent literature related to these topics in conjunction with the existing treatment recommendations, highlighting areas of uncertainty and providing guidance towards facilitating the care of SLE patients.",kidney disease
,"['SumathyMathialagan', 'GitChung', 'KeithPye', 'A DavidRodrigues', 'Manthena V SVarma', 'ColinBrown']","Creatinine, a clinical marker for kidney function, is predominantly cleared by glomerular filtration, with active tubular secretion contributing to about 30% of its renal clearance. Recent studies suggested the potential involvement of organic anion transporter (OAT)2, in addition to the previously known organic cation transporter (OCT)2-mediated basolateral uptake, in creatinine active secretion. Here, we characterized the transport mechanisms of creatinine using transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells and freshly prepared human primary renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (hPTCs). Creatinine showed transport by OAT2 in transfected HEK293 cells. In addition, creatinine and metformin showed transport by OCT2 and multidrug & toxin extrusion pump (MATE)1 and MATE2K, while penciclovir was selective for OAT2. Time-dependent cell accumulation was observed for creatinine and metformin in hPTCs. Their accumulation was increased by pyrimethamine, but inhibited by decynium-22, likely due to differential inhibition of OCT2 versus MATEs. Additionally, indomethacin (OAT2 inhibitor) reduced penciclovir uptake (~75%) in hPTCs illustrating functional OAT2 activity. However, no modulation of creatinine and metformin cell accumulation was apparent with indomethacin. Creatinine transport characteristics in the presence of inhibitors approached those of metformin, an OCT2/MATE substrate, but were distinct from those of penciclovir, an OAT2-selective substrate. Moreover, indomethacin showed no significant effect on the basolateral-to-apical transport and net secretion of creatinine across hPTC monolayers. Collectively, the functional studies suggest OCT2 as the primary basolateral uptake mechanism, and that OAT2 has a minimal role, in creatinine renal secretion. Our results highlight the utility of hPTCs to enable the functional assessment of renal transport mechanisms. ",kidney disease
Butyrate induces STAT3/HIF-1α/IL-22 signaling via GPCR and HDAC3 inhibition to activate autophagy in head kidney macrophages from turbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.).,"['JinjinZhang', 'WentaoWang', 'ShufeiLiang', 'XueqiZhou', 'Rokeya SultanaRekha', 'Gudmundur HGudmundsson', 'PeterBergman', 'QinghuiAi', 'KangsenMai', 'MinWan']","As one of short-chain fatty acids, butyrate is an important metabolite of dietary fiber by the fermentation of gut commensals. Our recent study uncovered that butyrate promoted IL-22 production in fish macrophages to augment the host defense. In the current study, we further explored the underlying signaling pathways in butyrate-induced IL-22 production in fish macrophages. Our results showed that butyrate augmented the IL-22 expression in head kidney macrophages (HKMs) of turbot through binding to G-protein receptor 41 (GPR41) and GPR43. Moreover, histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) inhibition apparently up-regulated the butyrate-enhanced IL-22 generation, indicating HDACs were engaged in butyrate-regulated IL-22 secretion. In addition, butyrate triggered the STAT3/HIF-1α signaling to elevate the IL-22 expression in HKMs. Importantly, the evidence in vitro and in vivo was provided that butyrate activated autophagy in fish macrophages via IL-22 signaling, which contributing to the elimination of invading bacteria. In conclusion, we clarified in the current study that butyrate induced STAT3/HIF-1α/IL-22 signaling pathway via GPCR binding and HDAC3 inhibition in fish macrophages to activate autophagy that was involved in pathogen clearance in fish macrophages.",kidney disease
Lycibarbarspermidine L from the fruit of Lycium barbarum L. recovers intestinal barrier damage via regulating miR-195-3p.,"['XueniZhang', 'XiaoyanWen', 'DiZhou', 'YuhangLiang', 'ZhengqunZhou', 'GangChen', 'WeiLi', 'HaoGao', 'NingLi']","The fruit of Lycium barbarum L. is widely employed with the traditional effect of tonic properties. According to the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, Gou Qi can be distributed in the meridian of stomach, as well as the liver and kidney, indicating its effect on the digestive system. Clinical studies found that Gou Qi enhanced gastrointestinal functions. Pharmacological research showed the extract of Lycium barbarum exhibiting a repaired effect on the intestine barrier. Lycibarbarspermidine L (LBS L), which belongs to polyamines, is separated from the fruit of Lycium barbarum. However, it is unknown whether LBS L can restore damaged intestinal barrier like other polyamines such as spermidine.
To elucidate the recovery effect of LBS L on damaged intestinal epithelium and its miRNA-related mechanism.
IEC-6 cells were used in vitro to assess the therapeutic effect of LBS L on the injured intestine and the regulation of miR-195-3p. Spermidine (SPD) with intestinal mucosal repair effect was used as a positive control. Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were subjected to 48 h fasting to induce intestinal epithelial atrophy in vivo. To determine the therapeutic effect of LBS L on injured intestinal epithelium and explore the mechanism, the fasting model group rats were treated with LBS L (25 mg/kg) for 4 days.
Results in vitro showed that LBS L (10 μM) promoted cell proliferation and migration, affecting the S phase of the cell cycle. Western blot signals showed that LBS L raised the expression level of occludin. The miR-195-3p levels were decreased following LBS L treatment, which could be inversed by transfecting miR-195-3p mimic, demonstrating that LBS L inhibited miR-195-3p to improve cell growth. Results in vivo showed that LBS L could reverse the atrophic villi and inflammatory cell infiltration in the submucosa and restore miR-195-3p, occludin, and Ki67 levels in the intestine of mice in the fasting group.

AR/RKIP pathway mediates the inhibitory effects of icariin on renal fibrosis and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition in type 2 diabetic nephropathy.,"['WenhuiYao', 'RongpinTao', 'YueXu', 'Zhe-ShengChen', 'XuanshengDing', 'LishengWan']","Herba epimedium brevicornu maxim is traditionally known as a sexual enhancement, and has the effect of tonifying kidney yang. Icariin is a flavonoid extracted from epimedium brevicornu maxim, and has been shown to improve nephropathy disease.
This study investigated the possible role of icariin in regulating renal EndMT in type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN).
Male type 2 diabetic Sprague Dawley rats, Male D2.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J (db/db) mice, and mouse glomerular endothelial cells were utilized to evaluate the effect of icariin. Western blotting, Q-PCR, immunohistochemistry, H&E, Masson staining, immunofluorescence, and siRNA transfection, were performed in this study.
The inhibitory function of icariin in renal fibrosis and renal EndMT was verified in type 2 diabetic animals. Methyltestosterone suppressed renal fibrosis and EndMT in db/db mice. Androgen receptor (AR), the major receptor of testosterone, was upregulated by icariin. The AR antagonist MDV3100, blocked the inhibition by icariin in renal EndMT, revealing that icariin repressed renal EndMT by activating AR. In addition, icariin and methyltestosterone upregulated the Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) in db/db mice. Furthermore, siRNA-RKIP inhibited the effect of icariin on EndMT. The MEK/ERK pathway, as the downstream pathway of RKIP, was suppressed by icariin and methyltestosterone. Of note, the effect of icariin on the MEK/ERK pathway was abolished by MDV3100 or siRNA-RKIP.
These results supported that icariin targeted AR/RKIP/MEK/ERK pathway to suppress renal fibrosis and EndMT in T2DN.",kidney disease

Pax protein depletion in proximal tubules triggers conserved mechanisms of resistance to acute ischemic kidney injury preventing transition to chronic kidney disease.,"['Jeffrey ABeamish', 'Asha CTelang', 'Madison CMcElliott', 'AnasAl-Suraimi', 'MahboobChowdhury', 'Jenna TFerence-Salo', 'Edgar AOtto', 'RajasreeMenon', 'AbdulSoofi', 'Joel MWeinberg', 'Sanjeevkumar RPatel', 'Gregory RDressler']","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common condition that lacks effective treatments. In part, this shortcoming is due to an incomplete understanding of the genetic mechanisms that control pathogenesis and recovery. Identifying the molecular and genetic regulators unique to nephron segments that dictate vulnerability to injury and regenerative potential could lead to new therapeutic targets to treat ischemic kidney injury. Pax2 and Pax8 are homologous transcription factors with overlapping functions that are critical for kidney development and are re-activated in AKI. Here, we examined the role of Pax2 and Pax8 in recovery from ischemic AKI and found them upregulated after severe AKI and correlated with chronic injury. Surprisingly, proximal-tubule-selective deletion of Pax2 and Pax8 resulted in a less severe chronic injury phenotype. This effect was mediated by protection against the acute insult, similar to pre-conditioning. Prior to injury, Pax2 and Pax8 mutant mice develop a unique subpopulation of proximal tubule cells in the S3 segment that displayed features usually seen only in acute or chronic injury. The expression signature of these cells was strongly enriched with genes associated with other mechanisms of protection against ischemic AKI including caloric restriction, hypoxic pre-conditioning, and female sex. Thus, our results identified a novel role for Pax2 and Pax8 in mature proximal tubules that regulates critical genes and pathways involved in both the injury response and protection from ischemic AKI.",kidney disease
The goldfish primary kidney macrophage system.,"['XionglinLi', 'XinyuanYue', 'JiasongXie']","Miodrag (Mike) Belosevic and collaborators profoundly influenced the development of primary kidney macrophage culturing system (PKM) to study fish immunology in various aspects of comparative immunology. Their application of using PKM model, opened a new path for studying the development of macrophages, regulation of hematopoiesis, and cell specific response against various pathogens. By measuring histopathological and immunological outcomes, the biological implications of a variety of cytokines and signal transduction molecules could be elucidated with the established PKM system. A variety of growth factors mediating hematopoiesis and cytokines regulating the immune responses were functionally characterized, which served as a fundamental basis for making goldfish an excellent model to study fish immunology. Specifically, using in vivo and PKM based in vitro assays, the Belosevic lab advanced the goldfish-M. marinum model to study the anti-mycobacteria responses in teleosts, thus paving a way for the development of novel therapeutic approaches which could be applied in aquaculture settings or utilized as a model for human disease.

Cells from human lung and kidney were infected with BKPyV and treated with commercially available intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIG). Its effects on BKPyV replication and spread of infection were investigated, focusing on administration timing. IVIG treatment 3 h after infection suppressed BKPyV replication assessed by real-time PCR and expression of the VP1 capsid protein and large T-antigen. IVIG effectively reduced the number of BKPyV-infected cells 2 weeks after infection in an antibody titer-dependent manner. Virus release in the culture supernatants was not influenced by IVIG treatment 6-80 h and 3-9 days after infection. Collectively, IVIG did not affect viral release from infected cells but inhibited the spread of infection by neutralizing the released virus and blocking the new infected cell formation, indicating greater efficacy in early localized infection. BKPyV replication resumed in IVIG-treated cultures at 7 days after IVIG removal. Early prophylactic administration of IVIG is expected to reduce the growth and spread of BKPyV infection, resulting in the reduction of infected cell lesions and prevention of BKPyV-associated diseases.",kidney disease

It is the final outcome of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by an initial exacerbated inflammatory response, metabolic derangement and ultimate tissue scarring. A positive balance of cellular energy may result crucial for the recovery of clinical COVID-19. Hence, we asked if two key pathways involved in cellular energy generation, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) signaling and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) could be beneficial. We tested the drugs metformin (AMPK activator) and baicalin (CPT1A activator) in different experimental models mimicking COVID-19 associated inflammation in lung and kidney. We also studied two different cohorts of COVID-19 patients that had been previously treated with metformin. These drugs ameliorated lung damage in an ARDS animal model, while activation of AMPK/ACC signaling increased mitochondrial function and decreased TGF-β-induced fibrosis, apoptosis and inflammation markers in lung epithelial cells. Similar results were observed with two indole derivatives, IND6 and IND8 with AMPK activating capacity. Consistently, a reduced time of hospitalization and need of intensive care was observed in COVID-19 patients previously exposed to metformin. Baicalin also mitigated the activation of pro-inflammatory bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and reduced kidney fibrosis in two animal models of kidney injury, another key target of COVID-19. In human epithelial lung and kidney cells, both drugs improved mitochondrial function and prevented TGF-β-induced renal epithelial cell dedifferentiation. Our results support that favoring cellular energy production through enhanced FAO may prove useful in the prevention of COVID-19-induced lung and renal damage.",kidney disease
Comparing U.S. and Canadian treatment patterns on venous thromboembolism outcomes in the GARFIELD-VTE registry.,"['Adrian CChen', 'Amit SRao', 'AlishaOropallo', 'Samuel ZGoldhaber', 'Meg EFluharty', 'UmaMaheshwari', 'MarcCarrier', 'Alexander G GTurpie', 'KarenPieper', 'GloriaKayani', 'Ajay KKakkar', 'NoneNone']","Economically developed countries continue to find that venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.
To compare baseline risk profiles and patient workflow patterns between the United States (U.S.) and Canadian management of VTE patients from 2014 to 2017.
The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD (GARFIELD-VTE) is a prospective, observational study of 10,679 patients with objectively confirmed VTE, followed for 3 years. In total 1101 patients enrolled in the U.S. and Canada were included in this analysis.
Median age and body mass index were comparable between the U.S. (60.5; 30.2) and Canadian (59.7; 29) patients. A higher percentage of U.S. patients were black (n = 128, 24.1 %; n = 22, 3.9 %) and had a higher VTE-associated risk profile, including immobilization, hospitalization, and recent surgery. U.S. patients had a higher combined DVT and PE primary diagnoses (20.3 %) and were more likely to be treated in hospitals (77.2 %) than Canadians (13.3 %; 48.1 %). Direct oral anticoagulant therapy (DOAC) was nearly two-fold more frequent in Canadian patients (n = 218, 39.2 %) at the end of 3 years in comparison to the U.S. (n = 118, 23.0 %). Adjusted for sex, recent bleed event, heart failure, chronic immobilization, family history of VTE, history of cancer and prior VTE, and renal insufficiency, the risk of all-cause mortality was 51.9 % higher in patients from the U.S. compared to those in Canada after 3 years. Patients from the U.S. also had a higher likelihood of hospitalization, major bleeding, and recurrent VTE after controlling for prior history and comorbid conditions.

Only 10 cases of adult MRTK have been reported. Here, we present a case of MRTK in an adult patient and discuss its clinical findings, diagnostic challenges, and treatment outcome. We also perform literature review on this issue.
Our patient was a 29-year-old woman presented with fever and hematuria. She also mentioned atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor of cerebellum in her deceased child. Initial diagnostic work up led to left partial nephrectomy with the pathology report of high grade undifferentiated tumor. Early tumor recurrence necessitated left radical nephrectomy with extensive excision of adjacent tissues. Pathology for second specimen considering disease course and family history was MRTK. Even though chemotherapy was administered, she died few months later due to multiple metastases.
Although diagnosis is challenging in all 11 reported cases -including our case- of adult MRTK, immunohistochemistry (i.e., negative reaction for INI-1) in conjunction with clinical and radiological findings are the main tool to reach diagnosis. Treatment options are much more diverse, ranging from surgery to immunotherapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy, and combination of these modalities. Prognosis remains dismal with the mean survival period of 7 months.
Although extremely rare, MRTK might happen in adults. We report the first case of adult MRTK with positive family history of rhabdoid tumor of CNS, underscoring the importance of family history in reaching the diagnosis and highlighting the role of genetics in this rare disease.",kidney disease

Gualou xiebai decoction ameliorates cardiorenal syndrome type II by regulation of PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signalling pathway.,"['Ying-YuWang', 'Yang-YangLiu', 'JieLi', 'Yun-YunZhang', 'Yong-FangDing', 'Yun-RuPeng']","Cardiorenal syndromes type II (CRS2) is a multi-organ ailment that manifests as a combination of cardiac and renal dysfunction, resulting in chronic kidney disease due to chronic cardiac insufficiency. It affects at least 26 million people worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing. Gualou Xiebai Decoction (GXD), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with a rich history of application in the management of coronary artery disease, has been explored for its potential therapeutic benefits in CRS2. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which GXD alleviates CRS2 remains obscure, necessitating further investigation.
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the ethanolic extract of GXD on CRS2 and to elucidate the underlying mechanism in a rat model of myocardial infarction, offering a potential target for clinical treatment for CRS2.
A rat model of CRS2 was induced by surgical myocardial infarction and treated with GXD for 10 weeks. Cardiac function was assessed using echocardiography, while serum and urine biochemistry were analyzed to evaluate potential cardiac and renal damage. Furthermore, tissue samples were obtained for histological, protein, and genetic investigations. In addition, network pharmacology analysis and molecular docking were utilized to predict the primary active compounds, potential therapeutic targets, and interventional pathways through which GXD could potentially exert its effects on CRS2. Subsequently, these predictions were confirmed in vivo and vitro through various analyses.
The current investigation employed echocardiography to exhibit the apparent cardiac remodeling following the induction of myocardial infarction. Damage to the heart and kidneys of CRS2 rats was effectively ameliorated by administration of GXD. The outcomes derived from the analyses of HE and Masson staining indicated that the pathological damage to the heart and kidney tissues of rats in the GXD groups was considerably alleviated. Using network pharmacology analysis, AKT1, IL-6, and TNF-α were identified as plausible therapeutic targets for the treatment of CRS with GXD. Subsequent functional and pathway enrichment analysis of the underlying targets disclosed that the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway may be involved in the mechanism of GXD in the treatment of CRS2. Immunohistochemical, western blot, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining were employed to demonstrate that GXD can regulate the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB signaling pathway in the CRS2 rat model. Ultimately, administration of the PI3K/AKT agonist 740Y-P counteracted the effect of diosmetin, which was one of the potential active components of GXD analysed by compound-target-disease network, on p-PI3K and p-AKT in vitro.
The findings of this study suggest that GXD improves cardiac and renal function in CRS2 rats and that the underlying mechanism involves inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway.",kidney disease

This was a qualitative descriptive study.Twelve participants aged over 60 years who underwent kidney transplantation were recruited from a kidney transplant clinic in a hospital in South Korea. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted from March to April 2021. The data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.
Four main themes were identified: 1) hesitation towards complex and risky kidney transplant, 2) internal suffering due to social prejudice and limits, 3) taking a step back from the decision-making process, and 4) being rushed into a decision on the brink of death.
Older patients with end-stage renal disease experience hesitation and difficulties and are passive in the decision-making process for a kidney transplant. They lacked sufficient relevant information and decided to receive transplant surgery, feeling pressured by the recommendations of family and healthcare providers.
Healthcare professionals should help older patients with end-stage renal disease make proactive decisions by providing tailored education programs and improving communication between the patients and their family members. Changing negative social perceptions and implementing supportive policies are necessary to resolve the difficulties experienced by such patients.

We systematically studied indeterminate PALF cases referred for genetic evaluation by whole-exome sequencing (WES), and analyzed phenotypic and biochemical markers, and the diagnostic yield of WES in this condition.
With this international, multicenter observational study, patients (0-18 y) with indeterminate PALF were analyzed by WES. Data on the clinical and biochemical phenotype were retrieved and systematically analyzed.
In total, 260 indeterminate PALF patients from 19 countries were recruited between 2011 and 2022, of whom 59 had recurrent PALF (RALF). WES established a genetic diagnosis in 37% of cases (97/260). Diagnostic yield was highest in children with PALF in the first year of life (46%), and in children with RALF (64%). Thirty-six distinct disease genes were identified.

We analysed the predictors of terlipressin response and mortality using point-of-care echocardiography (POC-Echo), cardiac and renal biomarkers.
Between December 2021 and January 2023, patients with HRS-AKI were assessed with POC-Echo and lung ultrasound within 6h of admission, at the time of starting terlipressin(48h), and at 72h. Volume expansion was done with 20% albumin, followed by terlipressin infusion. Clinical data, POC-Echo data, and serum biomarkers were prospectively collected. Cirrhotic Cardiomyopathy(CCM) was defined per 2020 criteria.
One hundred and forty patients were enrolled [84% men, 59% alcohol-associated disease, mean MELDNa-25±standard deviation(SD) 5.6]. Median daily dose of infused terlipressin was 4.3(interquartile range:3.9-4.6)mg/day; mean duration-6.4± SD-1.9 days; complete response was in 62% and partial response in 11%. Overall mortality was 14% and 16% at 30 and 90 days, respectively. Cut-offs for prediction of terlipressin nonresponse were cardiac variables-[E/e'>12.5(indicating increased left filling pressures, C-statistic-0.774), e' velocity<7 cm/s (indicating impaired relaxation; C-statistic-0.791), >20.5% reduction in cardiac index at 72h(C-statistic-0.885); p<0.001] and pre-treatment biomarkers (Cystatin C>2.2 mg/l, C-statistic-0.640 and NT-ProBNP>350 pg/mL, C-statistic-0.655;p<0.050). About 6% of all HRS-AKI patients and 26% of patients with CCM had pulmonary edema. Presence of CCM(aHR1.9;CI-1.8-4.5,p=0.009) and terlipressin nonresponse (aHR 5.2;CI-2.2-12.2, p<0.001) were predictors of mortality independent of age, gender, obesity, DM-2, etiology and baseline creatinine.
Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy and reduction in cardiac index, reliably predict terlipressin non-response. CCM is independently associated with poor survival in HRS-AKI.",kidney disease
"RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SICKLE CELL NEPHROPATHY AND SOME BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS OF HAEMOLYSIS AMONGST PATIENTS WITH SICKLE CELL ANAEMIA IN KANO, NORTHWESTERN NIGERIA.","['MMahdi', 'R ADachi', 'IMusa', 'S GAhmed', 'A KGwarzo', 'AIsmail', 'AAbdu', 'F GMustapha']","Advancements in the care of patients with sickle cell anaemia have led to significant improvement in survival with many patients reaching adulthood. As they age, long-term complications of the disease manifest in them, notable amongst which is nephropathy which is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in them. There is limited information about sickle cell nephropathy and some biochemical markers of haemolysis that can detect it early in our setting. This study aimed to determine the relationship between some indirect markers of haemolysis and sickle cell nephropathy.
The study was a descriptive cross-sectional one where 204 adolescent and adult patients with sickle cell anaemia attending the clinic of AKTH Kano were recruited. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was utilized. Blood samples were taken for determination of serum bilirubin, LDH, and reticulocyte count. Spot urine was used to quantitatively determine albumin to creatinine ratio. Data collated was analyzed using SPSS version 22.0. P-value <0.05 was considered significant.
Two hundred and four (204) participants were enrolled in to the study. Their mean age was 19.6±5years. Females were the majority 131/204 (64.2%). The median (IQR) serum lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, direct bilirubin, and reticulocyte count were 607.0(487.3-758.5) U/L, 54.5(37.0-119.0) umol/L, 16.0(11.3-29.0) umol/L and 4.0(3.0-8.4%) respectively. Sickle cell nephropathy was found in 29/204 (14.2%). There were positive significant associations between sickle cell nephropathy with raised serum bilirubin and serum lactate dehydrogenase (p-value = 0.02 and 0.032 respectively).
Sickle cell nephropathy is common amongst patients with sickle cell anaemia and raised serum bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase are predictors of sickle cell nephropathy.",kidney disease
PREVALENCE OF RENAL DYSFUNCTION IN ACUTE STROKE PATIENTS AT ABAKALIKI NIGERIA: AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY.,['C OEze'],"Renal dysfunction is commonly seen in hospitalized stroke patients. It serves both as a risk factor for stroke and as a complication of stroke. Renal dysfunction is a poor prognostic factor for stroke and increases the risk of recurrence. Despite the above poor indices, there is a paucity of data on the prevalence of renal dysfunction in acute stroke patients in Nigeria.
It is against this background that this study was conducted to identify the prevalence and pattern of renal dysfunction among acute stroke patients who were managed at a Federal Teaching Hospital in Abakaliki Nigeria. Methodology: This is a cross-sectional observational hospital-based study undertaken at the Emergency unit of the Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital Abakaliki, Nigeria from October 2021 to April 2022 (7-month period).
Amongst the 210 acute stroke patients enrolled in the study, 51 (24%) had renal dysfunction with no age and sex predilection. Haemorrhagic stroke, alteration in consciousness, and anaemia were significantly associated with renal dysfunction.
The prevalence of renal dysfunction following acute stroke is high and there is a need for assessment of renal functions in every acute stroke patient and institute prompt multi-disciplinary treatment.",kidney disease
Impact of concurrent glomerulonephritis on outcomes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis.,"['Sarah PCohen', 'Andrew JWodarcyk', 'AlexanderWong', 'Kevin CPatterson', 'Matthew ILyons', 'AlexisBarnes', 'AlanStrickland', 'XueliangPan', 'SalemAlmaani', 'Alexa SMeara', 'Elliott DCrouser', 'Mark DWewers', 'Lynn AFussner']","Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) commonly presents with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) and/or glomerulonephritis. Patients who present with DAH but without kidney involvement have been understudied.
Patients with DAH diagnosed by bronchoscopy and attributed to AAV over 8.5 years were retrospectively identified through electronic medical records and bronchoscopy reporting software. Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or prior kidney transplant were excluded. Characteristics, treatments, and outcomes were abstracted.
30 patients were identified with DAH secondary to AAV. Five with ESKD or prior kidney transplant, and one with concomitant anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, were excluded, leaving 24 patients for analysis. At the time of qualifying bronchoscopy, six patients had no apparent kidney involvement by AAV, while eight of 18 with kidney involvement required dialysis. Of the eight patients dialysed during the initial hospitalisation, four were declared to have ESKD and three died in the subsequent year (one of whom did both). None of the 16 patients without initial dialysis requirement developed kidney involvement requiring dialysis in the subsequent year, though three of the six without initial evidence of kidney involvement by AAV ultimately developed it. No patient without initial kidney involvement died during follow-up.
In our cohort, patients with DAH due to AAV without initial kidney involvement did not develop kidney involvement requiring dialysis or die during the follow-up period, though half of patients without initial evidence of kidney involvement subsequently developed it.

Whether the length of the fatty acid acylated to plasma sphingolipid species is associated with SCD risk is not known.
To determine whether the saturated fatty acid length of plasma ceramides and sphingomyelins influences the association with SCD risk.
In this cohort study, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the association of sphingolipid species with SCD risk. The study population included 4612 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study followed up prospectively for a median of 10.2 (IQR, 5.5-11.6) years. Baseline data were collected from January 1992 to December 1995 during annual examinations. Data were analyzed from February 11, 2020, to September 9, 2023.

In adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, plasma ceramides and sphingomyelins with palmitic acid (Cer-16 and SM-16) were associated with higher SCD risk per higher SD of log sphingolipid levels (hazard ratio [HR] for Cer-16, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.12-1.59]; HR for SM-16, 1.37 [95% CI, 1.12-1.67]). Associations did not differ by baseline age, sex, race, or body mass index. No significant association of SCD with sphingolipids with very-long-chain saturated fatty acids was observed after correction for multiple testing (HR for ceramide with arachidic acid, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.90-1.24]; HR for ceramide with behenic acid, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.77-1.10]; HR for ceramide with lignoceric acid, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.77-1.09]; HR for sphingomyelin with arachidic acid, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.71-0.98]; HR for sphingomyelin with behenic acid, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.70-1.00]; HR for sphingomyelin with lignoceric acid, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.72-1.03]).

We assessed 22 donors and 23 patients requiring renal transplantation over up to 1 year posttransplant. We measured choroidal thickness (CT) and area and compared our automated CT measurements to manual ones at the same locations. We estimated associations between choroidal measurements and markers of renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR], serum creatinine, and urea) using correlation and linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling.
There was good agreement between manual and automated CT. Automated measures were more precise because of smaller measurement error over time. External adjudication of major discrepancies was in favor of automated measures. Significant differences were observed in the choroid pre- and posttransplant in both cohorts, and LME modeling revealed significant linear associations observed between choroidal measures and renal function in recipients. Significant associations were mostly stronger with automated CT (eGFR, P < 0.001; creatinine, P = 0.004; urea, P = 0.04) compared to manual CT (eGFR, P = 0.002; creatinine, P = 0.01; urea, P = 0.03).
Our automated approach has greater precision than human-performed manual measurements, which may explain stronger associations with renal function compared to manual measurements. To improve detection of meaningful associations with clinical endpoints in longitudinal studies of OCT, reducing measurement error should be a priority, and automated measurements help achieve this.
We introduce a novel choroid segmentation algorithm that can replace manual grading for studying the choroid in renal disease and other clinical conditions.",kidney disease
Exercise for Chronic Kidney Disease: Effect on Vascular and Cardiopulmonary Function.,"['Danielle LKirkman', 'Domenico AChavez']","Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have an exacerbated prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vascular dysfunction, characterized by impaired endothelial function and arterial stiffness, and markedly low cardiorespiratory fitness levels are hallmark manifestations of the disease that contribute to the CVD burden. Despite advancements in blood pressure and lipid lowering pharmacological therapies, CVD remains highly prevalent across the spectrum of CKD. This highlights a stagnation in effective clinical strategies to improve cardiovascular health and reinforces critical need for adjuvant lifestyle strategies such as physical activity and exercise training to be incorporated into routine clinical care. This narrative review provides an overview of the known effects of exercise on cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary function across the spectrum of CKD.

One of the problems is that many COVID-19 cases develop acute kidney injuries. Still, it is heavily debated whether SARS-CoV-2 virus enters and actively replicates in kidney tissue and if SARS-CoV-2 virus particles can be detected in kidney during or post-infection. Here, we demonstrated that nucleocapsid N protein was detected in kidney tubular epithelium of patients that already recovered form COVID-19. The presence of the abundantly produced N protein without signs of viral replication could have implications for the recurrence of kidney disease and have a continuing effect on the immune system.",kidney disease

Statin therapy for patients with diabetic nephropathy: balance between safety and efficacy of statin treatment for patients with impaired kidney function.,"['A AJairoun', 'C CPing', 'BIbrahim']","The International Diabetes Federation estimates that by 2035, there will be 592 million people with diabetes worldwide, substantially increasing from the 382 million patients with diabetes recorded in 2013. Diabetes-related nephropathy is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Recently, the therapeutic use of statins in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) was explored in a series of meta-analyses, which revealed their potential for decreasing mortality and cardiovascular complications in this population, although not in patients undergoing hemodialysis. The current study reviews the current state of knowledge on statin therapy regarding its safety and efficacy concerning renal outcomes in diabetic patients with CKD. The evidence shows that statins may offer a beneficial renoprotective effect in inhibiting the progression of renal function decline. This effect is time-dependent and particularly strong in patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy. In addition, whether certain statin types are more beneficial than others in slowing renal function loss and reducing proteinuria remains unclear.

Evaluation of renal arterial resistive index in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis.,"['ZGok Sargin', 'MBayav', 'IDusunceli', 'UCelik', 'YUstundag']","Biliary obstruction has been shown to cause acute renal failure. The Renal Resistive Index (RRI) has been recognized to be an important index for evaluating changes in renal plasma flow and renal damage in cholestatic patients. We aimed to investigate the effects of cholestasis on renal hemodynamics in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis by RRI.
The prospective study included patients with extrahepatic cholestasis due to benign biliary stricture, choledocholithiasis, or periampullary tumor between January 1, 2022, and December 31, 2022. Renal and liver function tests, as well as renal doppler ultrasound for RRIs, were conducted before and after cholestasis treatment.
Patients who experienced cholestasis resolution after treatment showed lower cholestasis enzymes and bilirubin values and higher glomerular filtration rates compared to pre-treatment values. RRI values significantly decreased in patients with resolved cholestasis compared to pre-treatment levels (p=0.009). Patients with malignant cholestasis had higher RRI values than those with benign cholestasis (p=0.006). Bilirubin levels were higher (p=0.001), and glomerular filtration rates were lower (p=0.046) in patients with malignant cholestasis compared to those with benign cholestasis.
Acute renal injury in cholestatic patients can be demonstrated non-invasively by RRI and is reversible once cholestasis has resolved. Patients with benign cholestasis had lower RRI values than those with cholestasis due to periampullary tumors.",kidney disease

Forty adult male Wistar rats were equally divided into four groups. 1-Negative control group, 2-positive control group (Gentamicin), 3-Naringenin+AG+CW, 4-Gentamicin+Naringenin+AG+CW: groups 2 and 4 were treated with gentamicin. After six weeks, the rats were anesthetized with diethyl ether, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture and dissected to collect the kidneys. Biochemical studies were performed to determine the levels of urea, creatinine, lipids, total antioxidant capacity, and lipid peroxide, antioxidant enzyme activity in the kidney, total phenolic content (TPC), radical-scavenging activity, calcium, magnesium, and potassium in AG, CW, and their mixture. Also, kidney histopathology was performed.
Renal injury manifests as elevated serum urea and creatinine levels. A significant increase in total cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and malondialdehyde (MDA) was also noted. The activities of antioxidant capacity (TAC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) significantly decreased in the serum. There was a reduction in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) activities in kidney homogenates. Gentamicin administration induces morphological changes in the kidneys. Oral administration of naringenin+AG+CW significantly overturned all of the above-mentioned abnormalities.
These results show that the naringenin+AG+CW combination exhibited an additive effect against renal dysfunction and structural damage through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, as well as replenishing and balancing intracellular and extracellular electrolytes. Therefore, oral administration of these three ingredients could potentially provide better protection and serve as a unique therapeutic tool against nephrotoxicity caused by gentamicin.",kidney disease
Prognostic factors and evaluation methods of acute kidney injury among sepsis patients with pulmonary infection.,"['WNi', 'H-DQin']","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is difficult to detect in the early stages, yet is commonly associated with sepsis and infectious shock, with pulmonary infection being the most frequent culprit. This study aimed to estimate risk factors and their effects on 28-day survival among sepsis patients with pulmonary infection complicated by AKI and assessed the prognostic values of some detection indicators.
From February 2019 to July 2021, the data of 151 patients admitted to the emergency intensive care unit (EICU) of Nanjing First Hospital with pulmonary infection complicated with sepsis were collected in this retrospective study. The patients were categorized into two groups (survivors and non-survivors) depending on the 28-day survival, compared their clinical characteristics, and analyzed the predictors of survival.
Cox regression analysis revealed that serum cystatin-C level, serum lactate level, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scoring system were independent risk factors for 28-day survival. In predicting 28-day survival, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for serum Cystatin-C level, serum lactate level, APACHE II score, and the three combinations was 0.74, 0.67, 0.71, and 0.86, respectively. Accordingly, the sensitivity and specificity of the three indicators of 28-day survival were 87.50% and 66.67%, respectively, which were superior to individual indicators.
Sepsis patients with pulmonary infection have a high risk of AKI, and multiple risk factors contribute to this risk. AKI patients may also be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including APACHE II scores, serum Cystatin-C levels, and serum lactate levels, all of which are commonly used to assess the outcomes.",kidney disease

We aimed to explore the relationship between different domains of sedentary behaviors and new-onset hypertension, investigate whether genetic susceptibility to hypertension modifies the relationship, and examine the extent to which the relationship is mediated by body mass index (BMI) and grip strength.
212 714 participants without baseline hypertension in the UK Biobank were enrolled. The three major sedentary behaviors (TV-watching, nonoccupational computer use, and driving) were measured using touch screen questionnaires. The primary outcome was new-onset hypertension.
During a median follow-up of 11.9 years, 13 983 participants developed hypertension. There was a linear positive association between TV-watching time and new-onset hypertension (p for nonlinearity =0.868). A J-shaped association was found for nonoccupational computer use time and driving time with new-onset hypertension, with an inflection point of 0.5 h/day for both (both p for nonlinearity <0.001). Polygenetic risk scores for hypertension (based on 118 related single-nucleotide polymorphisms) did not significantly modify these associations (all p-interactions >0.05). Furthermore, the detrimental effects of long-term sedentary behaviors on hypertension were mediated by BMI by 21%-30%, and the beneficial effects of limited sitting time (within 0.5 h/day) for driving and nonoccupational computer use were mediated by grip strength by 6-25%.

We present the case of a 3-year-old pediatric recipient with urethral atresia and end-stage kidney disease who received a robotically procured living donor right pelvic kidney with two short same-size renal veins and a short ureter.
We utilized a completely deceased iliac vein system (common iliac vein with both external and internal veins) to extend the two renal veins. Due to the distance between both renal veins, the external iliac vein was anastomosed to the upper hilum renal vein, and the internal iliac vein was anastomosed to the lower hilum renal vein. The donor's short ureter was anastomosed to the recipient's ureter end-to-side.
The patient had immediate graft function and there were no post-operative complications. Renal ultrasound was unremarkable at 48 hours post-transplant. Serum creatinine was 0.5 mg/dL at 3 months post-transplant.
We demonstrate the successful transplantation of a robotically procured right pelvic donor kidney with two short renal veins using a deceased donor iliac vein system for venous reconstruction without increasing technical complications. This technique of venous reconstruction can be used in right kidneys with similar anatomical variations without affecting graft function.",kidney disease
Renal safety and survival among acutely ill hospitalized patients treated by blockers of the Renin-Angiotensin axis or loop diuretics: a single-center retrospective analysis.,"['MayAssaly', 'YuriGorelik', 'Samuel NHeyman', 'ZaidAbassi', 'MogherKhamaisi']","Concern exists regarding the renal safety of blocking the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) during acute illness, especially in the presence of volume depletion and hemodynamic instability.
We explored the impact of loop diuretics and RAS blockers on the likelihood of developing acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute kidney functional recovery (AKR) among inpatients. Adjusted odds ratio for AKI, AKR and mortality was calculated, using logistic regression models, with subgroup analysis for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 ml/min/1.73 m2, corrected for blood pressure measurements.
53,289 patients were included. RAS blockade was associated with reduced adjusted odds ratio for both AKI (0.76, CI 0.70-0.83) AKR (0.55, 0.52-0.58), and mortality within 30 days (0.44, 0.41-0.48), whereas loop diuretics were associated with increased risk of AKI (3.75, 3.42-4.12) and mortality (1.71, 1.58-1.85) and reduced AKR (0.71, 0.66-0.75). Comparable impact of RAS blockers and loop diuretics on renal outcomes and death was found among 6,069 patients with eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73m
Reduced blood pressure, RAS blockers and diuretics affect the odds of developing AKI or AKR among inpatients, suggesting possible disruption in renal functional reserve (RFR). As long as blood pressure is maintained, RAS inhibition seems to be safe and renoprotective in this population, irrespective of kidney function upon admission, and is associated with reduced mortality.",kidney disease
Association between albumin corrected anion gap and all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury: a retrospective study based on MIMIC-IV database.,"['PenghuiGao', 'JieMin', 'LeiZhong', 'MingjuShao']","The early identification of patients at high risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) with a poor prognosis is crucial to prevent complications and minimize mortality. This study sought to investigate the association between albumin-corrected anion gap (ACAG) and all-cause mortality among critically ill patients with AKI.
All eligible AKI patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV version 2.0) database were considered for participation in this study. We employed Kaplan-Meier curves to assess the 30-d and 360-d cumulative survival rates among various groups. Flexibly visualizing the connection between ACAG and mortality, we utilize restricted cubic splines (RCS) and multivariate Cox regression models. Result robustness underwent assessment through subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the predictive performance of ACAG.
The study included 9625 AKI participants, of whom 58.60% were male, and the 360-d all-cause mortality rate was 39.89%. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 30-d and 360-d cumulative survival rates for AKI patients were significantly lower in the high ACAG group than in the normal ACAG group. RCS analysis indicated that ACAG levels had a non-linear correlation with the risk of 30-d and 360-d mortality for AKI patients. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that ACAG is an independent risk indicator for 30-d and 360-d prognosis in AKI patients in the ICU.
Elevated ACAG levels (> 20 mmol/L) at ICU admission were associated with 30-d and 360-d all-cause mortality in critically ill patients with AKI.",kidney disease

A cost-effectiveness analysis of linagliptin add-on to insulin treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease in Iran.,"['Soroush AhmadiFariman', 'MarziehNosrati', 'ParhamRahmani', 'ShekoufehNikfar']","With the high prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), determining optimal treatment strategies has become a major concern. Linagliptin is aDPP-4 inhibitor that does not require dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of adding linagliptin to insulin therapy in patients with T2DM and mild (stage 2) or moderate (stage 3) CKD from a health system perspective in Iran.
We developed a cost-utility model using a decision tree and ran it separately for T2DM patients with mild or moderate CKD. Clinical outcomes and health-state utility values were extracted from published studies. Direct medical costs were obtained from national tariffs in Iran in 2021. We adopted an annual time horizon and calculated the difference in costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to obtain the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). To capture parameter uncertainties, one-way sensitivity analyses were also performed.
In T2DM patients with mild CKD, the linagliptin add-on strategy was associated with an additional $23.69 cost and 0.0148 QALYs per patient, resulting in an ICER of 1600.37 USD/QALY. In moderate CKD, the strategy was associated with $22.59 more costs and 0.0191 more QALYs, and the ICER was estimated at 1182.72 USD/QALY. In both populations, the ICER was mainly driven by the impact of HbA1c on utility, cost of linagliptin, and the reduction in insulin usage by adding linagliptin to the treatment.
With a cost-effectiveness threshold of $1550 USD/QALY in Iran, adding linagliptin to insulin is cost-effective in patients with T2DM and moderate CKD. However, for those with mild CKD, it seems that the associated costs outweigh the expected benefits.

In 2019, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study provided an annual estimation of the burden of 369 diseases and injuries in 204 countries from 1990 until 2019. The data estimating CKD and related mortality in Iran were collected from the disease registry, survey, and scientific literature. All-ages and age-standardised indices of incidence, prevalence, deaths, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were extracted for both sexes.
Since 1990, the age-standardized incidence (34.7% (95% uncertainty interval 30.8 - 38.8)) and prevalence (19.6% (17.7 - 21.8)) of CKD have risen, while a 21.5% (-28.8 - -15.4) and 18.0% (-35.4 - -10.8) decrease were noted in age-standardized DALYs and deaths rates, respectively. The lowest prevalence was reported in the eastern and western provinces.
Current study provides comprehensive knowledge about the CKD burden, suggesting the Iranian healthcare system has been more effective in averting deaths rather than managing morbidities. Multi-sectoral action plans are needed to strengthen preventive and early detection programs in high-risk areas.

Predictors of Short-term Mortality in Patients of Cirrhosis of Liver Presenting as Acute Kidney Injury: An In-hospital Prospective Observational Study.,"['BalajiMusunuri', 'SandeepGopal', 'Bailuru VTantry', 'SureshShenoy', 'Anurag JShetty']","Acute kidney injury (AKI) is known to be associated with increased short-term mortality among cirrhotic patients. On this background, we designed this study to evaluate various causes of AKI among admitted patients with cirrhosis of liver and predictors of 90-day mortality.
One hundred and two consecutive adult patients with cirrhosis of liver with AKI hospitalized between November 2016 and March 2018 were enrolled in this prospective study. Their detailed clinical profile, including biochemical parameters, the etiology of AKI, and their clinical outcome of survival or mortality at 90-days, were recorded.
The most common causes of AKI were infections, followed by hypovolemia, seen in 55.88% and 31.37% of the patients, respectively. Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) was seen in 10.78%, while parenchymal renal disease was the least common (1.9%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 28.4%, while 90-day mortality was 39.21%. The HRS group had a high 90-day mortality rate of 54.54%. ROC analysis of various biochemical parameters revealed that serum creatinine (sCr), Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), International Normalized Ratio (INR), and Neutrophil-Lymphocyte ratio (NLR), followed by Child Turcotte Pugh (CTP), had high area under the curves of 0.785, 0.773, 0.747, 0.740, and 0.718, respectively, for the prediction of 90-day mortality.
Infection is the commonest cause of AKI in cirrhosis; however, mortality in patients with HRS-AKI is higher than that in those with infection-related AKI. Serum creatinine at admission, INR, NLR, and CTP scores predict short-term mortality among patients with AKI in cirrhosis. Further, large prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.",kidney disease

Assessing the impact of discordant antibiotic treatment on adverse outcomes in community-onset UTI: a retrospective cohort study.,"['AnnaAryee', 'PatrickRockenschaub', 'JohnRobson', 'ZaheerAhmed', 'CaoimheNic Fhogartaigh', 'DavidBall', 'AndrewHayward', 'LauraShallcross']","To investigate the risk of adverse outcomes following discordant antibiotic treatment (urinary organism resistant) for culture-confirmed community-onset lower urinary tract infection (UTI).
Cohort study using routinely collected linked primary care, secondary care and microbiology data from patients with culture-confirmed community-onset lower UTI (COLUTI). Antibiotic treatment within ±3 days was considered concordant if the urinary organism was sensitive and discordant if resistant.The primary outcome was the proportion of patients experiencing urinary infection-related hospital admission (UHA) within 30 days. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients experiencing reconsultation within 30 days, and the odds of UHA and reconsultation following discordant treatment, adjusting for sex, age, risk factors for complicated UTI, previous antibiotic treatment, recurrent UTI and comorbidities.
A total of 11 963 UTI episodes in 8324 patients were included, and 1686 episodes (14.1%, 95% CI 13.5%-14.7%) were discordant. UHA occurred in 212/10 277 concordant episodes (2.1%, 95% CI 1.8%-2.4%) and 88/1686 discordant episodes (5.2%, 95% CI 4.2%-6.4%). Reconsultation occurred in 3961 concordant (38.5%, 95% CI 37.6%-39.5%) and 1472 discordant episodes (87.3%, 95% CI 85.6%-88.8%). Discordant treatment compared with concordant was associated with increased odds of UHA (adjusted OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.77-3.0, P < 0.001) and reconsultation (adjusted OR 11.25, 95% CI 9.66-13.11, P < 0.001) on multivariable analysis. Chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus were also independently associated with increased odds of UHA.
One in seven COLUTI episodes in primary care were treated with discordant antibiotics. In higher risk patients requiring urine culture, empirical antibiotic choice optimization could meaningfully reduce adverse outcomes.",kidney disease
Erdheim-Chester Disease with Renal Mass Presentation: Report of the First Case From Palestine and a Review of the Literature.,"['Hanood BassamAbu Rass', 'MohammadAbuawad', 'YazanAbueideh', 'Ezzideen LuaiMalhis']","BACKGROUND Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), a form of non-Langerhans-cell histiocytosis, is extremely rare. The mean age of individuals with ECD is in their 50s. Histiocytic infiltration of vital organ systems is a potential cause of substantial morbidity, which is associated with the multisystemic form of ECD. This report presents the first case of ECD with renal abnormalities in Palestine. CASE REPORT A 54-year-old woman with no medical or surgical history presented with 6 months of bilateral flank pain with no radiation or fever. A physical examination revealed only bilateral flank pain. Urine tests showed microhematuria. Laboratory test results showed increased serum creatinine levels (1.21 mg/dL) and microcytic anemia. A CT scan revealed significant multi-organ abnormalities, including renal abnormalities with a hairy kidney sign, pericardial effusion, and an osteolytic lesion of the spine. The hairy kidney sign is pathognomonic for ECD, so the renal mass was biopsied to confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy showed foamy histiocytes, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Foamy histiocytes were CD68-positive and negative for S100, CD1a, and HMB45. PAx5 and CD3 immunostaining showed T-predominant B-lymphocyte mixtures. CONCLUSIONS In the setting of systemic symptoms and imaging abnormalities such as presence of the hairy kidney sign, pericardial effusion, and osteolytic lesion of the spine, it is necessary to examine the possibility of ECD and proceed with a biopsy for confirmation. This is the first case in Palestine to be reported and the second case worldwide with a renal mass as an atypical presentation.",kidney disease
Effect of MAFLD on albuminuria and the interaction between MAFLD and diabetes on albuminuria.,"['YufangLiu', 'SanbaoChai', 'XiaomeiZhang']","To investigate the effects of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and abnormal albuminuria and the interaction between MAFLD and diabetes on abnormal albuminuria.
Data of participants in the American 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. Hepatic steatosis was defined as median controlled attenuation parameter ≥248 dB/m, which was measured by ultrasound transient elastography. MAFLD was defined by evidence of hepatic steatosis on ultrasound in addition to any metabolic dysregulation. Hepatic fibrosis was detected by FibroScan and quantified by parameter of stiffness (E). Hepatic fibrosis was defined as E ≥ 9.7 kPa. As component of CKD, reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was defined as<60 mL/min/1.73 m
Data pertaining to 5119 participants were included in the analysis, with 40.6% hepatic normal, 52.1% MAFLD, and 7.2% hepatic fibrosis. Multivariable regression analyses showed that for abnormal albuminuria, the odds ratio (OR) was 0.82 (0.65-1.04) for MAFLD group and 1.73 (1.14.-,2.63) for hepatic fibrosis group, both taking the hepatic healthy group as reference. As for reduced eGFR, the OR was 0.68 (0.51-0.92) for MAFLD group and 0.93 (0.56-1.53) for hepatic fibrosis group. Diabetes was significantly related to greater risk of abnormal albuminuria (3.04 [2.70-3.42]) and reduced eGFR (1.53 [1.33-1.77]). With regard to the prevalence of abnormal albuminuria, the OR was 1.64 (1.03-2.60) for those with hepatic fibrosis only, 3.30 (2.80-3.89) for those with diabetes only, and 5.05 (3.30-7.72) for those with both two conditions. But there were neither additive interaction (relative excess risk due to interaction 0.56 [-1.41-.53], p = .577) nor multiplicative interaction (OR 0.81 [0.45-1.47], p = .492) between hepatic fibrosis and diabetes on the prevalence of abnormal albuminuria.
MAFLD with hepatic fibrosis is an independent risk factor for abnormal albuminuria, but it does not have interaction with diabetes on abnormal albuminuria.",kidney disease
"Transplantation, Waitlist Status and County Indices of Economic Health in West Virginia.","['KhaledShawwa', 'JesseThompson', 'VishyChaudhary', 'AnthonyParravani', 'MarkPoling', 'BethanyPellegrino', 'RebeccaSchmidt']","Kidney transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end stage kidney disease. Given lower rates of kidney transplant in West Virginia (WV), we searched for potential predictors, focusing on indices of economic health.
Data on initiation of kidney replacement therapy, being waitlisted for and receiving a kidney transplant between 1965 and 2020 were collected from United States Renal Data System (USRDS). Data on county poverty rate (PR) and economic distress were collected from the Appalachian Regional Commission.
Of the 23,055 WV patients identified, 2,999 (13%) were transplanted compared to 514,050 (15.3%) for the rest of the US (p< 0.001). Patients who never received a kidney transplant were from counties with higher PRs (17.95%) compared to transplanted patients (17.44%); p<0.001. Waitlisted patients (2,375) came from counties with lower PRs than those who were never waitlisted (17.48 vs 17.94%; p<0.001). Waitlisted patients were less likely to be from distressed or at-risk counties (32 vs 34.3%; p=0.05) than patients who were never waitlisted. In multivariable logistic regression, county PR remained an independent predictor of being transplanted (OR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.97; p=0.008) or waitlisted (OR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.84-0.96; p=0.001) per 5% increase in poverty rate after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, alcohol use, functional status and comorbid medical conditions. Group/employer health insurance appeared to modify the relationship between PR and waitlist, where PR remained an independent predictor of waitlisting among patients with insurance.
Waitlisted patients and transplant recipients from WV were more likely to hail from counties with lower PRs and those in better economic health.",kidney disease
Assessment HOMA as a predictor for new onset diabetes mellitus and diabetic complications in non-diabetic adults: a KoGES prospective cohort study.,"['JibeomLee', 'Moon-HyunKim', 'Ji-YongJang', 'Chang-MyungOh']","Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is a biomarker for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, the role of HOMA-IR in the non-diabetic is unclear. This study aimed to determine whether IR measured HOMA-IR value is associated with new onset diabetes as well as vascular disease and can be used as an early predictor for diabetes and vascular diseases in non-diabetic participants.
From a prospective community-based cohort of 10,030 individuals, 4314 individuals younger than 65 years and without diabetes were enrolled and divided into three groups by baseline HOMA-IR tertiles: low (n = 1454), moderate (n = 1414), and high (n = 1446). The primary outcome was new onset T2DM. Secondary outcomes were chronic kidney disease (CKD) and a composite of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke as macrovascular events.
The mean age was 51 years. The prevalence of hypertension and cholesterol and HbA1c were higher in the high HOMA-IR group. New onset T2DM (5.8%) and CKD (12.2%) incidence in the high HOMA-IR group was higher than that in the others. The prevalence of macrovascular events did not differ among groups. High-HOMA-IR was an independent risk factor for new onset T2DM (odds ratio 1.86 [1.17-2.96]; p = 0.01) and CKD (1.49 [1.12-1.98]; p = 0.01).
High HOMA-IR was an early predictor of new onset T2DM and CKD, regardless of HbA1c in non-diabetic individuals. Further research on the specific cut off value will be needed.",kidney disease

Oxidative stress has been reported to have a significant role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as peroxisomal disorders, but little is known on the intracellular activation of Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Strictly related to oxidative stress, a correct autophagic machinery is essential to eliminated oxidized proteins and damaged organelles. The aims of the current study are to investigate a possible implication of MAPK pathways and autophagy impairment as markers and putative therapeutic targets in X-ALD and ZSDs.
Three patients with ZSD (2 M, 1 F; age range 8-17 years) and five patients with X-ALD (5 M; age range 5- 22 years) were enrolled. A control group included 6 healthy volunteers. To evaluate MAPKs pathway, p-p38 and p-JNK were assessed by western blot analysis on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. LC3II/LC3I ratio was evaluated ad marker of autophagy.
X-ALD and ZSD patients showed elevated p-p38 values on average 2- fold (range 1.21- 2.84) and 3.30-fold (range 1.56- 4.26) higher when compared with controls, respectively. p-JNK expression was on average 12-fold (range 2.20-19.92) and 2.90-fold (range 1.43-4.24) higher in ZSD and X-ALD patients than in controls. All patients had altered autophagic flux as concluded from the reduced LC3II/I ratio.
In our study X-ALD and ZSD patients present an overactivation of MAPK pathways and an inhibition of autophagy. Considering the absence of successful therapies and the growing interest towards new therapies with antioxidants and autophagy inducers, the identification and validation of biomarkers to monitor optimal dosing and biological efficacy of the treatments is of prime interest.",kidney disease
LiverTox: Clinical and Research Information on Drug-Induced Liver Injury,[],"The kinase inhibitors are a large group of unique and potent antineoplastic agents which specifically target protein kinases that are altered in cancer cells and that account for some of their abnormal growth. Protein kinases are ubiquitous intracellular and cell surface proteins that play critical roles in cell signaling pathways involved in metabolism, injury responses, adaption, growth and differentiation. They act by adding a phosphate group to a protein (phosphorylation), usually on a specific amino acid which often makes the protein or enzyme ""active"". The human genome has more than 500 protein kinases and they can be classified as (1) tyrosine, (2) serine-theonine or (3) nonspecific (both), based upon their amino acid specificity. Many protein kinases are cell surface receptors and act to initiate an intracellular pathway of activation, after the receptor is engaged by its ligand, typically a cytokine or growth factor. Inhibitors of these kinases are called protein kinase receptor inhibitors. Other kinases are intracellular and take part in cell signaling. These kinases can be targeted by ""non-receptor"" protein kinases. Finally, some kinase inhibitors have specificity for multiple kinases and are called ""multi-kinase inhibitors."" Protein kinases can be specifically involved in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation and mutations may lead to unregulated growth and proliferation that is typical of cancerous cells. These mutated protein kinases represent an attractive target for anticancer agents. The potent activity and lack of generalized toxicity of the kinase inhibitors relate to the specificity of antagonist for the mutated protein. In like manner, their toxicity often relates to off-target activity, either to the unmutated kinase or to closely related, normal kinases. The protein kinases can be categorized based upon the amino acid that they phosphorylate: either serine, threonine or tyrosine. The tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors were the initial and are perhaps the best characterized kinase inhibitors. The protein kinase inhibitors are relatively recently developed agents, all having been introduced since 2001. They are unique and represent a major advance in cancer chemotherapy, away from broadly cytotoxic agents and towards drugs that specifically target the molecular abnormalities of cancer cells. The initial tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for use in the United States was imatinib (Gleevec: 2001) which is used to treat Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which has a mutated kinase receptor (BCR-ABL) that is created by the specific translocation that creates the Philadelphia chromosome. Imatinib is a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL kinase. The introduction of this first protein kinase inhibitor was followed by more than a dozen others within the next 10 years.",kidney disease
